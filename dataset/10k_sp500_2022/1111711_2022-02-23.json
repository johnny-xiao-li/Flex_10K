NiSource is the successor to an Indiana corporation organized in 1987 under the name of NIPSCO Industries, Inc., which changed its name to NiSource on April 14, 1999.\nNiSource’s principal subsidiaries include NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc., a natural gas distribution holding company, and NIPSCO, a gas and electric company. NiSource derives substantially all of its revenues and earnings from the operating results of these rate-regulated businesses.\nNiSource has two reportable segments: Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations. The following is a summary of the business for each reporting segment. Refer to Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 23, \"Segments of Business,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to each segment.\nGas Distribution Operations\nOur natural gas distribution operations serve approximately 3.2 million customers in six states. Through our wholly-owned subsidiary NiSource Gas Distribution Group, Inc., we own five distribution subsidiaries that provide natural gas to approximately 2.4 million residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, and Maryland. Additionally, we distribute natural gas to approximately 853,000 customers in northern Indiana through our wholly-owned subsidiary NIPSCO. We operate approximately 54,600 miles of distribution main pipeline plus the associated individual customer service lines and 1,000 miles of transmission main pipeline located in our service areas described below. Throughout our service areas we also have gate stations and other operations support facilities.\nWe earn revenues that are approved by the jurisdictions in which we operate for the delivery of natural gas to our customers.   The approved revenues include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in the cost of natural gas. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs, subject to reconciliation, and the amounts billed in current rates.\nElectric Operations\nWe generate, transmit and distribute electricity through our subsidiary NIPSCO to approximately 483,000 customers in 20 counties in the northern part of Indiana and also engage in wholesale electric and transmission transactions. We own and operate sources of generation as well as source power through PPAs. We continue to transition our generation portfolio to primarily renewable sources. During 2021, we operated Rosewater for the full year and Indiana Crossroads Wind went into service during December 2021. We also purchased energy generated from renewable sources through PPAs. In October 2021, NIPSCO completed the retirement of  two coal-burning units with installed capacity of approximately 903 MW at Schahfer Generating Station, located in Wheatfield, IN. As of December 31, 2021 we have multiple PPAs that provide 500 MW of capacity, with contracts expiring between 2024 and 2040. See below for information on our owned operating facilities:\n(1)\nRepresents current net generating capability of each fossil fuel and hydro generating unit. Nameplate capacity is listed for wind generating units.\n(2)\nNIPSCO is the managing partner of these joint ventures. Refer to Note 4, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNIPSCO’s transmission system, with voltages from 69,000 to 765,000 volts, consists of 3,024 circuit miles. NIPSCO is interconnected with eight neighboring electric utilities.\n6\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNIPSCO participates in the MISO transmission service and wholesale energy market. MISO is a nonprofit organization created in compliance with FERC regulations to improve the flow of electricity in the regional marketplace and to enhance electric reliability. Additionally, MISO is responsible for managing energy markets, transmission constraints and the day-ahead, real-time, Financial Transmission Rights and ancillary markets. NIPSCO transferred functional control of its electric transmission assets to MISO, and transmission service for NIPSCO occurs under the MISO Open Access Transmission Tariff. NIPSCO units are dispatched by MISO which takes into account economics, reliability of the MISO system and unit availability. During the year ended December 31, 2021, NIPSCO units were dispatched to meet 47.87% of its load requirements, and NIPSCO purchased 52.13% from the MISO market.\nBusiness Strategy\nWe focus our business strategy on providing safe and reliable service through our core, rate-regulated asset-based utilities, which generate substantially all of our operating income. Our utilities continue to move forward on core safety, infrastructure and environmental investment programs supported by complementary regulatory and customer initiatives across all six states in which we operate.  Our goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we (i) embark on long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs to better serve our customers, (ii) align our tariff structures with our cost structure, and (iii) address changing customer conservation patterns. These strategies focus on improving safety and reliability, enhancing customer service, ensuring customer affordability and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns.\nThe safety of our customers, communities and employees has been and remains our top priority. SMS is an established operating model within NiSource. With the continued support and advice from our Quality Review Board (a panel of third parties with safety operations expertise engaged by management to advise on safety matters), we are continuing to mature our SMS processes, capabilities and talent as we collaborate within and across industries to enhance safety and reduce operational risk. Additionally, we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on our system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner.\nIn November 2021, we submitted our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan with the IURC. The plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the Sugar Creek Generating Station, among other steps. Refer to Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion of these plans.\nThe NiSource Political Action Committee (\"NiPAC\") provides our employees a voice in the political process. NiPAC is a voluntary, employee and director driven and funded political action committee, and NiPAC makes bipartisan political contributions to local, state and federal candidates, where permitted and in accordance with established guidelines. Consistent with our commitments and our approach to engagement, the NiPAC leadership committee members evaluate candidates for support on issues important to our business.\nNatural Gas Competition\n. Open access to natural gas supplies over interstate pipelines and the deregulation of the gas supply has led to tremendous change in the energy markets. LDC customers can purchase gas directly from producers and marketers in an open, competitive market. This separation or “unbundling” of the transportation and other services offered by LDCs allows customers to purchase the commodity independent of services provided by LDCs. LDCs continue to purchase gas and recover the associated costs from their customers. Certain of our Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries are involved in programs that provide our residential and commercial customers the opportunity to purchase their natural gas requirements from third parties and use our Gas Distribution Operations’ subsidiaries for transportation services. As of December 31, 2021, 26.2% of our residential customers and 35.4% of our commercial customers participated in such programs.\nGas Distribution Operations competes with (i) investor-owned, municipal, and cooperative electric utilities throughout its service areas, (ii) other regulated and unregulated natural gas intra and interstate pipelines and (iii) other alternate fuels, such as propane and fuel oil. Gas Distribution Operations continues to be a strong competitor in the energy market as a result of strong customer preference for natural gas. Competition with providers of electricity has traditionally been the strongest in the residential and commercial markets of Kentucky, southern Ohio, central Pennsylvania and western Virginia due to comparatively low electric rates.\nElectric Competition\n. Indiana electric utilities generally have exclusive service areas under Indiana regulations, and retail electric customers in Indiana do not have the ability to choose their electric supplier.  NIPSCO faces non-utility competition from other energy sources, such as self-generation by large industrial customers and other distributed energy sources.\n7\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nSeasonality\nA significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating and cooling seasons,  revenues from gas and electric sales, respectively, are more significant than in other months. The heating season is primarily from November through March, and the cooling season is primarily from June through September.\nRate Case Actions\nThe following table describes current rate case actions as applicable in each of our jurisdictions net of tracker impacts. See \"Cost Recovery and Trackers\" below for further detail on trackers.\n(1)\nNo approved ROE is identified for this matter since the approved revenue increase is the result of a black box settlement under which parties agree upon the amount of increase without specifying ratemaking elements to establish the Company's revenue requirement. Pursuant to the settlement, for purposes of calculating its DSIC, Columbia of Pennsylvania shall use the equity return rate for gas utilities contained in the Pennsylvania Commission’s most recent Quarterly Report on the Earnings of Jurisdictional Utilities, including quarterly updates thereto.\n(2)\nThe approved ROE for natural gas capital riders (\ne.g\n.,SMRP) is 9.275%.\n(3)\nColumbia of Virginia's rate case resulted in a black box settlement, representing a settlement to a specific revenue increase but not a specified ROE. The settlement provides use of a 9.70% ROE for future SAVE filings.\n(4)\nProposed new rates would be implemented in 2 steps, with implementation of step 1 rates to be effective in September 2022 and step 2 rates to be effective in March 2023.\nCOVID-19 Regulatory Deferrals\nIn addition to the cost deferred to a regulatory asset as noted in Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, certain states have permitted us to track lost late and disconnect fee revenues due to the pandemic. While these costs do not qualify as regulatory assets under ASC 980, we will consider seeking recovery of these costs in future regulatory proceedings.\nCompetition and Changes in the Regulatory Environment\nThe regulatory frameworks applicable to our operations, including environmental regulations, at both the state and federal levels, continue to evolve. These changes have had and will continue to have an impact on our operations, structure and profitability. Management continually seeks new ways to be more competitive and profitable in this environment. We believe we are, in all material respects, in compliance with such laws and regulations and do not expect continued compliance to have a material impact on our capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. We continue to monitor existing and pending laws and regulations, and the impact of regulatory changes cannot be predicted with certainty. Refer to Note 19-E, \"Environmental Matters,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information regarding environmental regulations that are applicable to our operations.\nThe Gas Distribution Operations utilities have pursued non-traditional revenue sources within the evolving natural gas marketplace. These efforts include (i) the sale of products and services upstream of the companies’ service territory, (ii) the sale of products and services in the companies’ service territories, and (iii) gas supply cost incentive mechanisms for service to their\n8\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\ncore markets. The upstream products are made up of transactions that occur between an individual Gas Distribution Operations utility and a buyer for the sales of unbundled or rebundled gas supply and capacity. The on-system services are offered by us to customers and include products such as the transportation and balancing of gas on the Gas Distribution Operations utility's system. The incentive mechanisms give the Gas Distribution Operations utilities an opportunity to share in the savings created from such situations as gas purchase prices paid below an agreed upon benchmark and their ability to reduce pipeline capacity charges with their customers.\nWe recognize that energy efficiency reduces emissions, conserves natural resources and saves our customers money. Our gas distribution companies offers programs such as energy efficiency upgrades, home checkups and weatherization services. The increased efficiency of natural gas appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards contributes to a long-term trend of declining average use per customer.  While we are looking to expand offerings so the energy efficiency programs can benefit as many customers as possible, our Gas Distribution Operations have pursued changes in rate design to more effectively match recoveries with costs incurred. Columbia of Ohio has adopted a straight fixed variable rate design that closely links the recovery of fixed costs with fixed charges. Columbia of Maryland and Columbia of Virginia have regulatory approval for weather and revenue normalization adjustments for certain customer classes, which adjust monthly revenues that exceed or fall short of approved levels. Columbia of Pennsylvania continues to operate its pilot residential weather normalization adjustment and also has a fixed customer charge. This weather normalization adjustment only adjusts revenues when actual weather compared to normal varies by more than 3%. Columbia of Kentucky incorporates a weather normalization adjustment for certain customer classes and also has a fixed customer charge. In a prior gas base rate proceeding, NIPSCO implemented a higher fixed customer charge for residential and small customer classes moving toward recovering more of its fixed costs through a fixed recovery charge, but has no weather or usage protection mechanism.\nWhile increased efficiency of electric appliances and improvements in home building codes and standards has similarly impacted the average use per electric customer in recent years, NIPSCO expects future growth in per customer usage as a result of increasing electric applications. Further growth is anticipated as electric vehicles become more prevalent. These ongoing changes in use of electricity will likely lead to development of innovative rate designs, and NIPSCO will continue efforts to design rates that increase the certainty of recovery of fixed costs.\nCost Recovery and Trackers.\nComparability of our line item operating results is impacted by regulatory trackers that allow for the recovery in rates of certain costs such as those described below. Increases in the expenses that are subject to approved regulatory tracker mechanisms generally lead to increased regulatory assets, which ultimately result in a corresponding increase in operating revenues and, therefore, have essentially no impact on total operating income results. Certain approved regulatory tracker mechanisms allow for abbreviated regulatory proceedings in order for the operating companies to quickly implement revised rates and recover associated costs.\nA portion of the Gas Distribution revenue is related to the recovery of gas costs, the review and recovery of which occurs through standard regulatory proceedings. All states in our operating area require periodic review of actual gas procurement activity to determine prudence and confirm the recovery of prudently incurred energy commodity costs supplied to customers.\nA portion of the Electric Operations revenue is related to the recovery of fuel costs to generate power and the fuel costs related to purchased power. These costs are recovered through a FAC, which is updated quarterly to reflect actual costs incurred to supply electricity to customers.\nHuman Capital\nHuman Capital Management Governance and Organizational Practices\n. The Compensation and Human Capital Committee of our Board of Directors (the \"Board\") is primarily responsible for assisting the Board in overseeing our human capital management practices. In October 2021, the Board renamed the Compensation Committee the “Compensation and Human Capital Committee” and clarified the Committee’s responsibilities in its Charter to include reviewing our human capital management function and programs, including related procedures, programs, policies and practices, and to make recommendations to management with respect to equal employment opportunity and diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; employee engagement and corporate culture; and talent management. Our Board also reviews human capital management matters, including talent strategy, employee engagement and culture. Earlier in 2021, we hired a new Senior Vice President and Chief Human Resources Officer and a new Vice President and Chief Diversity Officer to lead these initiatives.\nIn addition to overseeing our human capital management practices, our Board is committed to ensuring that the Board is comprised of directors with diverse skills, expertise, experience and demographics, including racial and gender diversity. Women and people of color each comprise 30% of our Board.\n9\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nHuman Capital Goals and Objectives\n.\nWe have aligned our human capital goals to achieve overall company strategic and operational objectives by driving an enhanced talent strategy, elevating support for front-line leaders, fostering a culture of rigor and accountability and strengthening our human resources function as a whole.\nWorkforce Composition\n.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 7,272 full-time and 70 part-time employees. Thirty-six percent of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions and 32% of our employees were subject to collective bargaining agreements that are set to expire within one year. We are currently in the process of renegotiating these agreements.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\n.\nWe are committed to accelerating and embedding diversity, equity and inclusion throughout the enterprise to reflect the communities and customers we serve. Our talent acquisition teams hired 748 external candidates in 2021 across all business segments. Thirty-eight percent of external hires were female and 21% were racially or ethnically diverse. In 2021, we engaged with community-based organizations, conducted career interest workshops in local schools, and focused our employee mentorship program on females. We also led a separate targeted development program for select employees to support the growth and development of female and ethnically diverse talent. We offer several employee resource groups (“ERGs”) and host mostly virtual activities throughout each year. We have ERGs to support African-American, Hispanic, veterans, LGBTQ+, female and Asian employees, among others, and held several sponsored conversations between senior executives and the ERGs.\nIn order to provide additional transparency, we are enhancing our corporate website to include more information on our diversity, equity and inclusion program and plans, which are led by our Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer, with the full support of our Chief Human Resources Officer, executive leadership team, Compensation and Human Capital Committee and Board.  We plan to post consolidated EEO-1 report data on our website by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\nThe following graph shows the percentage of total employees represented by females and males overall and for our officers as of December 31, 2021:\n10\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nThe following graph shows the percentage of total employees represented by race/ethnicity overall and for our officers as of December 31, 2021:\nTalent Development and Retention\n.\nWe offer leadership development programs to enhance the behaviors and skills of our existing and future leaders. In 2021, we had participation from employees of all levels. We also offer extensive technical and non-technical employee development training programs.\nWe strive to provide promotion and advancement opportunities for employees. In 2021, 86% of all leadership positions at the supervisor and above level were filled internally. We develop and implement targeted development action plans to increase succession candidate readiness for leadership roles. We also monitor the risk and potential impact of talent loss and take action to increase retention of top talent.  Retention at NiSource in 2021 was over 89%. Retention is calculated using the total number of separations divided by the average headcount for the annual period. In addition to voluntary separations, separations include involuntary separation (2.0%), resignation (4.6%), and retirement (4.2%).\nTalent Attraction\n.\nTo recruit and hire individuals with a variety of skills, talents, backgrounds and experiences, we value and cultivate relationships with community and diversity outreach sources. We also target jobs fairs including those focused on people of color, veteran and women candidates and partner with local colleges and universities to identify and recruit qualified applicants in the communities we serve.\nSimilar to other companies that are adjusting in a COVID-19 environment, we are focused on our future of work and creating a more flexible, agile model for roles that can be performed in a more virtual setting. We anticipate expanding our recruiting footprint for certain roles that do not require to be in-person within our operating states.\nSuccession Planning\n.\nWe perform succession planning quarterly for officer-level and critical roles to ensure that we develop and sustain a strong bench of talent capable of performing at the highest levels. Not only is talent identified, but potential paths of development are discussed to ensure that employees have an opportunity to build their skills and are well-prepared for future roles. We maintain formal succession plans for our Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and key executive officers. The succession plan for our CEO is reviewed by the Nominating and Governance Committee and the succession plans for executive officers (other than the CEO) and critical roles are reviewed by the Compensation and Human Capital Committee annually or more frequently as needed.\nEmployee and Workplace Health and Safety\n.\nWe have a number of programs to support employees and their families’ physical, mental, and financial well-being.\nThese programs include a paid wellness day, telemedicine services, an Employee Assistance Program, Integrated Health Management navigation services, employee paid sick/disability leave and paid illness in\n11\nITEM 1. BUSINESS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nfamily days, competitive medical, dental, vision, life and long term disability programs including employee health savings account company contributions.\nWe also have a robust program to support employee, contractor and public safety, which is led by our Chief Safety Officer and is under the oversight of the Environmental, Safety and Sustainability Committee of our Board. We plan to publish a comprehensive safety report on our corporate website either before or in conjunction with our upcoming integrated annual report to provide additional transparency on our safety program. In response to COVID-19, we have implemented procedures designed to protect our employees who work in the field and who continue to work in operational and corporate facilities, including social distancing and wearing face coverings. We have also implemented work-from-home policies and practices. We are continuously evaluating changes to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (\"CDC\") guidance, and updating our safety measures accordingly, in order to ensure employee and customer safety during the pandemic. We are following federal, state, and local laws, regulations and guidelines related to the COVID-19 vaccinations. For more information regarding our response to the pandemic, see “Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Executive Summary” in this report.\nCulture and Engagement.\nOur culture is another important aspect of our ability to advance our strategic and operational objectives.  In addition to our diversity, equity and inclusion, recruiting, development and retention programs described above, we also invest in internal communications programs, including in-person and virtual learning and networking opportunities as well as regular executive communications to employees. Our executive leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer, communicates directly and regularly with all employees on timely ethics topics through electronic messages, coffee chats, management forums and all-employee town hall meetings. These communications emphasize the importance of our values and culture in the workplace. In addition, we offer in-person and virtual employee community service opportunities and we support employees’ personal volunteering and charitable giving through our charitable matching program.\nTo instill and reinforce our values and culture, we require our employees to participate in regular training on rotating ethics and compliance topics each year, including, among others, raising concerns, treating others with respect, preventing discrimination in the workplace, anti-bribery and corruption, data protection, unconscious biases, harassment, conflicts of interest, and the anonymous ethics and compliance hotline.  All employees receive training on our Code of Business Conduct biannually or more frequently if there is a material change in content. Our business ethics program, including the employee training program, is reviewed annually by our executive leadership team and the Audit Committee of our Board.\nWe measure and monitor culture and employee engagement through a variety of channels including pulse surveys and engagement surveys.  Our Compensation and Human Capital Committee reviews reports from our Chief Human Resources Officer and Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion Officer on employee engagement and corporate culture.  Our Board reviews results and action plans related to our enterprise-wide comprehensive employee engagement survey.\nOther Relevant Business Information\nOur customer base is broadly diversified, with no single customer accounting for a significant portion of revenues.\nFor a listing of material subsidiaries of NiSource refer to Exhibit 21.\nWe electronically file various reports with the SEC, including annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to such reports, as well as our proxy statements for the Company's annual meetings of stockholders at\nhttp://www.sec.gov\n.

Liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed environmental laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\n•\nChanges in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe may not be able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including utility infrastructure investments.\nBusiness or regulatory conditions may result in us not being able to execute our business plan or growth strategy, including identified, planned and other utility infrastructure investments, which includes investments related to natural gas pipeline modernization and investments related to our renewable energy projects and the build-transfer execution goals within our business plan. Our “NiSource Next” initiative, a comprehensive program designed to identify long-term sustainable capability enhancements and cost optimization improvements, has increased the volume and pace of change and may not be effective as it continues.  Our customer and regulatory initiatives may not achieve planned results. Utility infrastructure investments may not materialize, may cease to be achievable or economically viable and may not be successfully completed. Natural gas may cease to be viewed as an economically and environmentally attractive fuel. Certain environmental activist groups, investors and governmental entities continue to oppose natural gas delivery and infrastructure investments because of perceived environmental impacts associated with the natural gas supply chain and end use. Energy conservation, energy efficiency, distributed generation, energy storage, policies favoring electric heat over gas heat and other factors may reduce demand for natural gas and electricity.  In addition, we consider acquisitions or dispositions of assets or businesses, joint ventures and mergers from time to time as we execute on our business plan and growth strategy. Any of these circumstances could adversely affect our results of operations and growth prospects.  Even if our business plan and growth strategy are executed, there is still risk of, among other things, human error in maintenance, installation or operations, shortages or delays in obtaining equipment, and performance below expected levels (in addition to the other risks discussed in this section).  We are currently experiencing, and expect to continue to experience, supply chain challenges impacting our ability to obtain materials for our gas and electric projects.  Risks to our capital projects is described in a separate risk factor below.\n15\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nOur gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including potential public safety risks.\nOur gas distribution and transmission activities, as well as generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity, involve a variety of inherent hazards and operating risks, including, but not limited to, gas leaks and over-pressurization, downed power lines, stray electrical voltage, excavation or vehicular damage to our infrastructure, outages, environmental spills, mechanical problems and other incidents, which could cause substantial financial losses, as demonstrated in part by the Greater Lawrence Incident. We also have distribution propane assets that involve similar risks.  In addition, these hazards and risks have resulted and may in the future result in serious injury or loss of life to employees and/or the general public, significant damage to property, environmental pollution, impairment of our operations, adverse regulatory rulings and reputational harm, which in turn could lead to substantial losses for NiSource and its stockholders. The location of pipeline facilities, including regulator stations, liquefied natural gas and underground storage, or generation, transmission, substation and distribution facilities near populated areas, including residential areas, commercial business centers and industrial sites, could increase the level of damages resulting from such incidents. As with the Greater Lawrence Incident, certain incidents have subjected and may in the future subject us to litigation or administrative or other legal proceedings from time to time, both civil and criminal, which could result in substantial monetary judgments, fines, or penalties against us, be resolved on unfavorable terms, and require us to incur significant operational expenses. The occurrence of incidents has in certain instances adversely affected and could in the future adversely affect our reputation, cash flows, financial position and/or results of operations. We maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nFailure to adapt to advances in technology and manage the related costs could make us less competitive and negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nA key element of our electric business model includes generating power at central station power plants to achieve economies of scale and produce power at a competitive cost. We continue to research, plan for, and implement new technologies that produce reliable, cost-efficient power or reduce power consumption and improve the impact on the environment.  These technologies, many of which NiSource is implementing, include renewable energy, distributed generation, energy storage, and energy efficiency. Advances in technology, changes in laws or regulations (including subsidization) and other alternative methods of producing power could reduce the cost of electric generation from these sources to a level that is competitive with most central station power electric production, causing power sales to decline and the value of our generating facilities to decline. Other new technologies require us to make significant expenditures to remain competitive and may result in the obsolescence of certain operating assets.\nOur natural gas business model depends on widespread utilization of natural gas for space heating as a core driver of revenues.  Alternative energy sources, new technologies or alternatives to natural gas space heating, including cold climate heat pumps and/or efficiency of other products, could reduce demand and increase customer attrition, which would impact our ability to recover on our investments in our gas distribution assets.\nIn addition, customers are increasingly expecting additional communications, increased access to information, and expanded electronic capabilities regarding their electric and natural gas services, which, in some cases, involves additional investments in technology. We also rely on technology to adequately maintain key business records.\nOur future success will depend, in part, on our ability to anticipate and successfully adapt to technological changes, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, including environmental impacts associated with our products and services, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets. A failure by us to effectively adapt to changes in technology and manage the related costs could harm our ability to remain competitive in the marketplace for our products and services and could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAging infrastructure may lead to disruptions in operations and increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, all of which could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe have risks associated with aging electric and gas infrastructure. These risks can be driven by threats such as, but not limited to, electrical faults, mechanical failure, internal corrosion, external corrosion, ground movement and stress corrosion and/or cracking. The age of these assets may result in a need for replacement, a higher level of maintenance costs, or unscheduled outages, despite efforts by us to properly maintain or upgrade these assets through inspection, scheduled maintenance and capital investment. In addition, the nature of the information available on aging infrastructure assets, which in some cases is incomplete, may make the operation of the infrastructure, inspections, maintenance, upgrading and replacement of the assets particularly challenging. Missing or incorrect infrastructure data may lead to (1) difficulty properly locating facilities, which\n16\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\ncan result in excavator damage and operational or emergency response issues, and (2) configuration and control risks associated with the modification of system operating pressures in connection with turning off or turning on service to customers, which can result in unintended outages or operating pressures. Also, additional maintenance and inspections are required in some instances in order to improve infrastructure information and records and address emerging regulatory or risk management requirements, which increases our costs.\nSupply chain issues related to shortages of materials and transportation logistics may lead to delays in the maintenance and replacement of aging infrastructure, which could increase the probability and/or impact of a public safety incident. We lack diversity in suppliers of gas materials. We may not be effective in ensuring that we can obtain adequate emergency supply on a timely basis in each state, that no compromises are being made on quality and that we have alternate suppliers available. The failure to operate our assets as desired could result in interruption of electric service, major component failure at generating facilities and electric substations, gas leaks and other incidents, and an inability to meet firm service and compliance obligations, which could adversely impact revenues, and could also result in increased capital expenditures and maintenance costs, which, if not fully recovered from customers, could negatively impact our financial results.\nWe may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms or at all, and the insurance coverage we do obtain may not provide protection against all significant losses.\nOur ability to obtain insurance, as well as the cost and coverage of such insurance, are affected by developments affecting our business; international, national, state, or local events; and the financial condition and underwriting considerations of insurers.  For example, some insurers are moving away from underwriting certain carbon-intensive energy-related businesses such as those in the coal industry or those exposed to certain perils such as wildfires as well as gas explosion events or other infrastructure-related risks. The utility insurance market continues to be impacted by a prevalence of severe losses, and despite significant increases in rates over the past few years, markets are experiencing unacceptable loss ratios.  We have not been able to obtain liability insurance coverage at previously procured limits at rates that are acceptable to us.  Capacity limits insurers are willing to issue have decreased, requiring participation from more insurers to provide adequate coverage.  Insurance coverage may not continue to be available at limits, rates or terms acceptable to us.  The premiums we pay for our insurance coverage have significantly increased as a result of market conditions and the accumulated loss ratio over the history of our operations, and we do not expect those costs to decline.  In addition, our insurance is not sufficient or effective under all circumstances and against all hazards or liabilities to which we are subject. For example, total expenses related to the Greater Lawrence Incident exceeded the total amount of liability coverage available under our policies.  Certain types of damages, expenses or claimed costs, such as fines and penalties, have been and in the future may be excluded under the policies. In addition, insurers providing insurance to us may raise defenses to coverage under the terms and conditions of the respective insurance policies that could result in a denial of coverage or limit the amount of insurance proceeds available to us.  Any losses for which we are not fully insured or that are not covered by insurance at all could materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, and financial position.\nThe implementation of NIPSCO’s electric generation strategy, including the retirement of its coal generation units, may not achieve intended results.\nOur plan to replace our coal generation capacity by the end of 2028 with primarily renewable resources is well underway. We submitted an Integrated Resource Plan (the “Plan”) to the IURC, and our Preferred Energy Resource Plan, which refines the timeline to retire the Michigan City Generating Station to occur between 2026 and 2028. We submitted our 2021 Plan to the IURC in November 2021. The 2021 Plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the Sugar Creek Generating Station, among other steps. The precise timing of the retirement will be informed by regulatory and policy changes, our ability to maintain reliability of the system and our ability to secure replacement capacity. For additional information, see “Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,” in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nThere are inherent risks and uncertainties in executing the projects associated with the 2018 and 2021 plans both for what has been already executed and what capacity is still planned, including changes in market conditions, supply chain disruptions, regulatory approvals, environmental regulations, commodity costs and customer expectations, which may impede NIPSCO’s ability to achieve the intended results and associated timelines.  Changes in the cost, availability and supply of generation capacity may affect the implementation of the results from the 2021 Plan.  Advancements in technology in replacement resources may not become commercially available or economically feasible as projected in the 2021 Plan and the implementation execution may vary from that which has been communicated.  NIPSCO’s future success will depend, in part, on its ability to successfully implement its long-term electric generation plans, to offer services that meet customer demands and evolving industry standards, and to recover all, or a significant portion of, any unrecovered investment in obsolete assets.\n17\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNIPSCO’s electric generation strategy could require significant future capital expenditures, operating costs and charges to earnings that may negatively impact our financial position, financial results and cash flows. An inability to secure and deliver on renewable projects would negatively impact our generation transition timeline, achievement of decarbonization goals and reputation.\nOur capital projects and programs subject us to construction risks and natural gas costs and supply risks, and are subject to regulatory oversight, including requirements for permits, approvals and certificates from various governmental agencies.\nOur business requires substantial capital expenditures for investments in, among other things, capital improvements to our electric generating facilities, electric and natural gas distribution infrastructure, natural gas storage, and other projects, including projects for environmental compliance. We are engaged in intrastate natural gas pipeline modernization programs to maintain system integrity and enhance service reliability and flexibility.  NIPSCO also is currently engaged in a number of capital projects, including environmental improvements to its electric generating stations, the construction of new transmission and distribution facilities, and new projects related to renewable energy.  As we undertake these projects and programs, we may be unable to complete them on schedule or at the anticipated costs due in part to shortages in materials as described more fully below. Additionally, we may construct or purchase some of these projects and programs to capture anticipated future growth, which may not materialize, and may cause the construction to occur over an extended period of time.\nOur existing and planned capital projects require numerous permits, approvals and certificates from federal, state, and local governmental agencies. If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatory approvals or if we fail to obtain or maintain any required approvals or to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, we may not be able to construct or operate our facilities, we may be forced to incur additional costs, or we may be unable to recover any or all amounts invested in a project. We also may not receive the anticipated increases in revenue and cash flows resulting from such projects and programs until after their completion. Other construction risks include changes in the availability and costs of materials, equipment, commodities or labor (including changes to tariffs on materials), delays caused by construction incidents or injuries, work stoppages, shortages in qualified labor, poor initial cost estimates, unforeseen engineering issues, the ability to obtain necessary rights-of-way, easements and transmissions connections and general contractors and subcontractors not performing as required under their contracts.\nWe are monitoring risks related to increasing order and delivery lead times for construction and other materials, increasing risk associated with the unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials and issues with transportation logistics, and risk of decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials critical to our gas and electric operations. Our efforts to enhance our resiliency to supply chain shortages may not be effective. We are also seeing increasing prices associated with certain materials, equipment and products, which impacts our ability to complete major capital projects at the cost that was planned and approved. To the extent that delays occur or costs increase, customer affordability as well as our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. In addition, to the extent that delays occur on projects that target system integrity, the risk of an operational incident could increase. For more information on global availability of materials for our renewable projects, see \" - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations - Electric Supply and Generation Transition.\"\nTo the extent that delays occur, costs become unrecoverable or recovery is delayed, or we otherwise become unable to effectively manage and complete our capital projects, our results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition may be adversely affected.\nA significant portion of the gas and electricity we sell is used by residential and commercial customers for heating and air conditioning. Accordingly, fluctuations in weather, gas and electricity commodity costs, inflation and economic conditions impact demand of our customers and our operating results.\nEnergy sales are sensitive to variations in weather. Forecasts of energy sales are based on “normal” weather, which represents a long-term historical average. Significant variations from normal weather resulting from climate change or other factors could have, and have had, a material impact on energy sales. Additionally, residential usage, and to some degree commercial usage, is sensitive to fluctuations in commodity costs for gas and electricity, whereby usage declines with increased costs, thus affecting our financial results. Commodity prices have been increasing.  Rising gas costs could heighten regulator and stakeholder sensitivity relative to the impact of base rate increases on customer affordability.  Lastly, residential and commercial customers’ usage is sensitive to economic conditions and factors such as unemployment, consumption and consumer confidence.  Therefore, prevailing economic conditions affecting the demand of our customers may in turn affect our financial results.\n18\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nFluctuations in the price of energy commodities or their related transportation costs or an inability to obtain an adequate, reliable and cost-effective fuel supply to meet customer demands may have a negative impact on our financial results.\nOur current electric generating fleet is dependent on coal and natural gas for fuel, and our gas distribution operations purchase and resell a portion of the natural gas we deliver to our customers. These energy commodities are subject to price fluctuations and fluctuations in associated transportation costs. We use physical hedging through the use of storage assets and use financial products in certain jurisdictions in order to offset fluctuations in commodity supply prices. We rely on regulatory recovery mechanisms in the various jurisdictions in order to fully recover the commodity costs incurred in selling energy to our customers. However, while we have historically been successful in the recovery of costs related to such commodity prices, there can be no assurance that such costs will be fully recovered through rates in a timely manner.\nIn addition, we depend on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines, and other transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties to deliver the electricity and natural gas we sell to wholesale markets, supply natural gas to our gas storage and electric generation facilities, and provide retail energy services to our customers. If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, we may be unable to sell and deliver our gas and electric\nservices to some or all of our customers. As a result, we may be required to procure additional or alternative electricity and/or natural gas supplies at then-current market rates, which, if recovery of related costs is disallowed, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, financial condition, cash flows, results of operations and/or prospects.\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, and maintain good labor relations, could harm our results of operations.\nWe operate in an industry that requires many of our employees and contractors to possess unique technical skill sets.  An aging workforce without appropriate replacements, the mismatch of skill sets to future needs, the unavailability of talent for internal positions, and the unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges or increased costs. These operating challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge, and a lengthy time period associated with skill development. For example, certain skills, such as those related to construction, maintenance and repair of transmission and distribution systems are in high demand and have a limited supply. Current and prospective employees may determine that they do not wish to work for us due to market, economic, employment and other conditions, including those related to organizational changes as described in the risk factor below.\nWe face increased competition for talent in the current environment of sustained labor shortage and increased turnover rates. Additionally, any regulatory changes requiring us to enforce a COVID-19 vaccination mandate and how such a mandate is implemented could impact the availability of, and our ability to attract and retain, sufficient qualified employees. We are also facing increasing risk of worker illness and availability due to more contagious COVID-19 variants.  These or other employee workforce factors could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant portion of our workforce is subject to collective bargaining agreements, several of which are currently being renegotiated. Our collective bargaining agreements are generally negotiated on an operating company basis with some companies having multiple bargaining agreements, which may span different geographies.  Any failure to reach an agreement on new labor contracts or to renegotiate these labor contracts might result in strikes, boycotts or other labor disruptions. Our workforce continuity plans may not be effective in avoiding work stoppages that may result from labor negotiations or mass resignations. Labor disruptions, strikes or significant negotiated wage and benefit increases, whether due to union activities, employee turnover or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, results of operations and/or cash flows.\nOur strategic plan includes enhanced technology and transmission and distribution investments and a reduction in reliance on coal-fired generation. As part of our strategic plan, we will need to attract and retain personnel that are qualified to implement our strategy and may need to retrain or re-skill certain employees to support our long-term objectives.\nFailure to hire and retain qualified employees, including the ability to transfer significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to the new employees, may adversely affect our ability to manage and operate our business.  If we are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and maintain satisfactory collective bargaining agreements, safety, service reliability, customer satisfaction and our results of operations could be adversely affected.\n19\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nIf we cannot effectively manage new initiatives and organizational changes, we will be unable to address the opportunities and challenges presented by our strategy and the business and regulatory environment.\nIn order to execute on our sustainable growth strategy and enhance our culture of ongoing continuous improvement, we must effectively manage the complexity and frequency of new initiatives and organizational changes.  The organizational changes from the NiSource Next initiative have put short-term pressure on employees due to the volume and pace of change and, in some cases, loss of personnel.  Front-line workers are being impacted by the variety of process and technology changes that are currently in progress.\nIf we are unable to make decisions quickly, assess our opportunities and risks, and successfully implement new governance, managerial and organizational processes as needed to execute our strategy in this increasingly dynamic and competitive business and regulatory environment, our financial condition, results of operations and relationships with our business partners, regulators, customers, employees and stockholders may be negatively impacted.\nActions of activist stockholders could negatively affect our business and stock price and cause us to incur significant expenses\nWe may be subject to actions or proposals from activist stockholders or others that may not be aligned with our long-term strategy or the interests of our other stockholders. We have had communications with an activist stakeholder. Our response to suggested actions, proposals, director nominations and contests for the election of directors activist stockholders could disrupt our business and operations, divert the attention of our board of directors, management and employees, and be costly and time‐consuming. Potential actions by activist stockholders or others may interfere with our ability to execute our strategic plans; create perceived uncertainties as to the future direction of our business or strategy; cause uncertainty with our regulators; make it more difficult to attract and retain qualified personnel; and adversely affect our relationships with our existing and potential business partners. Any of the foregoing could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Also, we may be required to incur significant fees and other expenses related to responding to shareholder activism, including for third-party advisors. Moreover, our stock price could be subject to significant fluctuation or otherwise be adversely affected by the events, risks and uncertainties of any stockholder activism.\nWe outsource certain business functions to third-party suppliers and service providers, and substandard performance by those third parties could harm our business, reputation and results of operations.\nUtilities rely on extensive networks of business partners and suppliers to support critical enterprise capabilities across their organizations. Like other companies in the utilities industry, we are seeing slowing deliveries from suppliers and in some cases materials and labor shortages for capital projects. We outsource certain services to third parties in areas including construction services, information technology, materials, fleet, environmental, operational services, corporate and other areas. In addition to delays and unavailability at times, outsourcing of services to third parties could expose us to inferior service quality or substandard deliverables, which may result in non-compliance (including with applicable legal requirements and industry standards), interruption of service or accidents, or reputational harm, which could negatively impact our results of operations.  We do not have full visibility into our supply chain, which may impact our ability to serve customers in a safe, reliable and cost-effective manner.  These risks include the risk of operational failure, reputation damage, disruption due to new supply chain disruptions, exposure to significant commercial losses and fines, and poorly positioned and distressed suppliers. If we continue to see delayed deliveries and shortages or if any other difficulties in the operations of these third-party suppliers and service providers, including their systems, were to occur, they could adversely affect our results of operations, or adversely affect our ability to work with regulators, unions, customers or employees.\nA cyber-attack on any of our or certain third-party technology systems upon which we rely may adversely affect our ability to operate and could lead to a loss or misuse of confidential and proprietary information or potential liability.\nWe are reliant on technology to run our business, which is dependent upon financial and operational technology systems to process critical information necessary to conduct various elements of our business, including the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity; operation of our gas pipeline facilities; and the recording and reporting of commercial and financial transactions to regulators, investors and other stakeholders.  In addition to general information and cyber risks that all large corporations face (e.g., ransomware, malware, unauthorized access attempts, phishing attacks, malicious intent by insiders, third-party software vulnerabilities and inadvertent disclosure of sensitive information), the utility industry faces evolving and increasingly complex cybersecurity risks associated with protecting sensitive and confidential customer and employee information, electric grid infrastructure, and natural gas infrastructure. Deployment of new business technologies, along with maintaining legacy technology, represents a large-scale opportunity for attacks on our information systems and confidential customer and employee information, as well as on the integrity of the energy grid and the natural gas infrastructure. Increasing\n20\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nlarge-scale corporate attacks in conjunction with more sophisticated threats continue to challenge power and utility companies. Any failure of our technology systems, or those of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could materially disrupt our ability to operate our business and could result in a financial loss and possibly do harm to our reputation.\nAdditionally, our information systems experience ongoing, often sophisticated, cyber-attacks by a variety of sources, including foreign sources, with the apparent aim to breach our cyber-defenses. While we have implemented and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to protect our information technology, operational technology, and data systems from such attacks, our cybersecurity program does not prevent all breaches or cyberattack incidents. We have experienced an increase in the number of attempts by external parties to access our networks or our company data without authorization. We have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, cyber intrusions and attacks to our information systems and our operational technology. To our knowledge, none of these intrusions or attacks have resulted in a material cybersecurity intrusion or data breach. The risk of a disruption or breach of our operational technology, or the compromise of the data processed in connection with our operations, through cybersecurity breach or ransomware attack has increased as attempted attacks have advanced in sophistication and number around the world.  Technological complexities combined with advanced cyber-attack techniques, lack of cyber hygiene and human error can result in a cyber incident, such as a ransomware attack. Supplier non-compliance with cyber controls can also result in a cyber incident. Attacks can occur at any point in the supply chain or with any suppliers.\nIn addition, we collect and retain personally identifiable information of our customers, stockholders, and employees. Customers, stockholders, and employees expect that we will adequately protect their personal information. The regulatory environment surrounding information security and privacy is increasingly demanding.\nAlthough we attempt to maintain adequate defenses to these attacks and work through industry groups and trade associations to identify common threats and assess our countermeasures, a security breach of our information systems and/or operational technology, or a security breach of the information systems of our customers, suppliers or others with whom we do business, could (i) adversely impact our ability to safely and reliably deliver electricity and natural gas to our customers through our generation, transmission and distribution systems and potentially negatively impact our compliance with certain mandatory reliability and gas flow standards, (ii) subject us to reputational and other harm or liabilities associated with theft or inappropriate release of certain types of information such as system operating information or information, personal or otherwise, relating to our customers or employees, (iii) impact our ability to manage our businesses, and/or (iv) subject us to legal and regulatory proceedings and claims from third parties, in addition to remediation costs, any of which, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on our businesses, cash flows, financial condition, results of operations and/or prospects. Although we do maintain cyber insurance, it is possible that such insurance will not adequately cover any losses or liabilities we may incur as a result of a cybersecurity incident.\nCompliance with and changes in cybersecurity requirements have a cost and operational impact on our business, and failure to comply with such laws and regulations could adversely impact our reputation, results of operations, financial condition and/or cash flows.\nAs cyberattacks are becoming more sophisticated, U.S. government warnings have indicated that critical infrastructure assets, including pipelines and electric infrastructure, may be specifically targeted by certain groups. In 2021, the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”) announced two new security directives in response to a ransomware attack on the Colonial Pipeline that occurred earlier in the year. These directives require critical pipeline owners to comply with mandatory reporting measures, designate a cybersecurity coordinator, provide vulnerability assessments, and ensure compliance with certain cybersecurity requirements. Such directives or other requirements may require expenditure of significant additional resources to respond to cyberattacks, to continue to modify or enhance protective measures, or to assess, investigate and remediate any critical infrastructure security vulnerabilities. Any failure to comply with such government regulations or failure in our cybersecurity protective measures may result in enforcement actions that may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, there is no certainty that costs incurred related to securing against threats will be recovered through rates.\nWe are exposed to significant reputational risks, which make us vulnerable to a loss of cost recovery, increased litigation and negative public perception.\nAs a utility company, we are subject to adverse publicity focused on the reliability of our services, the speed with which we are able to respond effectively to electric outages, natural gas leaks or events and related accidents and similar interruptions caused by storm damage, physical or cyber security incidents, or other unanticipated events, as well as our own or third parties' actions or failure to act.  We are subject to prevailing labor markets and high attrition, which may impact the speed of our customer service response. We are also facing supply chain challenges, the impacts of which may adversely impact our reputation in\n21\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nseveral areas as described elsewhere in these risk factors. We are also subject to adverse publicity related to actual or perceived environmental impacts. If customers, legislators, or regulators have or develop a negative opinion of us, this could result in less favorable legislative and regulatory outcomes or increased regulatory oversight, increased litigation and negative public perception. The adverse publicity and investigations we experienced as a result of the Greater Lawrence Incident may have an ongoing negative impact on the public’s perception of us.  It is difficult to predict the ultimate impact of this adverse publicity. The foregoing may have continuing adverse effects on our business, results of operations, cash flow and financial condition.\nWe have continued financial liabilities related to the sale of the Massachusetts Business.\nOn October 9, 2020, we completed the sale of the Massachusetts Business to Eversource. The sale of the Massachusetts Business involves separation or carve-out activities and costs and possible disputes with Eversource. We have continued financial liabilities with respect to the business conducted by Columbia of Massachusetts, as we retain responsibility for, and have agreed to indemnify Eversource against, certain liabilities. This responsibility includes liabilities for any fines arising out of the Greater Lawrence Incident and liabilities of Columbia of Massachusetts or its affiliates pursuant to civil claims for injury of persons or damage to property to the extent such injury or damage occurred prior to the closing in connection with the Massachusetts Business. It may also be difficult to determine whether a claim from a third party is our responsibility, and we may expend substantial resources trying to determine whether we or Eversource has responsibility for the claim.\nThe impacts of natural disasters, acts of terrorism, acts of war, civil unrest, cyber-attacks, accidents, public health emergencies or other catastrophic events may disrupt operations and reduce the ability to service customers.\nA disruption or failure of natural gas distribution systems, or within electric generation, transmission or distribution systems, in the event of a major hurricane, tornado, terrorist attack, acts of war, civil unrest, cyber-attack (as further detailed above), accident, public health emergency, pandemic, or other catastrophic event could cause delays in completing sales, providing services, or performing other critical functions. We have experienced disruptions in the past from hurricanes and tornadoes and other events of this nature. Also, companies in our industry face a heightened risk of exposure to acts of terrorism and vandalism. Our electric and gas physical infrastructure may be targets of physical security threats or terrorist activities that could disrupt our operations. We have increased security given the current environment and may be required by regulators or by the future threat environment to make investments in security that we cannot currently predict. In addition, the supply chain constraints that we are experiencing could impact timely restoration of services.  The occurrence of such events could adversely affect our financial position and results of operations.  In accordance with customary industry practice, we maintain insurance against some, but not all, of these risks and losses.\nThe physical impacts of climate change and the transition to a lower carbon future are impacting our business.\nClimate change is exacerbating the risks to our physical infrastructure by increasing the frequency of extreme weather, including heat stresses to power lines and storms and floods that damage infrastructure. In addition, climate change is likely to cause lake and river level changes that affect the manner in which services are currently provided and droughts or other stresses on water used to supply services, and other extreme weather conditions. We have adapted and will continue to evolve our infrastructure and operations to meet current and future needs of our stakeholders. With higher frequency of these and possibly other extreme weather events it may become more costly for us to safely and reliably deliver certain products and services to our customers. Some of these costs may not be recovered.  To the extent that we are unable to recover those costs, or if higher rates resulting from recovery of such costs result in reduced demand for services, our future financial results may be adversely impacted. Further, as the intensity and frequency of significant weather events increases, it may impact our ability to secure cost-efficient insurance as described above.\nOur strategy may be impacted by policy and legal, technology, market, and reputational risks and opportunities that are associated with the transition to a lower-carbon economy, as disclosed in other risk factors in this section.  As a result of increased awareness regarding climate change, coupled with adverse economic conditions, availability of alternative energy sources, including private solar, microturbines, fuel cells, energy-efficient buildings and energy storage devices, and new regulations restricting emissions, including potential regulations of methane emissions, some consumers and companies may use less energy, meet their own energy needs through alternative energy sources or avoid expansions of their facilities, including natural gas facilities, resulting in less demand for our services. As these technologies become a more cost-competitive option over time, whether through cost effectiveness or government incentives and subsidies, certain customers may choose to meet their own energy needs and subsequently decrease usage of our systems and services, which may result in, among other things, our generating facilities becoming less competitive and economical. Further, evolving investor sentiment related to the use of fossil fuels and initiatives to restrict continued production of fossil fuels could result in a significant impact on our electric generation and natural gas businesses in the future. Conversely, demand for our services may increase as a result of\n22\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\ncustomer changes in response to climate change. For example, as the utilization of electric vehicles increases, demand for electricity may increase, resulting in increased usage of our systems and services. Any negative opinions with respect to our environmental practices or our ability to meet the challenges posed by climate change formed by regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation and change the perceived value of our products and services.\nChanges in policy to combat climate change, and technology advancement, each of which can also accelerate the implications of a transition to a lower carbon economy, may materially adversely impact our business, financial position, results of operations, and cash flows\n.\nWe are subject to operational and financial risks and liabilities associated with the implementation and efforts to achieve our carbon emission reduction goals.\nNIPSCO’s electric generation transition is a key element of our goal to achieve a 90% reduction in our Scope 1 GHG emissions by 2030 compared with 2005 levels. Our analysis and plan for execution, which is outlined in the NIPSCO 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, requires us to make a number of assumptions. These goals and underlying assumptions involve risks and uncertainties and are not guarantees. Should one or more of our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, our actual results and ability to achieve our emissions goal could differ materially from our expectations. Certain of the assumptions that could impact our ability to meet our emissions goal include, but are not limited to: the accuracy of current emission measurements, service territory size and capacity needs remaining in line with expectations; regulatory approval; impacts of future environmental regulations or legislation; impact of future GHG pricing regulations or legislation, including a future carbon tax or methane fee; price, availability and regulation of carbon offsets; price of fuel, such as natural gas; cost of energy generation technologies, such as wind and solar, natural gas and storage solutions; adoption of alternative energy by the public, including adoption of electric vehicles; rate of technology innovation with regards to alternative energy resources; our ability to implement our modernization plans for our pipelines and facilities; the ability to complete and implement generation alternatives to NIPSCO’s coal generation and retirement dates of NIPSCO’s coal facilities by 2030; the ability to construct and/or permit new natural gas pipelines; the ability to procure resources needed to build at a reasonable cost, the lack of scarcity of resources and labor, project cancellations, construction delays or overruns and the ability to appropriately estimate costs of new generation; impact of any supply chain disruptions; and enhancement of energy efficiencies. Any negative opinions with respect to these goals or our environmental practices, including any inability to achieve, or a scaling back of these goals, formed by regulators, customers, investors or legislators could harm our reputation and have an adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFINANCIAL, ECONOMIC AND MARKET RISKS\nWe have substantial indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur business is capital intensive and we rely significantly on long-term debt to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. We had total consolidated indebtedness of $9,801.5 million outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Our substantial indebtedness could have important consequences. For example, it could:\n•\nlimit our ability to borrow additional funds or increase the cost of borrowing additional funds;\n•\nreduce the availability of cash flow from operations to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes;\n•\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in the business and the industries in which we operate;\n•\nlead parties with whom we do business to require additional credit support, such as letters of credit, in order for us to transact such business;\n•\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that are less leveraged;\n•\nincrease vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions; and\n•\nlimit our ability to execute on our growth strategy, which is dependent upon access to capital to fund our substantial infrastructure investment program.\nSome of our debt obligations contain financial covenants related to debt-to-capital ratios and cross-default provisions. Our failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in an event of default, which, if not cured or waived, could result in the acceleration of outstanding debt obligations.\nA drop in our credit ratings could adversely impact our cash flows, results of operation, financial condition and liquidity.\n23\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nThe availability and cost of credit for our businesses may be greatly affected by credit ratings. The credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure, earnings profile, and, in 2020 and 2021, the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings; however, there is no assurance we will be able to do so in the future.  Our credit ratings could be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant.  Any negative rating action could adversely affect our ability to access capital at rates and on terms that are attractive.  A negative rating action could also adversely impact our business relationships with suppliers and operating partners, who may be less willing to extend credit or offer us similarly favorable terms as secured in the past under such circumstances.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral in the form of cash, a letter of credit or other forms of security for new and existing transactions if our credit ratings (including the standalone credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries) are dropped below investment grade.  These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of gas or power.  As of December 31, 2021, the collateral requirement that would be required in the event of a downgrade below the ratings trigger levels would amount to approximately $56.2 million. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.\nIf our or certain of our subsidiaries' credit ratings were downgraded, especially below investment grade, financing costs and the principal amount of borrowings would likely increase due to the additional risk of our debt and because certain counterparties may require additional credit support as described above. Such amounts may be material and could adversely affect our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition. Losing investment grade credit ratings may also result in more restrictive covenants and reduced flexibility on repayment terms in debt issuances, lower share price and greater stockholder dilution from common equity issuances, in addition to reputational damage within the investment community.\nThe global outbreak of the novel coronavirus and its variants (COVID-19) has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, extended disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, and reduced labor availability and productivity. We continue to monitor how COVID-19 is affecting our workforce, customers, suppliers, operations, financial results and cash flow. The extent of the impact in the future will vary and depend on the duration and severity of the impact on the global, national and local economies.\nOur future operating results and liquidity may continue to be impacted by the pandemic, but the extent of the impact remains uncertain. Primarily in 2020, we experienced lower revenues, higher expenses for personal protective equipment and supplies, and higher bad debt expense as a consequence of the pandemic, which negatively impacted our results of operations. Although our revenues were higher in 2021 compared to 2020, we may continue to experience ongoing impact of the pandemic, which includes, but is not limited to:\n•\nLower revenue and cash flow, resulting from the decrease in commercial and industrial gas and electric demand as businesses comply with operating restrictions and/or businesses experience negative economic impact from the pandemic, potentially offset by higher residential demand;\n•\nLower revenue and cash flow in the event of the suspension of late payment and reconnection fees in some jurisdictions;\n•\nA decline in revenue due to an increase in customer attrition rates, as well as lower revenue growth if customer additions slow due to a prolonged economic downturn;\n•\nA continued increase in bad debt and a decrease in cash flows resulting from the suspension of shut-offs and the inability of our customers to pay for their gas and electric service due to job loss or other factors, partially offset by regulatory deferrals;\n•\nLower revenues on a prolonged basis resulting from higher customer bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through any broader economic downturn;\n•\nA continued delay in cash flows as more customers utilize the more flexible payment plans we offer; and\n•\nAn increase in internal labor costs from higher overtime.\nWe also face the risk of not achieving operational compliance and/or customer requirements because of work restrictions or unavailable employees due to the pandemic.  For more information regarding the items above and additional items related to the pandemic that we are evaluating and monitoring, please see our discussion of these topics in Part II., Item 7. \"Management\n24\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nDiscussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Executive Summary - Introduction - COVID-19\" in this report and in our future filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. To the extent the pandemic adversely affects our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other Risk Factors described herein.\nThe duration and ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition, including liquidity, capital and financing resources, will depend on numerous evolving factors and future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. Such factors and developments may include the geographic spread, severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, including whether there are periods of increased COVID-19 cases; the further spread of the Delta variant, Omicron variant or the emergence of other new or more contagious variants that may render vaccines ineffective or less effective; disruption to our operations resulting from employee illnesses or any inability to attract, retain or motivate employees; the development, availability and administration of effective treatment or vaccines and the willingness of individuals to receive a vaccine or otherwise comply with various mandates; the extent and duration of the impact on the U.S. or global economy, including the pace and extent of recovery when the COVID-19 pandemic subsides; and the actions that have been or may be taken by various governmental authorities in response to the outbreak.\nAdverse economic and market conditions, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in interest rates or changes in investor sentiment could materially and adversely affect our business, results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\nDeteriorating, sluggish or volatile economic conditions in our operating jurisdictions could adversely impact our ability to maintain or grow our customer base and collect revenues from customers, which could reduce our revenue or growth rate and increase operating costs. The continued spread of COVID-19 has resulted in widespread impacts on the global economy and financial markets and could lead to a prolonged reduction in economic activity, disruptions to supply chains and capital markets, and reduced labor availability and productivity.\nIn connection with the pandemic, certain state regulatory commissions instituted disconnection moratoriums and the suspension of collection of late payment fees, deposits and reconnection fees, which impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices. Following the issuance of these moratoriums, certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to record a regulatory asset for bad debt expense above levels currently in rates. We have reinstated our common credit mitigation practices as moratoriums have expired, but it is possible that such moratoriums will be reinstated as the pandemic continues.\nIn addition, the pandemic has impacted our physical business operations, resulting in delays in conducting certain residential work and additional costs required to comply with pandemic-related health and safety protocols.\nFurther, we rely on access to the capital markets to finance our liquidity and long-term capital requirements, including expenditures for our utility infrastructure and to comply with future regulatory requirements, to the extent not satisfied by the cash flow generated by our operations. We have historically relied on long-term debt and on the issuance of equity securities to fund a portion of our capital expenditures and repay outstanding debt, and on short-term borrowings to fund a portion of day-to-day business operations. Successful implementation of our long-term business strategies, including capital investment, is dependent upon our ability to access the capital and credit markets, including the banking and commercial paper markets, on competitive terms and rates. An economic downturn or uncertainty, market turmoil, changes in interest rates, changes in tax policy, challenges faced by financial institutions, changes in our credit ratings, or a change in investor sentiment toward us or the utilities industry generally could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital or refinance debt. For example, because NIPSCO’s current generating facilities substantially rely on coal for its operations, certain financial institutions may choose not to participate in our financing arrangements.  In addition, large institutional investors may choose to sell or choose not to purchase our stock due to environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) concerns or concerns regarding renewable energy supply chain challenges.  Reduced access to capital markets, increased borrowing costs, and/or lower equity valuation levels could reduce future earnings per share and cash flows.  Refer to Note 15, “Long-Term Debt,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to outstanding long-term debt and maturities of that debt. In addition, any rise in interest rates may lead to higher borrowing costs, which may adversely impact reported earnings, cost of capital and capital holdings.\nIf, in the future, we face limits to the credit and capital markets or experience significant increases in the cost of capital or are unable to access the capital markets, it could limit our ability to implement, or increase the costs of implementing, our business plan, which, in turn, could materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity.\n25\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nMost of our revenues are subject to economic regulation and are exposed to the impact of regulatory rate reviews and proceedings.\nMost of our revenues are subject to economic regulation at either the federal or state level. As such, the revenues generated by us are subject to regulatory review by the applicable federal or state authority. These rate reviews determine the rates charged to customers and directly impact revenues. Our financial results are dependent on frequent regulatory proceedings in order to ensure timely recovery of costs and investments. As described in more detail in the risk factor below, the outcomes of these proceedings are uncertain, potentially lengthy and could be influenced by many factors, some of which may be outside of our control, including the cost of providing service, the necessity of expenditures, the quality of service, regulatory interpretations, customer intervention, economic conditions and the political environment.  Further, the rate orders are subject to appeal, which creates additional uncertainty as to the rates that will ultimately be allowed to be charged for services.\nThe actions of regulators and legislators could result in outcomes that may adversely affect our earnings and liquidity.\nThe rates that our electric and natural gas companies charge their customers are determined by their state regulatory commissions and by the FERC. These commissions also regulate the companies' accounting, operations, the issuance of certain securities and certain other matters. The FERC also regulates the transmission of electric energy, the sale of electric energy at wholesale, accounting, issuance of certain securities and certain other matters, including reliability standards through the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC).\nUnder state and federal law, our electric and natural gas companies are entitled to charge rates that are sufficient to allow them an opportunity to recover their prudently incurred operating and capital costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested capital, to attract needed capital and maintain their financial integrity, while also protecting relevant public interests. Our electric and natural gas companies are required to engage in regulatory approval proceedings as a part of the process of establishing the terms and rates for their respective services. Each of these companies prepares and submits periodic rate filings with their respective regulatory commissions for review and approval, which allows for various entities to challenge our current or future rates, structures or mechanisms and could alter or limit the rates we are allowed to charge our customers. These proceedings typically involve multiple parties, including governmental bodies and officials, consumer advocacy groups, and various consumers of energy, who have differing concerns. Any change in rates, including changes in allowed rate of return, are subject to regulatory approval proceedings that can be contentious, lengthy, and subject to appeal. This may lead to uncertainty as to the ultimate result of those proceedings. Established rates are also subject to subsequent prudency reviews by state regulators, whereby various portions of rates could be adjusted, subject to refund or disallowed, including cost recovery mechanisms. The ultimate outcome and timing of regulatory rate proceedings could have a significant effect on our ability to recover costs or earn an adequate return. Adverse decisions in our proceedings could adversely affect our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nThere can be no assurance that regulators will approve the recovery of all costs incurred by our electric and natural gas companies, including costs for construction, operation and maintenance, and compliance with current and future changes in environmental, federal pipeline safety, critical infrastructure and cyber security laws and regulations. Challenges arise with state regulators on inflationary pricing for electric and gas materials and potential price increases, ensuring that updated pricing for electric and gas materials is included in plans and regulatory assumptions, and ensuring there is a regulatory recovery model for emergency inventory stock. There is debate among state regulators and other stakeholders over how to transition to a decarbonized economy and prudency arguments relative to investing in natural gas assets when the depreciable life of the assets may be shortened due to electrification. The inability to recover a significant amount of operating costs could have an adverse effect on a company’s financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nChanges to rates may occur at times different from when costs are incurred. Additionally, catastrophic events at other utilities could result in our regulators and legislators imposing additional requirements that may lead to additional costs for the companies.\nIn addition to the risk of disallowance of incurred costs, regulators may also impose downward adjustments in a company’s allowed ROE as well as assess penalties and fines. Regulators may reduce ROE to mitigate potential customer bill increases due to items unrelated to capital investments such as potential increases in taxes and incremental costs related to COVID-19. These actions would have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur electric business is subject to mandatory reliability and critical infrastructure protection standards established by NERC and enforced by the FERC. The critical infrastructure protection standards focus on controlling access to critical physical and cybersecurity assets. Compliance with the mandatory reliability standards could subject our electric utilities to higher operating costs. In addition, compliance with PHMSA regulations could subject our gas utilities to higher operating costs.  If our\n26\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nbusinesses are found to be in noncompliance, we could be subject to sanctions, including substantial monetary penalties, or damage to our reputation.\nChanges in tax laws, as well as the potential tax effects of business decisions, could negatively impact our business, results of operations (including our expected project returns from our planned renewable energy projects), financial condition and cash flows.\nOur business operations are subject to economic conditions in certain industries.\nBusiness operations throughout our service territories have been and may continue to be adversely affected by economic events at the national and local level where our businesses operate. In particular, sales to large industrial customers, such as those in the steel, oil refining, industrial gas and related industries, are impacted by economic downturns, including the downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic; geographic or technological shifts in production or production methods; and consumer demand for environmentally friendly products and practices. The U.S. manufacturing industry continues to adjust to changing market conditions including international competition, inflation and increasing costs, and fluctuating demand for its products. In addition, our results of operations are negatively impacted by lower revenues resulting from higher bankruptcies, predominately focused on commercial and industrial customers not able to sustain operations through the economic disruptions related to the pandemic.\nWe are exposed to risk that customers will not remit payment for delivered energy or services, and that suppliers or counterparties will not perform under various financial or operating agreements.\nOur extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy, involves considerable judgment by our employees and is based on an evaluation of a customer or counterparty’s financial condition, credit history and other factors. We monitor our credit risk exposure\nby obtaining credit reports and updated financial information for customers and suppliers, and by evaluating the financial status of our banking partners and other counterparties by reference to market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and to traditional credit ratings provided by the major credit rating agencies. Adverse economic conditions result in an increase in defaults by customers, suppliers and counterparties. As stated above, in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, state regulatory moratoriums, which have now expired, impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices.\nWe are a holding company and are dependent on cash generated by our subsidiaries to meet our debt obligations and pay dividends on our stock.\nWe are a holding company and conduct our operations primarily through our subsidiaries, which are separate and distinct legal entities. Substantially all of our consolidated assets are held by our subsidiaries. Accordingly, our ability to meet our debt obligations or pay dividends on our common stock and preferred stock is largely dependent upon cash generated by these subsidiaries. In the event a major subsidiary is not able to pay dividends or transfer cash flows to us, our ability to service our debt obligations or pay dividends could be negatively affected.\nThe trading prices for our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and related treasury units and Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock, are expected to be affected by, among other things, the trading prices of our common stock, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality.\nThe trading prices of the Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, which are listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and the related treasury units and Series C mandatory convertible preferred stock in the secondary market, are expected to be affected by, among other things, the trading prices of our common stock, the general level of interest rates and our credit quality. It is impossible to predict whether the price of our common stock or interest rates will rise or fall. The price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in the future in response to many events or factors, including those discussed in the risk factors herein, many of which events and factors are beyond our control. Fluctuations in interest rates may give rise to arbitrage opportunities based upon changes in the relative value of the common stock underlying the purchase contracts and of the other components of the Equity Units. Any such arbitrage could, in turn, affect the trading prices of the Corporate Units, treasury units, mandatory convertible preferred stock and our common stock.\nThe early settlement right triggered under certain circumstances and the supermajority rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock following a fundamental change, could discourage a potential acquirer.\nThe fundamental change early settlement right with respect to the purchase contracts triggered under certain circumstances by a fundamental change and the supermajority voting rights of the mandatory convertible preferred stock in connection with certain\n27\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nfundamental change transactions jointly could discourage a potential acquirer, including potential acquirers that would otherwise seek a transaction with us that would be attractive to our investors.\nOur Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and related mandatory convertible preferred stock, and the issuance and sale of common stock in settlement of the purchase contracts and conversion of mandatory convertible preferred stock, may all adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders.\nThe market price of our common stock is likely to be influenced by our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and related mandatory convertible preferred stock. For example, the market price of our common stock could become more volatile and could be depressed by:\n•\ninvestors’ anticipation of the sale into the market of a substantial number of additional shares of our common stock issued upon settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of our mandatory convertible preferred stock;\n•\npossible sales of our common stock by investors who view our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, or related mandatory convertible preferred stock as a more attractive means of equity participation in us than owning shares of our common stock; and\n•\nhedging or arbitrage trading activity that may develop involving our Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, or related mandatory convertible preferred stock and our common stock.\nIn addition, we cannot predict the effect that future issuances or sales of our common stock, if any, including those made upon the settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, may have on the market price for our common stock.\nOur Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, and the issuance and sale of substantial amounts of common stock, including issuances and sales upon the settlement of the purchase contracts or conversion of the mandatory convertible preferred stock, could adversely affect the market price of our common stock and will cause dilution to our stockholders.\nCapital market performance and other factors may decrease the value of benefit plan assets, which then could require significant additional funding and impact earnings.\nThe performance of the capital markets affects the value of the assets that are held in trust to satisfy future obligations under defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. We have significant obligations in these areas and hold significant assets in these trusts as noted in Note 12, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and may yield uncertain returns, which fall below our projected rates of return. A decline in the market value of assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations under the defined benefit pension plan. Additionally, changes in interest rates affect the liabilities under these benefit plans; as interest rates decrease, the liabilities increase, which could potentially increase funding requirements. Further, the funding requirements of the obligations related to these benefits plans may increase due to changes in governmental regulations and participant demographics, including increased numbers of retirements or longer life expectancy assumptions, as well as voluntary early retirements. In addition, lower asset returns result in increased expenses. Ultimately, significant funding requirements and increased pension or other postretirement benefit plan expense could negatively impact our results of operations and financial position.\nWe have significant goodwill. Any future impairments of goodwill could result in a significant charge to earnings in a future period and negatively impact our compliance with certain covenants under financing agreements.\nIn accordance with GAAP, we test goodwill for impairment at least annually and review our definite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate its fair value might be below its carrying value. Goodwill is also tested for impairment when factors, examples of which include reduced cash flow estimates, a sustained decline in stock price or market capitalization below book value, indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.\nA significant charge in the future could impact the capitalization ratio covenant under certain financing agreements. We are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility, which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2021, the ratio was\n57.4\n%.\n28\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nChanges in the method for determining LIBOR and the potential replacement of the LIBOR benchmark interest rate could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nSome of our indebtedness bears interest at a variable rate based on LIBOR. From time to time, we also enter into hedging instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the LIBOR benchmark interest rate. In addition, these hedging instruments, as well as hedging instruments that our subsidiaries use for hedging natural gas price and basis risk, rely on LIBOR-based rates to calculate interest accrued on certain payments that may be required to be made under these agreements, such as late payments or interest accrued if any cash collateral should be held by a counterparty. Any changes announced by regulators in the method pursuant to which the LIBOR rates are determined may result in a sudden or prolonged increase or decrease in the reported LIBOR rates. If that were to occur, the level of interest payments we incur may change.\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), which regulates LIBOR, announced that the FCA intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. In November 2020, the Board of Governors of the U.S. Federal Reserve System, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Office of the U.S. Comptroller of the Currency collectively issued a statement encouraging banks to stop entering into financial contracts that use LIBOR as a reference rate as soon as possible, and no later than December 31, 2021. In March 2021, the FCA announced that 1-week and 2‑month U.S. Dollar (“USD”) LIBOR will cease publication after December 31, 2021, and that the remaining USD LIBOR tenors will cease publication after June 30, 2023. It is not possible to predict the effect of these changes, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates in the United Kingdom or elsewhere. In the United States, efforts to identify a set of alternative U.S. dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee has proposed the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as its recommended alternative to LIBOR, and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York began publishing SOFR rates in April 2018. On February 18, 2022, we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit agreement which, among other things, amended the interest rate provisions applicable to borrowings under this agreement to utilize SOFR as the reference rate, rather than LIBOR. SOFR is intended to be a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight that is collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities.  However, because SOFR is a broad U.S. Treasury repurchase agreement financing rate that represents overnight secured funding transactions, it differs fundamentally from LIBOR. Because of these and other differences, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for LIBOR.\nIn addition, although certain of our LIBOR based obligations provide for alternative methods of calculating the interest rate payable on certain of our obligations if LIBOR is not reported, uncertainty as to the extent and manner of future changes may result in interest rates and/or payments that are higher than, lower than or that do not otherwise correlate over time with, the interest rates or payments that would have been made on our obligations if a LIBOR-based rate was available in its current form.\nLITIGATION, REGULATORY AND LEGISLATIVE RISKS\nThe outcome of legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation related to our business operations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nWe are\ninvolved in legal and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries, claims and litigation in connection with our business operations, including those related to the Greater Lawrence Incident, the most significant of which are summarized in Note 19, “Other Commitments and Contingencies,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. Our insurance does not cover all costs and expenses that we have incurred relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, and may not fully cover incidents that could occur in the future. Due to the inherent uncertainty of the outcomes of such matters, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim or proceeding would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity.\nThe Greater Lawrence Incident has materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident, we have incurred and will incur various costs and expenses.  While we have recovered the full amount of our liability insurance coverage available under our policies, total expenses related to the incident exceeded such amount. Expenses in excess of our liability insurance coverage have materially adversely affected and may continue to materially adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position. We may also incur additional costs associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident, beyond the amount currently anticipated, including in connection with civil litigation. Further, state or federal legislation may be enacted that would require us to incur additional costs by mandating various changes, including changes to our operating practice standards for natural gas distribution operations and safety. In\n29\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\naddition, if it is determined in other matters that we did not comply with applicable statutes, regulations or rules in connection with the operations or maintenance of our natural gas system, and we are ordered to pay additional amounts in penalties, or other amounts, our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur settlement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office in respect of federal charges in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident may expose us to further penalties, liabilities and private litigation, and may impact our operations.\nOn February 26, 2020, the Company entered into a DPA and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into a plea agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, which was subsequently approved by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the \"Court\").  The agreements impose various compliance and remedial obligations on the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts.  Failure to comply with the terms of these agreements could result in further enforcement action by the U.S. Attorney’s Office, expose the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts to penalties, financial or otherwise, and subject the Company to further private litigation, each of which could impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business.\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, tariffs and policies. We could be materially adversely affected if we fail to comply with such laws, regulations, tariffs and policies or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations, tariffs and policies.\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws, regulations, tariffs and policies, including, but not limited to, those relating to natural gas pipeline safety, employee safety, the environment and our energy infrastructure. In particular, we are subject to significant federal, state and local regulations applicable to utility companies, including regulations by the various utility commissions in the states where we serve customers. These regulations significantly influence our operating environment, may affect our ability to recover costs from utility customers, and cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs. Existing laws, regulations, tariffs and policies may be revised or become subject to new interpretations, and new laws, regulations, tariffs and policies may be adopted or become applicable to us and our operations. In some cases, compliance with new laws, regulations, tariffs and policies increases our costs. Supply chain constraints may challenge our ability to remain in compliance if we cannot obtain the materials that we need to operate our business in a compliant manner. If we fail to comply with laws, regulations and tariffs applicable to us or with any changes in or new interpretations of such laws, regulations, tariffs or policies, our financial condition, results of operations, regulatory outcomes and cash flows may be materially adversely affected.\nOur businesses are regulated under numerous environmental laws.  The cost of compliance with these laws, and changes to or additions to, or reinterpretations of the laws, could be significant.  Liability from the failure to comply with existing or changed laws could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nOur businesses are subject to extensive federal, state and local environmental laws and rules that regulate, among other things, air emissions, water usage and discharges, GHG and waste products such as coal combustion residuals. Compliance with these legal obligations require us to make expenditures for installation of pollution control equipment, remediation, environmental monitoring, emissions fees, and permits at many of our facilities. These expenditures are significant, and we expect that they will continue to be significant in the future. Furthermore, if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations or are found to have caused damage to the environment or persons, that failure or harm may result in the assessment of civil or criminal penalties and damages against us, injunctions to remedy the failure or harm, and the inability to operate facilities as designed.\nExisting environmental laws and regulations may be revised and new laws and regulations seeking to change environmental regulation of the energy industry may be adopted or become applicable to us, with an increasing focus on both coal and natural gas.  Revised or additional laws and regulations may result in significant additional expense and operating restrictions on our facilities or increased compliance costs, which may not be fully recoverable from customers through regulated rates and could, therefore, impact our financial position, financial results and cash flow. Moreover, such costs could materially affect the continued economic viability of one or more of our facilities.\nAn area of significant uncertainty and risk are the laws concerning emission of GHG. While we continue to reduce GHG emissions through the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, increased sourcing of renewable energy, priority pipeline replacement, energy efficiency programs, and leak detection and repair, GHG emissions are currently an expected aspect of the electric and natural gas business. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows.\n30\nITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nEven in instances where legal and regulatory requirements are already known or anticipated, the original cost estimates for environmental improvements, remediation of past environmental impact, or pollution reduction strategies and equipment can differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including the nature and extent of impact, the method of improvement, the cost of raw materials, contractor costs, and requirements established by environmental authorities.  Changes in costs and the ability to recover under regulatory mechanisms could affect our financial position, financial results and cash flows.\nChanges in taxation and the ability to quantify such changes as well as challenges to tax positions could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe are subject to taxation by the various taxing authorities at the federal, state and local levels where we do business. Legislation or regulation which could affect our tax burden could be enacted by any of these governmental authorities. For example, the TCJA includes numerous provisions that affect businesses, including changes to U.S. corporate tax rates, business-related exclusions, deductions and credits. The outcome of regulatory proceedings regarding the extent to which the effect of a change in corporate tax rate will impact customers and the time period over which the impact will occur could significantly impact future earnings and cash flows. Separately, a challenge by a taxing authority, changes in taxing authorities’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions, our ability to utilize tax benefits such as carryforwards or tax credits, or a deviation from other tax-related assumptions may cause actual financial results to deviate from previous estimates.\n31"

We do not, however, generally have specific easements from the owners of the property adjacent to public highways over, upon or under which our electric lines and gas distribution pipelines are located. At the time each of the principal properties were purchased, a title search was made. In general, no examination of titles as to rights-of-way for electric lines, gas pipelines or related facilities was made, other than examination, in certain cases, to verify the grantors’ ownership and the lien status thereof."

It also includes management’s analysis of past financial results and certain potential factors that may affect future results, potential future risks and approaches that may be used to manage those risks. See \"Note regarding forward-looking statements\" at the beginning of this report for a list of factors that may cause results to differ materially.\nManagement's Discussion is designed to provide an understanding of our operations and financial performance and should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and related Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this annual report.\nWe are an energy holding company under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 2005 whose subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in six states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses, which are summarized for financial reporting purposes into two primary reportable segments: Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations.\nRefer to the \"Business\" section under Item 1 of this annual report and Note 23, \"Segments of Business,\" in the Notes to  Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of our regulated utility business segments.\nOur goal is to develop strategies that benefit all stakeholders as we (i) embark on long-term infrastructure investment and safety programs to better serve our customers, (ii) align our tariff structures with our cost structure, and (iii) address changing customer conservation patterns. These strategies focus on improving safety and reliability, enhancing customer service, ensuring customer affordability and reducing emissions while generating sustainable returns. The safety of our customers, communities and employees remains our top priority. The SMS is an established operating model within NiSource. With the continued support and advice from our Quality Review Board (a panel of third parties with safety operations expertise engaged by management to advise on safety matters), we are continuing to mature our SMS processes, capabilities and talent as we collaborate within and across industries to enhance safety and reduce operational risk. Additionally, we continue to pursue regulatory and legislative initiatives that will allow residential customers not currently on our system to obtain gas service in a cost effective manner.\n2021 Overview:\nIn 2021, we made significant progress towards our strategic and financial goals and objectives. We commenced commercial operations of Indiana Crossroads Wind, adding 302 MW of renewable generating capacity to our Electric Operations. Additionally, we broke ground on two solar projects and received regulatory approval to complete another nine renewable energy projects by the end of 2023. We filed base rate cases in five states, completing three cases in 2021 with balanced outcomes supporting all stakeholders. We also invested $1.3 billion in infrastructure modernization to enhance safe, reliable service, including replacement of 390 miles of priority pipe, 54 miles of underground cable and 2,857 electric poles. Through the issuance of our Equity Units, we significantly de-risked our financing strategy and supported our investment grade credit rating.\nWe made advancements on key strategic initiatives, described in further detail below.\nYour Energy, Your Future:\nOur plan to replace our coal generation capacity by the end of 2028 with primarily renewable resources is well underway. As of December 31, 2021, we have executed and received IURC approval for BTAs and PPAs with a combined nameplate capacity of 1,950 MW and 1,380 MW, respectively, under the plan. On October 1, 2021, we completed\n35\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nthe retirement of R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Units 14 and 15. On October 21, 2021, we announced the Preferred Energy Resource Plan associated with our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan, which refines the timeline to retire the Michigan City Generating Station to occur between 2026 and 2028. The plan calls for the replacement of the retiring units with a diverse portfolio of resources including demand side management resources, incremental solar, stand-alone energy storage and upgrades to existing facilities at the Sugar Creek Generating Station, among other steps. Additionally, the plan calls for a natural gas peaking unit to replace existing vintage gas peaking units at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station to support system reliability and resiliency, as well as upgrades to the transmission system to enhance our electric generation transition. The planned retirement of the two vintage gas peaking units at the R.M. Schahfer Generating Station is expected to occur between 2025 and 2028. Final retirement dates for these units, as well as Michigan City, will be subject to MISO approval. We filed our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan with the IURC in November 2021. In December 2021, the formation of the Indiana Crossroads Wind joint venture, one of our previously executed BTAs, was completed, and began commercial operations. For additional information, see Note 4, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements and \"Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,\" in this Management's Discussion.\nNiSource Next:\nIn 2020, we launched a comprehensive, multi-year program designed to deliver long-term safety, sustainable capability enhancements and costs optimization improvements. This program advances the high priority we place on safety and risk mitigation, further enables our SMS, and enhances the customer experience. NiSource Next is designed to leverage our current scale, utilize technology,  define clear roles and accountability with our leaders and employees, and standardize our processes to focus on operational rigor, quality management and continuous improvement.\nIn 2021, we optimized our workforce by redefining roles to sharpen our focus on safety and risk mitigation, operational rigor, and adherence to process and procedures, as well as implemented consistent span of control for leadership to increase individual responsibility and clear accountability. Additionally, we began to make advancements across our operations to improve safety, operational efficiencies, and customer satisfaction through continued standardization of work processes, the implementation of new mobile technology to provide real-time access to information while serving our customers and enhanced customer self-service options to better meet customer expectations. These enhancements set the foundation for 2022 and beyond, to continue improving safety and customer experience through more significant technology investments.\nCOVID-19:\nThe safety of our employees and customers, while providing essential services during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, is paramount. We continue to take a proactive, coordinated approach intended to prevent, mitigate and respond to COVID-19 by utilizing our Incident Command System (ICS). The ICS includes members of our executive council, a medical review professional, and members of functional teams from across our company. The ICS monitors state-by-state conditions and determines steps to conduct our operations safely for employees and customers.\nWe have implemented procedures designed to protect our employees who work in the field and who continue to work in operational and corporate facilities, including social distancing and wearing face coverings. We have also implemented work-from-home policies and practices. We continue to employ physical and cybersecurity measures to ensure that our operational and support systems remain functional. Our actions to date have mitigated the spread of COVID-19 amongst our employees and principal field contractors. We are also continuously evaluating changes to CDC guidance, and updating our safety measures accordingly, in order to ensure employee and customer safety during this pandemic. We are following federal, state, and local laws, regulations and guidelines related to the COVID-19 vaccinations.\nSince the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have been helping our customers navigate this challenging time. We plan to continue our payment assistance programs and customer education and awareness of energy assistance programs such as the Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) to help customers deal with the impact of the pandemic. Regulatory deferrals for certain costs have been allowed by all of our state regulatory commissions.\nWe continue to monitor how COVID-19 is affecting our workforce, customers, suppliers, operations, financial results and cash flow. The extent of the impact in the future will vary and depend on the duration and severity of the impact on the global, national and local economies.  For information on the impacts of COVID-19 for the year ended December 31, 2021, the state-specific suspension of disconnections, and COVID-19 regulatory filings see Note 3, ''Revenue Recognition,'' and Note 9, ''Regulatory Matters,'' in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEconomic Environment:\nWe are monitoring risks related to increasing order and delivery lead times for construction and other materials, increasing risk of unavailability of materials due to global shortages in raw materials, and risk of decreased construction labor productivity in the event of disruptions in the availability of materials. We are also seeing increasing prices\n36\nITEM 7.

To the extent that delays occur or our costs increase, our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are faced with increased competition for employee and contractor talent in the current labor market, which has resulted in increased costs to attract and retain talent. We are ensuring that we use all internal human capital programs (development, leadership enablement programs, succession, performance management) to promote retention of our current employees along with having competitive and attractive appeal for potential recruits. With a focus on workforce planning, we are creating flexible work arrangements where we can, and being anticipatory in evaluating our talent footprint for the future to ensure we have the right people, in the right role, and at the right time. To the extent we are unable to execute on our workforce planning initiatives and experience increased employee and contractor costs, our business operations, results of operations, cash flows, and financial condition could be materially adversely affected.\nWe have also seen an increase in gas costs that we expect to have an effect on customer bills.  For the year ended December 31, 2021, we have not seen this increase have a material impact on our results of operations. For more information on our commodity price impacts, see \" - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Gas Distribution Operations,\" and \" - Market Risk Disclosures.\"\nFor more information on global availability of materials for our renewable projects, see \" - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations - Electric Supply and Generation Transition.\"\nSummary of Consolidated Financial Results\nA summary of our consolidated financial results for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, are presented below:\nThe majority of the costs of energy in both segments are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer, resulting in an equal and offsetting amount reflected in operating revenues.\nThe increase in net income available to common shareholders during 2021 was primarily due to higher operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. Operating revenues were higher due to favorable rate case outcomes in 2021. Operating expenses were lower as we did not have expenses associated with the Massachusetts business in 2021, and the loss on sale of the Massachusetts business was primarily incurred in 2020. For additional information on operating income variance drivers see \"Results and Discussion of Segment Operations\" for Gas and Electric Operations in this Management's Discussion. In addition, we recognized a favorable change in total other deductions, which was partially offset by an increase in income tax expense in 2021. See below for the primary drivers of this change.\n37\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nOther Deductions, Net\nThe change in Other deductions, net in 2021 compared to 2020 is primarily driven by the loss on early extinguishment of debt in 2020, lower long-term and short-term debt interest in 2021 and higher non-service pension benefits partially offset by charitable contributions in 2021. The lower interest in 2021 was due to the early extinguishment of high rate debt in 2020 and lower balances on short-term debt during the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. See Note 15, \"Long-Term Debt,\" Note 16, \"Short-Term Borrowings,\" and Note 12, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIncome Taxes\nThe increase in income tax expense in 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 is primarily attributable to higher pre-tax income, resulting from the items discussed above, state jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income in 2021 tax effected at statutory tax rates and increased amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes in 2021 compared to 2020.  These items are offset by decreased deferred tax expense recognized on the sale of the Columbia of Massachusetts' regulatory liability in 2020, established due to TCJA in 2017, that would have otherwise been recognized over the amortization period and one-time adjustments to deferred tax balances.\nRefer to Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on income taxes and the change in the effective tax rate.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION OF OPERATIONS\nPresentation of Segment Information\nOur operations are divided into two primary reportable segments: Gas Distribution Operations and Electric Operations. The remainder of our operations, which are not significant enough on a stand-alone basis to warrant treatment as an operating segment, are presented as \"Corporate and Other\" within the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and primarily are comprised of interest expense on holding company debt, and unallocated corporate costs and activities.\n38\nITEM 7.

Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Gas Distribution Operations,\" of the Company's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of underlying reasons for changes in our operating revenues and expenses for 2020 versus 2019.\nWeather\nIn general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating degree days, net of weather normalization mechanisms. Our composite heating degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of Gas Distribution Operations. Heating degree days experienced during different times of the year or in different operating locations may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when and where they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating degree day comparison.\nThroughput\nThe decrease in total volumes sold and transported in 2021 compared to 2020 of 54.5 MMDth is primarily attributable to the sale of the Massachusetts Business in 2020.\nCommodity Price Impact\nCost of energy for the Gas Distribution Operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of natural gas used while providing transportation and distribution services to customers. All of our Gas Distribution Operations companies have state-approved recovery mechanisms that provide a means for full recovery of prudently incurred gas costs.  These are tracked costs that are passed through directly to the customer, and the gas costs included in revenues are matched with the gas cost expense recorded in the period. The difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered gas cost to be included in future customer billings. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.\nCertain Gas Distribution Operations companies continue to offer choice opportunities, where customers can choose to purchase gas from a third-party supplier, through regulatory initiatives in their respective jurisdictions.\n40\nITEM 7.

In March 2021, we reached an agreement with Eversource regarding the final purchase price, including net working capital adjustments. This resulted in a pre-tax loss for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 of $6.8 million and $412.4 million, respectively, based on asset and liability balances as of the close of the transaction on October 9, 2020, transaction costs and the final purchase price.

Please refer to Part II, Item 7, \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations - Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,\" of the Company's 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K for discussion of underlying reasons for changes in our operating revenues and expenses for 2020 versus 2019.\nWeather\nIn general, we calculate the weather-related revenue variance based on changing customer demand driven by weather variance from normal heating or cooling degree days. Our composite heating or cooling degree days reported do not directly correlate to the weather-related dollar impact on the results of Electric Operations. Heating or cooling degree days experienced during different times of the year may have more or less impact on volume and dollars depending on when they occur. When the detailed results are combined for reporting, there may be weather-related dollar impacts on operations when there is not an apparent or significant change in our aggregated composite heating or cooling degree day comparison.\nSales\nThe increase in total volumes sold in 2021 compared to 2020 of 1,027.8 GWh was primarily attributable to decreased usage by industrial and commercial customers during the second and third quarters of 2020 due to COVID-19. There was no significant variance during the first three months and last three months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\nCommodity Price Impact\nCost of energy for the Electric Operations segment is principally comprised of the cost of coal, natural gas purchased for internal generation of electricity at NIPSCO, and the cost of power purchased from third-party generators of electricity. NIPSCO has a state-approved recovery mechanism that provides a means for full recovery of prudently incurred fuel costs. The majority of these fuel costs are passed through directly to the customer, and the fuel costs included in operating revenues are matched with the fuel cost expense recorded in the period. The difference is recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as under-recovered or over-recovered fuel cost to be included in future customer billings. Therefore, increases in these tracked operating expenses are offset by increases in operating revenues and have essentially no impact on net income.\n43\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nElectric Operations (continued)\nNIPSCO's performance remains closely linked to the performance of the steel industry. NIPSCO’s MWh sales to steel-related industries accounted for approximately 48.1% and 45.9% of the total industrial MWh sales for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nElectric Supply and Generation Transition\nNIPSCO continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the preferred pathway from its 2018 Integrated Resource Plan, which outlines plans to retire its remaining coal-fired generation by 2028, to be replaced by lower-cost, reliable and cleaner options. We expect to have capital investment requirements of approximately $2.0 billion, primarily in 2022 and 2023, to replace the generation capacity of R.M. Schahfer Generating Station's coal-fired units. We retired R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Units 14 and 15 on October 1, 2021. The remaining two units are still scheduled to be retired in 2023. Refer to Note 6, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" and Note 19-F, \"Other Matters,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nThe current replacement plan primarily includes renewable sources of energy, including wind, solar, and battery storage to be obtained through a combination of NIPSCO ownership and PPAs. NIPSCO has sold, and may in the future sell, renewable energy credits from this generation to third parties because this helps keep the cost of energy more affordable for our customers. NIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. Each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity, and payments under the PPAs will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the owner/seller. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. Our current replacement program will be augmented by the Preferred Energy Resource Plan outlined in our 2021 Integrated Resource Plan. See \"Executive Summary - Your Energy, Your Future\" in this Management's Discussion for additional information.\n44\nITEM 7.

The potential delays to solar panel deliveries relate to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security's June 24, 2021 Withhold Release Order on silica-based products made by Hoshine Silicon Industry Co., Ltd. For all affected projects, the sellers have informed us that they are working diligently to mitigate potential impacts and determine recovery plans, where applicable, in order to minimize potential delays or failures to perform under the agreements. We are also evaluating what, if any, additional flexibility can be afforded to the sellers under these agreements to aid in mitigating, or minimizing, potential delays or failures to perform under the agreements. We, along with the sellers of these generation projects, are continuously evaluating potential impacts to the targeted completion date of each project. At this time, the impact of any delays to materials, permitting or interconnection on the targeted completion dates has not been determined but could include a delay in the financial return of certain investments and timing of our electric generation transition.\n45\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe continually evaluate the availability of adequate financing to fund our ongoing business operations, working capital and core safety and infrastructure investment programs. Our financing is sourced through cash flow from operations and the issuance of debt and/or equity. External debt financing is provided primarily through the issuance of long-term debt, accounts receivable securitization programs and our $1.5 billion commercial paper program, which is backstopped by our committed revolving credit facility with a total availability from third-party lenders of $1.85 billion. On February 18, 2022, we amended our revolving credit agreement to, among other things, extend its term to February 18, 2027. The commercial paper program and credit facility provide cost-effective, short-term financing until it can be replaced with a balance of long-term debt and equity financing that achieves our desired capital structure. We utilize an ATM equity program that allows us to issue and sell shares of our common stock up to an aggregate issuance of $750.0 million through December 31, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, the ATM program (including the impact of the forward sale agreement) had approximately $300.0 million of equity available for issuance. On April 19, 2021, we completed the sale of 8.625 million Equity Units, which provided net proceeds of $835.5 million\n, after underwriting and issuance costs. We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering for renewable generation investments and general corporate purposes, including additions to working capital and repayment of existing indebtedness. See\nNote 13, ''Equity,'' in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information on our ATM program and Equity Units.\nWe believe these sources provide adequate capital to fund our operating activities and capital expenditures in 2022 and beyond.\nGreater Lawrence Incident.\nAs discussed in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors,\" and in Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, due to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the outcome or resolution of any particular claim related to the Greater Lawrence Incident will not continue to have an adverse impact on our cash flows. Through income generated from operating activities, amounts available under the short-term revolving credit facility, and our ability to access capital markets, we believe we have adequate capital available to settle remaining anticipated claims associated with the Greater Lawrence Incident.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash from operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,217.9 million, an increase of $113.9 million from 2020. This increase was primarily driven by a year over year decrease in net payments related to the Greater Lawrence Incident. During 2021, we paid $15.6 million compared to $226.7 million of payments during the same period in 2020. This was offset by increased cash outflows related to inventory balances primarily due to lower purchasing and prices in 2020 as well as decreased cash inflows related to the under collection of gas and fuel costs.\nInvesting Activities\nNet cash used for investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $2,204.9 million, an increase of $1,325.8 million from 2020. In 2020, our investing outflows were lower by $1,115.9 million as a result of proceeds from the sale of the Massachusetts Business. Our current year investing activities were comprised of capital expenditures related to system growth and reliability and payments made to the developers of our renewable generation assets.\n46\nITEM 7.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nSources of Liquidity\nThe following table displays our liquidity position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(1)\nRepresents the lesser of the seasonal limit or maximum borrowings supportable by the underlying receivables. Our accounts receivable programs' utilization was zero as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nDebt Covenants\n.\nWe are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility, which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed 70%. As of December 31, 2021, the ratio was 57.4%.\nCredit Ratings\n.\nThe credit rating agencies periodically review our ratings, taking into account factors such as our capital structure and earnings profile. The following table includes our and NIPSCO's credit ratings and ratings outlook as of December 31, 2021. There have been no changes to our credit ratings or outlooks since February 2020.\nA credit rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities, and may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have agreements that contain “ratings triggers” that require increased collateral if our credit ratings or the credit ratings of certain of our subsidiaries are below investment grade.  These agreements are primarily for insurance purposes and for the physical purchase or sale of power. As of December 31, 2021, a collateral requirement of  approximately $56.2 million would be required in the event of a downgrade below investment grade. In addition to agreements with ratings triggers, there are other agreements that contain “adequate assurance” or “material adverse change” provisions that could necessitate additional credit support such as letters of credit and cash collateral to transact business.\nEquity.\nOur authorized capital stock consists of 620,000,000 shares, $0.01 par value, of which 600,000,000 are common stock and 20,000,000 are preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, 405,303,023 shares of common stock and 1,302,500 shares of preferred stock were outstanding. For more information regarding our common and preferred stock, see Note 13, \"Equity,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nContractual Obligations, Cash Requirements and Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. Our material cash requirements are detailed below. We intend to use funds from the liquidity sources referenced above to meet these cash requirements.\nOur calculated estimated interest payments for long-term debt are based on the stated coupon and payment dates. For 2022, we project that we will be required to make interest payments of approximately $338.5 million, which includes $335.7 million of interest payments related to our long-term debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021. At December 31, 2021, we had $560.0 million in short-term borrowings outstanding. Refer to Note 15, \"Long-Term Debt,\" and Note 16, \"Short-Term Borrowings,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on long-term debt and short-term borrowings, respectively.\n49\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nDuring 2022 and 2023, we expect to make cash payments of $610.5 million and $366.0 million, respectively, related to pipeline service obligations including demand for gas transportation, gas storage and gas purchases.\nWe expect to have capital investment requirements of approximately $2.0 billion, primarily in 2022 and 2023, to replace the generation capacity of all R.M. Schahfer Generating Station's coal-fired units. These investments include our portion of the joint venture obligations including construction milestone payments included in the agreements.\nOur expected payments include employer contributions to pension and other postretirement benefits plans expected to be made in 2022. Plan contributions beyond 2022 are dependent upon a number of factors, including actual returns on plan assets, which cannot be reliably estimated at this time. In 2022, we expect to make contributions of approximately $2.8 million to our pension plans and approximately $21.5 million to our postretirement medical and life plans. Refer to Note 12, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nWe cannot reasonably estimate the settlement amounts or timing of cash flows related to certain of our long-term obligations classified as \"Total Other Liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nWe also have obligations associated with income, property, gross receipts, franchise, sales and use, and various other taxes and expect to make tax payments of approximately $291.1 million in 2022. In addition, we have uncertain income tax positions for which we are unable to predict when the matters will be resolved.  Refer to Note 11, \"Income Taxes,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for more information.\nNIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase 100% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. See Note 19-A, \"Contractual Obligations,\" and Note 19-F, \"Other Matters - Generation Transition,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn addition, we, along with certain of our subsidiaries, enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit.\nRefer to Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our contractual obligations over the next 5 years and thereafter and our off-balance sheet arrangements.\nEnvironmental and Safety Matters\nPHMSA Regulations\nOn December 27, 2020, the Protecting Our Infrastructure of Pipelines and Enhancing Safety (PIPES) Act of 2020 was signed into law, reauthorizing funding for federal pipeline safety programs through September 30, 2023. Among other things, the PIPES Act requires that PHMSA revise the pipeline safety regulations to require operators to update, as needed, their existing distribution integrity management plans, emergency response plans, and operation and maintenance plans. The PIPES Act also requires PHMSA to adopt new requirements for managing records and updating, as necessary, existing district regulator stations to eliminate common modes of failure that can lead to overpressurization. PHMSA must also require that operators implement and utilize advanced leak detection technologies that enable the location and categorization of  all leaks that are hazardous, or potentially hazardous, to human safety or the environment. Natural gas companies, including NiSource and our subsidiaries, may see increased costs depending on how PHMSA implements the new mandates resulting from the PIPES Act.\nClimate Change Issues\nIncreased frequency of severe and extreme weather events associated with climate change could materially impact our facilities, energy sales, and results of operations. We are unable to predict these events. However, we perform ongoing assessments of physical risk, including physical climate risk, to our business. More extreme and volatile temperatures, increased storm intensity and flooding, and more volatile precipitation leading to changes in lake and river levels are among the weather events that are most likely to impact our business. Efforts to mitigate these physical risks continue to be implemented on an ongoing basis.\nFuture legislative and regulatory programs, at both the federal and state levels, could significantly limit allowed GHG emissions or impose a cost or tax on GHG emissions. Revised or additional future GHG legislation and/or regulation related to the generation of electricity or the extraction, production, distribution, transmission, storage and end use of natural gas could materially impact our gas supply, financial position, financial results and cash flows. We continue to monitor the implementation of final and proposed legislation and regulations, including the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Build\n50\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nBack Better legislation and the EPA's proposed methane regulations for the oil and natural gas industry, but we cannot predict their final form or impact on our business at this time.\nOn July 8, 2019, the EPA published the final ACE rule, which establishes emission guidelines for states to use when developing plans to limit carbon dioxide at coal-fired electric generating units based on heat rate improvement measures. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit vacated and remanded the rule on January 19, 2021. On October 29, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to review the scope of the EPA’s authority to impose GHG emission standards under the Clean Air Act. We will continue to monitor this matter.\nIn February 2021, the United States rejoined the Paris Agreement, an international treaty through which parties set nationally determined contributions to reduce GHG emissions, build resilience, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. Subsequently, the Biden Administration released a target for the United States to achieve a 50%-52% GHG reduction from 2005 levels by 2030, which supports the President's goals to create a carbon-free power sector by 2035 and net zero emissions economy no later than 2050. There are many pathways to reach these goals.\nIn 2021, the Maryland Commission of Climate Change published a Building Energy Transition Plan. Policy recommendations included in this plan, such as the adoption of an all-electric construction code, are supported by the Commission but do not necessarily reflect current state policy. The report is intended to guide Maryland policy makers on decisions related to reducing GHG emissions from buildings in pursuit of achieving targets in Maryland's  2030 Greenhouse Gas Reduction Act Plan and the Commission's recommendation that Maryland achieve net-zero emissions by 2045. Columbia of Maryland will continue to monitor this matter, but we cannot predict its final impact on our business at this time.\nIn response to these transition risks, we continue to actively implement our plans to reduce Scope 1 GHG emissions by 90% from 2005 levels by 2030, and to significantly reduce methane emissions, a component of Scope 1 GHG emissions.  These plans include the retirement of coal-fired electric generation, increased sourcing of renewable energy, and methane reductions from priority pipeline replacement, traditional leak detection and repair, and deployment of advanced leak detection and repair. As discussed above in this Management's Discussion within \"Results and Discussion of Segment Operations - Electric Operations,\" NIPSCO continues to execute on an electric generation transition consistent with the preferred pathways identified in its 2018 and 2021 Integrated Resource Plans. We expect to have capital investment requirements of approximately $2.0 billion, primarily in 2022 and 2023, to replace the generation capacity previously supplied by R.M. Schahfer. We continue to expect to retire Michigan City Generating Station between 2026 and 2028. The preferred path of the 2021 Integrated Resource plan outlined new generation investments estimated to be up to $750 million, and we are currently evaluating future projects in line with the preferred path.\nAdditionally, we are active in several efforts to accelerate the development and demonstration of lower-carbon energy technologies and resources, such as hydrogen and renewable natural gas (RNG), to enable affordable pathways to economy-wide decarbonization.\nMarket Risk Disclosures\nRisk is an inherent part of our businesses. The extent to which we properly and effectively identify, assess, monitor and manage each of the various types of risk involved in our businesses is critical to our profitability. We seek to identify, assess, monitor and manage, in accordance with defined policies and procedures, the following principal market risks that are involved in our businesses: commodity price risk, interest rate risk and credit risk. We manage risk through a multi-faceted process with oversight by the Risk Management Committee that requires constant communication, judgment and knowledge of specialized products and markets. Our senior management takes an active role in the risk management process and has developed policies and procedures that require specific administrative and business functions to assist in the identification, assessment and control of various risks. These may include, but are not limited to market, operational, financial, compliance and strategic risk types. In recognition of the increasingly varied and complex nature of the energy business, our risk management process, policies and procedures continue to evolve and are subject to ongoing review and modification.\nCommodity Price Risk\nOur Gas and Electric Operations have commodity price risk primarily related to the purchases of natural gas and power. To manage this market risk, our subsidiaries use derivatives, including commodity futures contracts, swaps, forwards and options. We do not participate in speculative energy trading activity.\nCommodity price risk resulting from derivative activities at our rate-regulated subsidiaries is limited and does not bear signification exposure to earnings risk, since regulations allow recovery of prudently incurred purchased power, fuel and gas\n51\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\ncosts through the rate-making process, including gains or losses on these derivative instruments. These changes are included in the GCA and FAC regulatory rate-recovery mechanisms. If these mechanisms were to be adjusted or eliminated, these subsidiaries may begin providing services without the benefit of the traditional rate-making process and may be more exposed to commodity price risk.\nOur subsidiaries are required to make cash margin deposits with their brokers to cover actual and potential losses in the value of outstanding exchange traded derivative contracts. The amount of these deposits, some of which is reflected in our restricted cash balance, may fluctuate significantly during periods of high volatility in the energy commodity markets.\nRefer to Note 10, \"Risk Management Activities,\" in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our commodity price risk assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving credit agreement, commercial paper program and accounts receivable programs, which have interest rates that are indexed to short-term market interest rates.  Based upon average borrowings and debt obligations subject to fluctuations in short-term market interest rates, an increase (or decrease) in short-term interest rates of 100 basis points (1%) would have increased (or decreased) interest expense by $3.1 million and $12.3 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. We are also exposed to interest rate risk as a result of changes in benchmark rates that can influence the interest rates of future debt issuances. From time to time we may enter into forward interest rate instruments to lock in long term interest costs and/ or rates.\nRefer to Note 10, \"Risk Management Activities,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information on our interest rate risk assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nCredit Risk\nDue to the nature of the industry, credit risk is embedded in many of our business activities. Our extension of credit is governed by a Corporate Credit Risk Policy. In addition, our Risk Management Committee has put guidelines in place which document management approval levels for credit limits, evaluation of creditworthiness, and credit risk mitigation efforts. Exposures to credit risks are monitored by the risk management function, which is independent of commercial operations. Credit risk arises due to the possibility that a customer, supplier or counterparty will not be able or willing to fulfill its obligations on a transaction on or before the settlement date. For derivative-related contracts, credit risk arises when counterparties are obligated to deliver or purchase defined commodity units of gas or power to us at a future date per execution of contractual terms and conditions. Exposure to credit risk is measured in terms of both current obligations and the market value of forward positions net of any posted collateral such as cash and letters of credit.\nWe closely monitor the financial status of our banking credit providers. We evaluate the financial status of our banking partners through the use of market-based metrics such as credit default swap pricing levels, and also through traditional credit ratings provided by major credit rating agencies.\nCertain individual state regulatory commissions instituted regulatory moratoriums in connection with the COVID-19 pandemic that impacted our ability to pursue our credit risk mitigation practices for customer accounts receivable. Following the issuances of these moratoriums, certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to recognize a regulatory asset for bad debt costs above levels currently in rates. We have now resumed our common credit mitigation practices in all jurisdictions as these moratoriums have expired.  See the COVID-19 discussion in Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\" for risks that have been identified related to the pandemic and refer to Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for state specific regulatory moratoriums.\nOther Information\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe apply certain accounting policies in accordance with GAAP, which require that we make estimates and judgments that have had, and may continue to have, significant impacts on our operations and Consolidated Financial Statements. We evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. We believe the following represent the more significant items requiring the use of judgment in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements:\n52\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nBasis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.\nASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\n, provides that rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and if the competitive environment makes it probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recognized in income as the related amounts are included in service rates and recovered from or refunded to customers. The total amounts of regulatory assets and liabilities reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $2,492.2 million and $1,980.0 million at December 31, 2021, and $1,930.5 million and $2,065.5 million at December 31, 2020, respectively. For additional information, refer to Note 9, “Regulatory Matters,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nIn the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover our costs in the future, all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\n. In such event, a write-down of all or a portion of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result. If transition cost recovery is approved by the appropriate regulatory bodies that would meet the requirements under GAAP for continued accounting as regulatory assets and liabilities during such recovery period, the regulatory assets and liabilities would be reported at the recoverable amounts. If we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\n, we would be required to apply the provisions of ASC Topic 980-20,\nDiscontinuation of Rate-Regulated Accounting\n. In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\nfor the foreseeable future.\nCertain of the regulatory assets reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets require specific regulatory action in order to be included in future service rates. Although recovery of these amounts is not guaranteed, we believe that these costs meet the requirements for deferral as regulatory assets. If we determine that the amounts included as regulatory assets are no longer recoverable, a charge to income would immediately be required to the extent of the unrecoverable amounts.\nOne of the more significant items recorded through the application of this accounting guidance is the regulatory overlay for JV accounting. The application of HLBV to consolidated VIEs generally results in the recognition of profit from the related joint ventures over a time frame that is different from when the regulatory return is earned. In accordance with the principles of ASC 980, we have recognized a regulatory deferral of certain amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the joint ventures and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated joint ventures. For additional information, refer to Note 1-S, \"VIEs and Allocation of Earnings,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEquity Unit Transactions.\nWe record the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and forward purchase contracts that comprise the Corporate Units as a single unit of account and classify the Corporate Units as equity under the provisions of ASC 480 and ASC 815. Significant judgments regarding the economic linkage between the preferred stock and the forward purchase contracts, as well as the substance of the terms and conditions of the Corporate Units, were required by management in making these determinations.\nThe initial classification of the Corporate Units, whether viewed as a single unit of account or as two freestanding financial instruments, would affect our financial results. If determined to be two units of account, the forward purchase contracts underlying the Corporate Units would be classified as a derivative and result in impacts to net income through the recognition of interest expense and mark-to-market adjustments. If determined to be one unit of account,the equity classification of the Corporate Units would have no material impact on net income. Each classification has differing impacts to the numerator in the computation of EPS.\nWe consider that there are a small number of similar equity hosted unit structures and that our unit structure is unique. We also consider that the provisions of ASC 480 and ASC 815 that govern the determination of unit of account are highly complex and that alternate conclusions reached under this guidance would result in materially different financial results. See Note 13, \"Equity,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional details of the equity unit transaction.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits.\nWe have defined benefit plans for both pension and other postretirement benefits. The calculation of the net obligations and annual expense related to the plans requires a significant degree of judgment regarding the discount rates to be used in bringing the liabilities to present value, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care trend rates, and mortality rates, among other assumptions. Due to the size of the plans and the long-term nature of the associated liabilities, changes in the assumptions used in the actuarial estimates could have material impacts on the measurement of the net obligations and annual expense recognition. Differences between actuarial assumptions and actual plan results are deferred into\n53\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nAOCI or a regulatory balance sheet account, depending on the jurisdiction of our entity. These deferred gains or losses are then amortized into the income statement when the accumulated differences exceed 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets (known in GAAP as the “corridor” method) or when settlement accounting is triggered.\nThe discount rates, expected long-term rates of return on plan assets, health care cost trend rates and mortality rates are critical assumptions. Methods used to develop these assumptions are described below. While a third party actuarial firm assists with the development of many of these assumptions, we are ultimately responsible for selecting the final assumptions.\nThe discount rate is utilized principally in calculating the actuarial present value of pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. Our discount rates for both pension and other postretirement benefits are determined using spot rates along an AA-rated above median yield curve with cash flows matching the expected duration of benefit payments to be made to plan participants.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is a component utilized in calculating annual pension and other postretirement benefit plan costs. We estimate the expected return on plan assets by evaluating expected bond returns, equity risk premiums, target asset allocations, the effects of active plan management, the impact of periodic plan asset rebalancing and historical performance. We also consider the guidance from our investment advisors in making a final determination of our expected rate of return on assets. For measurement of 2021 net periodic benefit cost, we selected an expected pre-tax long-term rate of return of 5.20% and 5.50% for our pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets, respectively.\nWe estimate the assumed health care cost trend rate, which is used in determining our other postretirement benefit net expense, based upon our actual health care cost experience, the effects of recently enacted legislation, third-party actuarial surveys and general economic conditions.\nWe utilize a full yield curve approach to estimate the service and interest components of net periodic benefit cost for pension and other postretirement benefits by applying the specific spot rates along the yield curve used in the determination of the benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows. For further discussion of our pension and other postretirement benefits, see Note 12, “Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,” in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nTypically, we use the Society of Actuaries’ most recently published mortality data in developing a best estimate of mortality as part of the calculation of the pension and other postretirement benefit obligations. Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted our mortality assumption through 2023 to reflect anticipated slow recovery.\nThe following tables illustrate the effects of changes in these actuarial assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant:\n(1)\nBefore labor capitalization and regulatory deferrals.\n54\nITEM 7. MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nWe have six goodwill reporting units, comprised of the six state operating companies within the Gas Distribution Operations reportable segment. Our goodwill assets at December 31, 2021 were $1,486 million, most of which resulted from the acquisition of Columbia on November 1, 2000.\nAs required by GAAP, we test for impairment of goodwill on an annual basis and on an interim basis when events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment may exist. Our annual goodwill test takes place in the second quarter of each year and was performed on May 1, 2021. A qualitative (\"step 0\") test was completed on May 1, 2021 for all reporting units. In the Step 0 analysis, we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the applicable reporting units as compared to their baseline May 1, 2020 \"step 1\" fair value measurement. The results of this assessment indicated that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value of our reporting unit; therefore, no \"step 1\" analysis was required and no impairment charges were indicated. Since the annual evaluation, there have been no indications that the fair values of the goodwill reporting units have decreased below the carrying values.\nAs noted above, application of the qualitative goodwill impairment test requires evaluating various events and circumstances to determine whether it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. Although we believe all relevant factors were considered in the qualitative impairment analysis to reach the conclusion that goodwill is not impaired, significant changes in any one of the assumptions could potentially result in the recording of an impairment that could have significant impacts on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSee Note 7, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nUnbilled Revenue.\nWe record utility operating revenues when energy is delivered to our customers. However, the determination of energy sales to individual customers is based upon the reading of their meters, which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month. At the end of each month, amounts of energy delivered to customers since the date of their last meter reading are estimated and corresponding unbilled revenues are calculated. This unbilled revenue is estimated each month based upon historical usage, customer rates and weather. Significant fluctuations in energy demand for the unbilled period or changes in the composition of customer classes could impact the accuracy of the unbilled revenue estimate. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue Recognition,\" in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding our significant judgments and estimates related to unbilled revenue recognition.\nIncome Taxes.\nThe consolidated income tax provision and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, as well as any unrecognized tax benefits and valuation allowances, require use of estimates and significant management judgement. Although we believe that current estimates for deferred tax assets and liabilities are reasonable, actual results could differ from these estimates for a variety of reasons, including reasonable projections of taxable income, the ability and intent to implement tax planning strategies if necessary, and interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations across multiple taxing jurisdictions.  Ultimate resolution or clarification of income tax matters may result in favorable or unfavorable impacts to net income and cash flows, and adjustments to tax-related assets and liabilities could be material.\nWe account for uncertain income tax positions using a benefit recognition model with a two-step approach including a more-likely-than-not recognition threshold and a measurement approach based on the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. We evaluate each position based solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming the position will be examined by a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine whether the recognition threshold has been met and, if so, the appropriate amount of tax benefits to be recorded in the consolidated financial statements.  At  December 31, 2021 we had $21.7 million of unrecognized tax benefits. Changes in these unrecognized tax benefits may result from remeasurement of amounts expected to be realized, settlements with tax authorities and expiration of statutes of limitations.\nValuation allowances against deferred tax assets are recorded when we conclude it is more likely than not such asset will not be realized in future periods. Accounting for income taxes also requires that only tax benefits for positions taken or expected to be taken on tax returns that meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold can be recognized or continue to be recognized. We evaluate each position solely on the technical merits and facts and circumstances of the position, assuming that the position will be examined by a taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information. Significant judgment is required to determine recognition thresholds and the related amount of tax benefits to be recognized. At December 31, 2021, we had established $7.8 million of valuation allowances related to certain state NOL carryforwards.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements - Refer to Notes 1 and 9 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving customers in six states. These rate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged to and collected from customers. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the consolidated balance sheets and are later recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.\nThe Company’s subsidiaries’ rates are subject to regulatory rate-setting processes. Rates are determined and approved in regulatory proceedings based on an analysis of the subsidiaries’ costs to provide utility service and a return on, and recovery of, the subsidiaries’ investment in the utility business. Regulatory decisions can have an impact on the recovery of costs, the rate of return earned on investment, and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates. The respective commission’s regulation of rates is premised on the full recovery of prudently incurred costs and a reasonable rate of return on invested\n58\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\ncapital. Decisions to be made by the commission in the future will impact the accounting for regulated operations, including decisions about the amount of allowable costs and return on invested capital included in rates and any refunds that may be required. While the Company has indicated it expects to recover costs from customers through regulated rates, there is a risk that the commission will not approve: (1) full recovery of the costs of providing utility service, or (2) full recovery of all amounts invested in the utility business and a reasonable return on that investment.\nWe identified the accounting for rate-regulated subsidiaries as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management to support its assertions about impacted account balances and disclosures and the high degree of subjectivity involved in assessing the impact of future regulatory orders on the financial statements. Management judgments include assessing (1) the likelihood of recovery in future rates of incurred costs and (2) the likelihood of refund of amounts previously collected from customers. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by regulatory commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the rate making process due its inherent complexities.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the uncertainty of future decisions by the commissions included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of (1) the recovery in future rates of costs incurred as property, plant, and equipment and deferred as regulatory assets, and (2) a refund or a future reduction in rates that should be reported as regulatory liabilities. We also tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the initial recognition of amounts as property, plant, and equipment; regulatory assets or liabilities; and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments, that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates or of a future reduction in rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the commissions for the Company, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by interveners, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates or of a future reduction in rates based on precedents of the commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared to management’s recorded regulatory asset and liability balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s filings with the commissions and the filings with the commissions by intervenors that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions related to recoverability of recorded assets\n.\n•\nWe inquired of management about property, plant, and equipment that may be abandoned. For assets that were abandoned, we inquired of management about their considerations regarding the abandonment. We inspected minutes of the board of directors and regulatory orders and other filings with the commissions to identify evidence that may contradict management’s assertion regarding probability of an abandonment.\n•\nWith the assistance of professionals in our firm with expertise in the application of ASC Topic 980,\nRegulated Operations\n,  we evaluated management’s conclusions regarding the application of ASC Topic 980 to the timing differences between the amount of profit from the consolidated joint ventures and the amount included in regulated rates.\n•\nWe read the relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission for the Company’s renewable energy investments. We evaluated the appropriateness of recognizing a regulatory liability or asset representing timing differences between the profit allocated under the Hypothetical Liquidation at Book Value (HLBV) method related to the consolidated joint ventures and the allowed earnings included in regulatory rates. We also evaluated the appropriateness of the offset to the regulatory liability or asset recorded in depreciation expense.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the application of ASC Topic 980 to consolidated joint venture accounting.\n59\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nPreferred Stock—2021 Equity Units - Refer to Notes 5, 13, 18 and 24 to the consolidated financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn April 19, 2021, the Company completed the sale of 8.625 million equity units, initially consisting of corporate units, each with a stated amount of $100. Each corporate unit consists of a forward contract to purchase shares of the Company's common stock in the future (“Forward Contract”) and a 1/10th, or 10%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Preferred Stock”) (collectively the “Equity Units”).\nThe Forward Contract obligates holders to purchase shares of the Company's common stock on December 1, 2023, subject to early settlement in certain situations. The purchase price to be paid under the Forward Contract is $100 per Equity Unit and the number of shares to be purchased will be determined near the settlement date, subject to a maximum settlement rate. The Preferred Stock was pledged upon issuance as collateral to secure the purchase of the Company's common stock under the related Forward Contract. The Company will pay quarterly contract adjustment payments at the rate of 7.75% per year on the stated amount of $100 per Equity Unit.\nThe Preferred Stock initially will not bear any dividends and is expected to be remarketed prior to December 1, 2023. Following a successful remarketing, dividends may become payable on the Preferred Stock and/or the minimum conversion rate of the Preferred Stock may be increased. Each share of Preferred Stock will automatically convert based on a conversion rate on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be on or about March 1, 2024, unless previously converted. If no successful remarketing of the Preferred Stock has previously occurred, effective as of December 1, 2023, the conversion rate will be zero, no shares of the Company's common stock will be delivered upon automatic conversion, and each share of Preferred Stock will be automatically transferred to the Company on the mandatory conversion date without any payment of cash or shares of the Company's common stock thereon. In the event of such a remarketing failure, any share of Preferred Stock held as part of Equity Units will be automatically delivered to the Company on December 1, 2023 in full satisfaction of the relevant holder’s obligation under the related Forward Contracts.\nThe Company has concluded that the Forward Contracts and the Preferred Stock host represent a single unit of account and has recorded the Equity Units in equity as Preferred Stock. The present value of the quarterly contract adjustment payments was recorded as a liability, with the offset recorded in Preferred Stock.\nWe identified the accounting for the Equity Units as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management in the application of accounting guidance. Auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for financial instruments and extensive audit procedures to evaluate the accounting treatment associated with the Equity Units.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the accounting for the Equity Units included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s accounting assessment of the Equity Units.\n•\nWe read the applicable agreements and compared the key terms from the agreements to management’s analysis of the transaction.\n•\nWith the assistance of professionals in our firm with expertise in 1) accounting for financial instruments and 2) assessing probability of certain outcomes underlying the key accounting judgments, we evaluated management’s conclusions regarding the application of the appropriate accounting standards.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company's disclosure of the Equity Units transaction, including the related impacts to the financial statements.\n/s/\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 23, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n60\nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\n1.\nNature of Operations and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nA.\nCompany Structure and Principles of Consolidation.\nWe are an energy holding company incorporated in Delaware and headquartered in Merrillville, Indiana. Our subsidiaries are fully regulated natural gas and electric utility companies serving approximately\n3.7\nmillion customers in six states. We generate substantially all of our operating income through these rate-regulated businesses. The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of us, our majority-owned subsidiaries, and VIEs of which we are the primary beneficiary after the elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.\nB.\nUse of Estimates.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nC.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash.\nWe consider all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. We report amounts deposited in brokerage accounts for margin requirements as restricted cash. In addition, we have amounts deposited in trusts to satisfy requirements for the provision of various property, liability, workers compensation, and long-term disability insurance, which is classified as restricted cash on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and disclosed with cash and cash equivalents on the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows.\nD.\nAccounts Receivable and Unbilled Revenue.\nAccounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the last cycle billing date through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates, weather and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Accounts receivable fluctuates from year to year depending in large part on weather impacts and price volatility. Our accounts receivable on the Consolidated Balance Sheets include unbilled revenue, less reserves. The reserve for uncollectible receivables is our best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the existing accounts receivable. We determined the reserve based on historical experience and in consideration of current market conditions. Account balances are charged against the allowance when it is anticipated the receivable will not be recovered. Refer to Note 3, \"Revenue Recognition,\" for additional information on customer-related accounts receivable, including amounts related to unbilled revenues.\nE.\nInvestments in Debt Securities.\nOur investments in debt securities are carried at fair value and are designated as available-for-sale. These investments are included within “Available-for-sale debt securities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred income taxes, are recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income or loss. At each reporting period these investments are qualitatively and quantitatively assessed to determine whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors. Impairments related to credit loss are recorded through an allowance for credit losses. Impairments that are not related to credit losses are included in other comprehensive income and are reflected in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).\nNo\nmaterial impairment charges were recorded for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. Refer to Note 18, \"Fair Value,\" for additional information.\nF.\nBasis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries.\nRate-regulated subsidiaries account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the way in which regulators establish rates, if the rates established are designed to recover the costs of providing the regulated service and it is probable that such rates can be charged and collected. Certain expenses and credits subject to utility regulation or rate determination normally reflected in income are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are later recognized in income as the related amounts are included in customer rates and recovered from or refunded to customers.\nWe continually evaluate whether or not our operations are within the scope of ASC 980 and rate regulations.  As part of that analysis, we evaluate probability of recovery for our regulatory assets.  In management’s opinion, our regulated subsidiaries will be subject to regulatory accounting for the foreseeable future. Refer to Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nG.\nPlant and Other Property and Related Depreciation and Maintenance.\nProperty, plant and equipment (principally utility plant) is stated at cost. Our rate-regulated subsidiaries record depreciation using composite rates on a straight-line basis over the remaining service lives of the electric, gas and common properties, as approved by the appropriate regulators.\n68\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nNon-utility property includes renewable generation assets owned by joint ventures of which we are the primary beneficiary and is generally depreciated on a straight-line basis over the life of the associated assets. Refer to Note 6, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" for additional information related to depreciation expense.\nFor rate-regulated companies, AFUDC is capitalized on all classes of property except organization costs, land, autos, office equipment, tools and other general property purchases. The allowance is applied to construction costs for that period of time between the date of the expenditure and the date on which such project is placed in service. Our pre-tax rate for AFUDC was\n3.3\n% in 2021,\n2.6\n% in 2020 and\n3.0\n% in 2019.\nGenerally, our subsidiaries follow the practice of charging maintenance and repairs, including the cost of removal of minor items of property, to expense as incurred. When our subsidiaries retire regulated property, plant and equipment, original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable a regulated asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the gross amounts are classified as \"Non-Utility and Other \" as described in Note 6, \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\" If the asset is no longer operating but still subject to recovery, the net amount is classified in \"Regulatory assets\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If we are able to recover a full return of and on investment, the carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost. If we are not able to recover a full return on investment, a loss on impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\nWhen our subsidiaries sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from \"Net Property, Plant and Equipment\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. Refer to Note 6, \"Property, Plant and Equipment,\" for further information.\nExternal and internal costs associated with on-premise computer software developed for internal use are capitalized. Capitalization of such costs commences upon the completion of the preliminary stage of each project. Once the installed software is ready for its intended use, such capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis generally over a period of five years. External and internal up-front implementation costs associated with cloud computing arrangements that are service contracts are deferred on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Once the installed software is ready for its intended use, such deferred costs are amortized on a straight-line basis to \"Operation and maintenance,\" over the minimum term of the contract plus contractually-provided renewal periods that are reasonable expected to be exercised.\nH.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets.\nSubstantially all of our goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. We test our goodwill for impairment annually as of May 1, or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that goodwill might be impaired. Fair value of our reporting units is determined using a combination of income and market approaches. See Note 7, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,\" for additional information.\nI.\nAccounts Receivable Transfer Program.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have agreements with third parties to transfer certain accounts receivable without recourse. These transfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings. The entire gross receivables balance remains on the December 31, 2021 and 2020 Consolidated Balance Sheets. When amounts are securitized, the short-term debt is recorded in the amount of proceeds received from the transferees involved in the transactions. Refer to Note 16, \"Short Term Borrowings,\" for further information.\nJ.\nGas Cost and Fuel Adjustment Clause.\nOur regulated subsidiaries defer most differences between gas and fuel purchase costs and the recovery of such costs in revenues and adjust future billings for such deferrals on a basis consistent with applicable state-approved tariff provisions. These deferred balances are recorded as \"Regulatory assets\" or \"Regulatory liabilities,\" as appropriate, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Refer to Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nK.\nInventory.\nBoth the LIFO inventory methodology and the weighted average cost methodology are used to value natural gas in storage, as approved by regulators for all of our regulated subsidiaries. Inventory valued using LIFO was $\n44.9\nmillion and $\n42.3\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Based on the average cost of gas using the LIFO method, the estimated replacement cost of gas in storage was less than the stated LIFO cost by\n$\n13.6\nmillion\nand $\n19.6\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As all LIFO inventory costs are collected from customers through our rate-\n69\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nregulated subsidiaries, no inventory impairment has been recorded. Gas inventory valued using the weighted average cost methodology was $\n282.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n148.8\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nElectric production fuel is valued using the weighted average cost inventory methodology, as approved by NIPSCO's regulator.\nMaterials and supplies are valued using the weighted average cost inventory methodology.\nL.\nAccounting for Exchange and Balancing Arrangements of Natural Gas.\nOur Gas Distribution Operations segment enters into balancing and exchange arrangements of natural gas as part of its operations and off-system sales programs. We record a receivable or payable for any of our respective cumulative gas imbalances, as well as for any gas inventory borrowed or lent under a Gas Distribution Operations exchange agreement. Exchange gas is valued based on individual regulatory jurisdiction requirements (for example, historical spot rate, spot at the beginning of the month).  These receivables and payables are recorded as “Exchange gas receivable” or “Exchange gas payable” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate.\nM.\nAccounting for Risk Management Activities.\nWe account for our derivatives and hedging activities in accordance with ASC 815. We recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value, unless such contracts are exempted as a normal purchase normal sale under the provisions of the standard. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and resulting designation.\nWe do not offset the fair value amounts recognized for any of our derivative instruments against the fair value amounts recognized for the right to reclaim cash collateral or obligation to return cash collateral for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement. See Note 10, \"Risk Management Activities,\" for additional information.\nN.\nIncome Taxes and Investment Tax Credits.\nWe record income taxes to recognize full interperiod tax allocations.\nUnder the asset and liability method, deferred income taxes are provided for the tax consequences of temporary differences by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amount and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. Investment tax credits associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction to income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties.\nTo the extent certain deferred income taxes of the regulated companies are recoverable or payable through future rates, regulatory assets and liabilities have been established. Regulatory assets for income taxes are primarily attributable to property-related tax timing differences for which deferred taxes had not been provided in the past, when regulators did not recognize such taxes as costs in the rate-making process. Regulatory liabilities for income taxes are primarily attributable to the regulated companies’ obligation to refund to ratepayers deferred income taxes provided at rates higher than the current Federal income tax rate. Such property-related amounts are credited to ratepayers using either the average rate assumption method or the reverse South Georgia method. Non property-related amounts are credited to ratepayers consistent with state utility commission direction.\nPursuant to the Internal Revenue Code and relevant state taxing authorities, we and our subsidiaries file consolidated income tax returns for federal and certain state jurisdictions. We and our subsidiaries are parties to a tax sharing agreement.  Income taxes recorded by each party represent amounts that would be owed had the party been separately subject to tax.\nO.\nPension Remeasurement.\nWe utilize a third-party actuary for the purpose of performing actuarial valuations of our defined benefit plans. Annually, as of December 31, we perform a remeasurement for our pension plans. Quarterly, we monitor for significant events, and if a significant event is identified, we perform a qualitative and quantitative assessment to determine if the resulting remeasurement would materially impact the NiSource financial statements. If material, an interim remeasurement is performed. We had one such interim remeasurement in the first quarter of 2021. See Note 12, \"Pension and Other Postretirement Benefits,\" for additional information.\nP.\nEnvironmental Expenditures.\nWe accrue for costs associated with environmental remediation obligations, including expenditures related to asset retirement obligations and cost of removal, when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated, regardless of when the expenditures are actually made. The undiscounted estimated future expenditures are based on currently enacted laws and regulations, existing technology and estimated site-specific costs where assumptions may be made about the nature and extent of site contamination, the extent of cleanup efforts, costs of alternative cleanup methods and other variables. The liability is adjusted as further information is discovered or circumstances change. The accruals for estimated environmental expenditures are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in “Other accruals” for short-term portions of these liabilities and “Other noncurrent liabilities” for the respective long-term portions of\n70\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nthese liabilities. Rate-regulated subsidiaries applying regulatory accounting establish regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets to the extent that future recovery of environmental remediation costs is probable through the regulatory process. Refer to Note 8, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" and Note 19, \"Other Commitments and Contingencies,\" for further information.\nQ.\nExcise Taxes.\nAs an agent for some state and local governments, we invoice and collect certain excise taxes levied by state and local governments on customers and record these amounts as liabilities payable to the applicable taxing jurisdiction.  Such balances are presented within \"Other accruals\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These types of taxes collected from customers, comprised largely of sales taxes, are presented on a net basis affecting neither revenues nor cost of sales. We account for excise taxes for which we are liable by recording a liability for the expected tax with a corresponding charge to “Other taxes” expense on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).\nR.\nAccrued Insurance Liabilities.\nWe accrue for insurance costs related to workers compensation, automobile, property, general and employment practices liabilities based on the most probable value of each claim. In general, claim values are determined by professional, licensed loss adjusters who consider the facts of the claim, anticipated indemnification and legal expenses, and respective state rules. Claims are reviewed by us at least quarterly and an adjustment is made to the accrual based on the most current information.\nS.\nVIEs and Allocation of Earnings.\nWe fund a significant portion of our renewable generation assets through joint ventures with tax equity partners. We consolidate these joint ventures in accordance with ASC 810 as they are VIEs in which we hold a variable interest, and we control decisions that are significant to the joint ventures' ongoing operations and economic results (i.e., we are the primary beneficiary).\nThese joint ventures are subject to profit sharing arrangements in which the allocation of the joint ventures' cash distributions and tax benefits to members is based on factors other than members' relative ownership percentages. As such, we utilize the HLBV method to allocate proceeds to each partner at the balance sheet date based on the liquidation provisions of the related joint venture's operating agreement and adjusts the amount of the VIE's net income attributable to us and the noncontrolling tax equity member during the period.\nIn each reporting period, the application of HLBV to our consolidated VIEs results in a difference between the amount of profit from the consolidated joint ventures and the amount included in regulated rates. As discussed above in \"F. Basis of Accounting for Rate-Regulated Subsidiaries,\" we are subject to the accounting and reporting requirements of ASC 980. In accordance with these principles, we recognize a regulatory liability or asset for amounts representing the timing difference between the profit earned from the joint ventures and the amount included in regulated rates to recover our approved investments in consolidated joint ventures. The amounts recorded in income will ultimately reflect the amount allowed in regulated rates to recover our investments over the useful life of the projects. The offset to the regulatory liability or asset associated with our renewable investments included in regulated rates is recorded in \"Depreciation expense\" on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).\n2.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of certain ASUs on our Consolidated Financial Statements and Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which are described below:\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued\nASU 2020-04\n,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\nand in January 2021, the FASB issued\nASU 2021-01\n,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Scope.\nThese pronouncements provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP principles to contract modifications and hedging relationships to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. These pronouncements are effective upon issuance on March 12, 2020, and will apply through December 31, 2022. We have evaluated the temporary expedients and options available under this guidance and identified the financial instruments to which the expedients could be applied, if deemed necessary.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have not applied any expedients and options available under these ASUs\n.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued\nASU 2021-10\n,\nGovernment Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\n. This pronouncement requires business entities to provide certain disclosures when they have received government assistance and use a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. This\n71\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\npronouncement is applicable for financial statements issued for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021.\nWe are currently evaluating the impact of adoption, if any, on the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued\nASU 2020-06\n,\nDebt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivative and Hedging - Contracts in Entity's Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity's Own Equity.\nThis pronouncement simplifies the accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity, including convertible instruments and contracts on an entity's own equity. Specifically, the ASU \"simplifies accounting for convertible instruments by removing major separation models required under current GAAP.\" In addition, the ASU \"removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for it\" and \"simplifies the diluted earnings per share (EPS) calculations in certain areas.\" Finally, this ASU \"eliminates the cash conversion and beneficial conversion feature models that require an issuer of certain convertible debt and preferred stock to separately account for embedded conversion features as a component of equity.\" This pronouncement is effective for the annual period beginning after\nDecember 15, 2021\n, and interim periods within those fiscal years. This accounting pronouncement will impact the denominator in the calculation of diluted EPS for our Equity Units. Beginning Q1 2022, we will be required to assume share settlement of the remaining purchase contract payment balance when applying the if-converted method. Moreover, we will also be required to utilize the average share price for the period instead of the end of period price.\nWe have adopted this ASU on its effective date\n.\n3.\nRevenue Recognition\nCustomer Revenues.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are tariff-based. Under ASC 606, the recipients of our utility service meet the definition of a customer, while the operating company tariffs represent an agreement that meets the definition of a contract, which creates enforceable rights and obligations. Customers in certain of our jurisdictions participate in programs that allow for a fixed payment each month regardless of usage. Payments received that exceed the value of gas or electricity actually delivered are recorded as a liability and presented in \"Customer Deposits and Credits\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Amounts in this account are reduced and revenue is recorded when customer usage exceeds payments received.\nWe have identified our performance obligations created under tariff-based sales as 1) the commodity (natural gas or electricity, which includes generation and capacity) and 2) delivery. These commodities are sold and / or delivered to and generally consumed by customers simultaneously, leading to satisfaction of our performance obligations over time as gas or electricity is delivered to customers. Due to the at-will nature of utility customers, performance obligations are limited to the services requested and received to date. Once complete, we generally maintain no additional performance obligations.\nTransaction prices for each performance obligation are generally prescribed by each operating company’s respective tariff. Rates include provisions to adjust billings for fluctuations in fuel and purchased power costs and cost of natural gas. Revenues are adjusted for differences between actual costs, subject to reconciliation, and the amounts billed in current rates. Under or over recovered revenues related to these cost recovery mechanisms are included in \"Regulatory Assets\" or \"Regulatory Liabilities\" on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are recovered from or returned to customers through adjustments to tariff rates. As we provide and deliver service to customers, revenue is recognized based on the transaction price allocated to each performance obligation. Distribution revenues are generally considered daily or \"at-will\" contracts as customers may cancel their service at any time (subject to notification requirements), and revenue generally represents the amount we are entitled to bill customers.\nIn addition to tariff-based sales, our Gas Distribution Operations segment enters into balancing and exchange arrangements of natural gas as part of our operations and off-system sales programs. Performance obligations for these types of sales include transportation and storage of natural gas and can be satisfied at a point in time or over a period of time, depending on the specific transaction. For those transactions that span a period of time, we record a receivable or payable for any cumulative gas imbalances, as well as for any gas inventory borrowed or lent under a Gas Distributions Operations exchange agreement.\nRevenue Disaggregation and Reconciliation.\nWe disaggregate revenue from contracts with customers based upon reportable segment as well as by customer class. The Gas Distribution Operations segment provides natural gas service and transportation for residential, commercial and industrial customers in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, Kentucky, Maryland and Indiana. The Electric Operations segment provides electric service in\n20\ncounties in the northern part of Indiana.\n72\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nThe tables below reconcile revenue disaggregation by customer class to segment revenue as well as to revenues reflected on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss):\n(1)\nCustomer revenue amounts exclude intersegment revenues.

See Note 23, \"Segments of Business,\" for discussion of intersegment revenues.\nOther Revenues.\nAs permitted by accounting principles generally accepted in the United States, regulated utilities have the ability to earn certain types of revenue that are outside the scope of ASC 606. These revenues primarily represent revenue earned under alternative revenue programs. Alternative revenue programs represent regulator-approved mechanisms that allow for the adjustment of billings and revenue for certain approved programs. We maintain a variety of these programs, including demand side management initiatives that recover costs associated with the implementation of energy efficiency programs, as\n73\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nwell as normalization programs that adjust revenues for the effects of weather or other external factors. Additionally, we maintain certain programs with future test periods that operate similarly to FERC formula rate programs and allow for recovery of costs incurred to replace aging infrastructure. When the criteria to recognize alternative revenue have been met, we establish a regulatory asset and present revenue from alternative revenue programs on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) as “Other revenues.” When amounts previously recognized under alternative revenue accounting guidance are billed, we reduce the regulatory asset and record a customer account receivable.\nCustomer Accounts Receivable.\nAccounts receivable on our Consolidated Balance Sheets includes both billed and unbilled amounts, as well as certain amounts that are not related to customer revenues. Unbilled amounts of accounts receivable relate to a portion of a customer’s consumption of gas or electricity from the date of the last cycle billing through the last day of the month (balance sheet date). Factors taken into consideration when estimating unbilled revenue include historical usage, customer rates and weather. A significant portion of our operations are subject to seasonal fluctuations in sales. During the heating season, primarily from November through March, revenues and receivables from gas sales are more significant than in other months.\nThe opening and closing balances of customer receivables for the year ended December 31, 2021, are presented in the table below. We had no significant contract assets or liabilities during the period. Additionally, we have not incurred any significant costs to obtain or fulfill contracts.\nUtility revenues are billed to customers monthly on a cycle basis. We expect that substantially all customer accounts receivable will be collected following customer billing, as this revenue consists primarily of periodic, tariff-based billings for service and usage. We maintain common utility credit risk mitigation practices, including requiring deposits and actively pursuing collection of past due amounts. Our regulated operations also utilize certain regulatory mechanisms that facilitate recovery of bad debt costs within tariff-based rates, which provides further evidence of collectibility.  It is probable that substantially all of the consideration to which we are entitled from customers will be collected upon satisfaction of performance obligations.\nAllowance for Credit Losses.\nTo evaluate for expected credit losses, customer account receivables are pooled based on similar risk characteristics, such as customer type, geography, payment terms, and related macro-economic risks. Expected credit losses are established using a model that considers historical collections experience, current information, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Internal and external inputs are used in our credit model including, but not limited to, energy consumption trends, revenue projections, actual charge-offs data, recoveries data, shut-offs, customer delinquencies, and final bill data. We continuously evaluate available information relevant to assessing collectability of current and future receivables. We evaluate creditworthiness of specific customers periodically or  following changes in facts and circumstances. When we become aware of a specific commercial or industrial customer's inability to pay, an allowance for expected credit losses is recorded for the relevant amount. We also monitor other circumstances that could affect our overall expected credit losses; including, but not limited to, creditworthiness of overall population in service territories, adverse conditions impacting an industry sector, and current economic conditions.\n74\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nAt each reporting period, we record expected credit losses to an allowance for credit losses account. When deemed to be uncollectible, customer accounts are written-off.\nA rollforward of our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,  are presented in the tables below:\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, certain state regulatory commissions instituted regulatory moratoriums that impacted our ability to pursue our standard credit risk mitigation practices. Following the issuance of these moratoriums, certain of our regulated operations have been authorized to recognize a regulatory asset for bad debt costs above levels currently recovered in rates. At the balance sheet date, in addition to our evaluation of the allowance for credit losses discussed above, we considered benefits available under governmental COVID-19 relief programs, the impact of unemployment benefits initiatives, and flexible payment plans being offered to customers affected by or experiencing hardship as a result of the pandemic, which could help to mitigate the potential for increasing customer account delinquencies. We also considered the on-time bill payment promotion and robust customer marketing strategy for energy assistance programs that we have implemented. Based upon this evaluation, we have concluded that the allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 adequately reflected the collection risk and net realizable value of our receivables. We have now resumed our common credit mitigation practices in all jurisdictions as these moratoriums have expired (see Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information on regulatory moratoriums and regulatory assets).\n4.\nVariable Interest Entities\nA VIE is an entity in which the controlling interest is determined through means other than a majority voting interest. Refer to Note 1-S, \"VIEs and Allocation of Earnings,\" for information on our accounting policy for the VIEs.\nWe control decisions that are significant to Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads Wind's ongoing operations and economic results. Therefore, we have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary and have consolidated both.\nMembers of the respective joint ventures are NIPSCO (who is the managing member) and tax equity partners. Earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated to both NIPSCO and the tax equity partner in varying percentages by category and over the life of the partnership.  Once the tax equity partner has earned their negotiated rate of return and we have reached the agreed upon contractual date, NIPSCO has the option to purchase at fair market value from the tax equity partner the remaining interest in the respective joint venture. NIPSCO has an obligation to purchase, through a PPA at established market rates,\n100\n% of the electricity generated by the joint ventures.\nRosewater\nRosewater owns and operates\n102\nMW of nameplate capacity wind generation assets.

The creditors of the liabilities of Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads do not have recourse to the general credit of the primary beneficiary.\n5.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe calculations of basic and diluted EPS are based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock and potential common stock outstanding during the period. For the purposes of determining diluted EPS, the shares underlying the purchase contracts included within the Equity Units were included in the calculation of potential common stock outstanding for the year ended December 31, 2021 using the if-converted method under US GAAP. This method assumes conversion at the beginning of the reporting period, or at time of issuance, if later. For the purchase contracts, the number of shares of our common stock that would be issuable at the end of each reporting period will be reflected in the denominator of our diluted EPS calculation. If the stock price falls below the initial reference price of $\n24.51\n, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock used in calculating diluted EPS will be the maximum number of shares per the contract as described in Note 13, \"Equity.\" Conversely, if the stock price is above the initial reference price of $\n24.51\n, subject to anti-dilution adjustments, a variable number of shares of our common stock will be used in calculating diluted EPS. A numerator adjustment was reflected in the calculation of diluted EPS for interest expense incurred in 2021, net of tax, related to the purchase contracts.\nThe shares underlying the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock included within the Equity Units are contingently convertible as the conversion is contingent on a successful remarketing as described in Note 13, \"Equity.\" Contingently convertible shares where conversion is not tied to a market price trigger are excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS until such time as the contingency has been resolved under the if-converted method. As of December 31, 2021, the contingency was not resolved and thus no shares were reflected in the denominator in the calculation of diluted EPS for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDiluted EPS also includes the incremental effects of the various long-term incentive compensation plans and the open ATM forward agreements during the period under the treasury stock method when the impact would be dilutive.

Refer to Note 4, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" for additional information.\n(3)\nNon-Utility and Other as of December 31, 2020 includes net book value of four coal units totaling $\n903.8\nmillion related to R.M. Schahfer Generating Station. Two of the four units were subsequently retired in 2021 and reclassified to current and long-term Regulatory Assets. Depreciation expense for the remaining net book value continues to be recorded at the composite depreciation rate approved by the IURC. As of December 31, 2021, Non-Utility and Other includes a net book value of $\n201.5\nmillion related to the units not yet retired.\nOn October 1, 2021, NIPSCO retired R.M. Schahfer Generating Station Units 14 and 15. The net book value of the retired units was reclassified from \"Net Property, Plant and Equipment,\" to current and long-term ''Regulatory Assets.'' The estimated net book value of R.M. Schahfer Generating Station's coal Units 14 and 15 and other associated plant retired was approximately $\n600.0\nmillion. See Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional details regarding the recovery of the regulatory assets associated with retired generating stations.\nThe weighted average depreciation provisions for utility plant, as a percentage of the original cost, for the periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(1)\nIncreased rate beginning in 2020 primarily attributable to higher depreciation rates from the recent rate case proceeding.\nWe recognized depreciation expense of $\n672.1\nmillion, $\n655.6\nmillion and $\n612.2\nmillion for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2021 depreciation expense amount includes a $\n5.3\nmillion credit related to the regulatory deferral of income (loss) associated with our joint ventures, which is not included in current rates. See Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional details.\nAmortization of on-premise Software Costs.\nWe amortized $\n49.4\nmillion, $\n56.7\nmillion and $\n55.5\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to software recorded as intangible assets. Our unamortized software balance was $\n181.8\nmillion and $\n136.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n79\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

Our unamortized cloud computing balance was $\n42.4\nmillion  and $\n12.7\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n7.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill.\nSubstantially all of our goodwill relates to the excess of cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired in the Columbia acquisition on November 1, 2000. Our goodwill balance was $\n1,485.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. All our goodwill has been allocated to our Gas Distribution Operations segment.\nFor our annual goodwill impairment analysis performed as of May 1, 2021, we completed a qualitative \"step 0\" assessment and determined that it was more likely than not that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit substantially exceeded the related carrying value of our reporting unit. For this test, we assessed various assumptions, events and circumstances that would have affected the estimated fair value of the reporting units as compared to their baseline May 1, 2020 \"step 1\" fair value measurement.\nColumbia of Massachusetts was not considered to be a reporting unit for May 1, 2020 fair value measurement as the goodwill balance had been reduced to\nzero\nas of December 31, 2019. During the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed the matters related to the then proposed sale of the Massachusetts Business and determined a new impairment analysis was required for our Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit. Fair value of this reporting unit was determined based on a weighting of income and market approaches. The income approach calculated discounted cash flows using updated cash flow projections, discount rates and return on equity assumptions. The market approach applied a combination of comparable company multiples and comparable transactions and used the most recent cash flow projections. The 2019 year-end impairment analysis indicated that the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit was below its carrying value. As a result, we reduced the Columbia of Massachusetts reporting unit goodwill balance to\nzero\nand recognized a goodwill impairment charge totaling $\n204.8\nmillion, which was non-deductible for tax purposes.\nIntangible and Other Long-Lived Assets Impairment.\nPrior to December 31, 2019, our intangible assets, apart from goodwill, consisted of franchise rights identified as part of the purchase price allocations associated with the acquisition in February 1999 of Columbia of Massachusetts.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, in connection with the preparation of the year-end financial statements, we assessed the changes in circumstances that occurred during the quarter to determine if it was more likely than not that the fair value of our long-lived assets (including franchise rights) were below their carrying amount. As a result, we performed a year-end impairment test of our held and used long-lived assets in which we compared the book value of the Columbia of Massachusetts asset group to its undiscounted future cash flow and determined the carrying value of the asset group was not recoverable. We estimated the fair value of the Columbia of Massachusetts asset group using a weighting of income and market approaches and determined that the fair value was less than the carrying value. The resulting impairment was allocated to reduce the entire franchise rights book value to its fair value of zero, which resulted in an impairment charge totaling $\n209.7\nmillion recorded in the Gas Distribution Operations segment during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying amount of the franchise rights was\nzero\n. We recorded\nzero\namortization expense in 2021 and 2020 and $\n11.0\nmillion in 2019 related to our franchise rights intangible asset.\n8.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nWe have recognized asset retirement obligations associated with various legal obligations including costs to remove and dispose of certain construction materials located within many of our facilities (including our joint venture facilities), certain costs to retire pipeline, removal costs for certain underground storage tanks, removal of certain pipelines known to contain PCB contamination, closure costs for certain sites including ash ponds, solid waste management units and a landfill, as well as some other nominal asset retirement obligations. We also have an obligation associated with the decommissioning of our two hydro facilities located in Indiana.

Pursuant to that order, Pennsylvania utilities are required to offer payment plans on billing arrearages, with the length of such payment plans depending on a customer's income level. Pursuant to a subsequent order, Pennsylvania utilities were no longer required to offer these extended pandemic-related payment arrangements to customers in arrears as of October 1, 2021.On December 16, 2021, CPA received a final order approving its 2021 base rate case, which includes a provision to discontinue the deferral of COVID-19 uncollectible accounts as of December 29, 2021 and begin recovery of amounts deferred as of 12/31/2020 over a five year period beginning on January 1, 2022.\nFor Columbia of Virginia, the moratorium on non-residential disconnections ended on October 6, 2020, and the moratorium on residential disconnections and late payment fees ended on August 30, 2021.

Some of our utility subsidiaries offer programs whereby variability in the market price of gas is assumed by the respective utility. The objective of our commodity price risk programs is to mitigate the gas cost variability, for us or on behalf of our customers, associated with natural gas purchases or sales by economically hedging the various gas cost components using a combination of futures, options, forwards or other derivative contracts. At December 31, 2021, we had\n124.5\nMMDth of net energy derivative volumes outstanding related to our natural gas hedges.\nNIPSCO has received IURC approval to lock in a fixed price for its natural gas customers using long-term forward purchase instruments and is limited to\n20\n% of NIPSCO’s average annual GCA purchase volume. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining terms of these instruments range from\none\nto\nsix\nyears.\nAll gains and losses on these derivative contracts are deferred as regulatory liabilities or assets and are remitted to or collected from customers through NIPSCO’s quarterly GCA and FAC mechanisms, respectively. These instruments are not designated as accounting hedges. Refer to Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional information.\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nInterest rate risk management.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have two forward-starting interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value totaling $\n500.0\nmillion to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with forecasted debt issuances. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges.\nCash flow hedges included in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were:\n(1)\nAll amounts are net of tax.\nThe actual amounts reclassified from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss) to Net Income can differ from the estimate above due to market price changes.\n85\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nThe gains and losses related to these swaps are recorded to AOCI. Upon issuance, we amortize the gains and losses over the life of the debt associated with these swaps as we recognize interest expense. These amounts are immaterial in 2021,  2020 and 2019 and are recorded in \"Interest expense, net\" on the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).\nIf it becomes probable that a hedged forecasted transaction will no longer occur, the accumulated gains or losses on the derivative will be recognized currently in \"Other, net\" in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss).\nThere were\nno\namounts excluded from effectiveness testing for derivatives in cash flow hedging relationships at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nOur derivative instruments measured at fair value as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 do not contain any credit-risk-related contingent features. Cash flows for derivative financial instruments are generally classified in cash flows from operating activities.\n11.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome Tax Expense.\nThe components of income tax expense (benefit) were as follows:\n86\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nStatutory Rate Reconciliation.\nThe following table represents a reconciliation of income tax expense at the statutory federal income tax rate to the actual income tax expense from continuing operations:\nThe difference in tax expense year-over-year has a relative impact on the effective tax rate proportional to pretax income or loss. The\n37.9\n% decrease in effective tax rate in 2021 versus 2020 was primarily the result of higher pre-tax income, state jurisdictional mix of pre-tax income in 2021 tax effected at statutory tax rates and increased amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes in 2021 compared to 2020. These items were offset by decreased deferred tax expense recognized on the sale of Columbia of Massachusetts' regulatory liability in 2020, established due to TCJA in 2017, that would have otherwise been recognized over the amortization period, 2020 non-deductible penalties and valuation allowance related to Columbia of Massachusetts  and 2020 one-time tax accrual adjustments.\nThe\n30.2\n% increase in effective tax rate in 2020 versus 2019 was primarily the result of lower pre-tax income, state jurisdictional mix of pre-tax loss in 2020 tax effected at statutory tax rates and increased amortization of excess deferred federal income taxes in 2020 compared to 2019. These items were offset by increased deferred tax expense recognized on the sale of Columbia of Massachusetts' regulatory liability, established due to TCJA in 2017, that would have otherwise been recognized over the amortization period, non-deductible penalties and non-cash impairment of goodwill related to Columbia of Massachusetts in 2019 (see Note 7, \"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets\" for additional information), and one-time tax accrual adjustments.\n87\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nNet Deferred Income Tax Liability Components.\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities. The principal components of our net deferred tax liability were as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, we have federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n464.4\nmillion (tax effected). The federal net operating loss carryforwards are available to offset taxable income and will begin to expire in 2036.  We believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefit from the federal net operating loss carryforwards.\nWe also have $\n73.7\nmillion (tax effected, net of federal benefit) of state net operating loss carryforwards. Depending on the jurisdiction in which the state net operating loss was generated, the carryforwards will begin to expire in 2028.\nWe believe it is more likely than not that a portion of the benefit from certain state NOL carryforwards will not be realized. In recognition of this risk, we have provided a valuation allowance of $\n7.8\nmillion (net) on the deferred tax assets related to sale of Massachusetts Business assets reflected in the state net operating loss carryforward presented above.\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nWe present accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits, accrued interest on other income tax liabilities and tax penalties in \"Income Taxes\" on our Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss). Interest expense recorded on unrecognized tax benefits and other income tax liabilities was immaterial for all periods presented. There were\nno\naccruals for penalties recorded in the Statements of Consolidated Income (Loss) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and there were\nno\nbalances for accrued penalties recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nWe are subject to income taxation in the United States and various state jurisdictions, primarily Indiana, Pennsylvania, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Maryland and Virginia.\n88\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nWe participate in the IRS CAP, which provides the opportunity to resolve tax matters with the IRS before filing each year's consolidated federal income tax return. As of December 31, 2021, tax years through 2020 have been audited and are effectively closed to further assessment. The audit of tax year 2021 under the CAP program is expected to be completed in 2022.\nThe statute of limitations in each of the state jurisdictions in which we operate remains open between 3-4 years from the date the state income tax returns are filed. As of December 31, 2021, there were no state income tax audits in progress that would have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\n12.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nWe provide defined contribution plans and noncontributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain of our employees. Benefits under the defined benefit retirement plans reflect the employees’ compensation, years of service and age at retirement. Additionally, we provide health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees. The majority of employees may become eligible for these benefits if they reach retirement age while working for us. The expected cost of such benefits is accrued during the employees’ years of service. Current rates of rate-regulated companies include postretirement benefit costs, including amortization of the regulatory assets that arose prior to inclusion of these costs in rates. For most plans, cash contributions are remitted to grantor trusts.\nOur Pension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans’ Asset Management\n. The Board has delegated oversight of the pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets to the NiSource Benefits Committee (“the Committee”). The Committee has adopted investment policy statements for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans’ assets. For the pension plans, we employ a liability-driven investing strategy. A total return approach is utilized for the other postretirement benefit plans’ assets. A mix of diversified investments are used to maximize the long-term return of plan assets and hedge the liabilities at a prudent level of risk. The investment portfolio includes U.S. and non-U.S. equities, real estate, long-term and intermediate-term fixed income and alternative investments. Risk tolerance is established through careful consideration of plan liabilities, funded status, and asset class volatility. Investment risk is measured and monitored on an ongoing basis through quarterly investment portfolio reviews, annual liability measurements, and periodic asset/liability studies.\nIn determining the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, historical markets are studied, relationships between equities and fixed income are analyzed and current market factors, such as inflation and interest rates are evaluated with consideration of diversification and rebalancing. Our expected long-term rate of return on assets is based on assumptions regarding target asset allocations and corresponding long-term capital market assumptions for each asset class. The pension plans’ investment policy calls for a gradual reduction in the allocation of return-seeking assets (equities, real estate and private equity) and a corresponding increase in the allocation of liability-hedging assets (fixed income) as the funded status of the plans’ increase.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the acceptable minimum and maximum ranges established by the policy for the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are as follows:\n89\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

Assets are classified in their entirety based on the observability of inputs used in determining the fair value measurement. There were no investment assets in the pension and other postretirement benefits trusts classified within Level 3 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n90\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nWe use the following valuation techniques  to determine fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no significant changes to valuation techniques to determine the fair value of our pension and other postretirement benefits' assets.\nLevel 1 Measurements\nMost common and preferred stocks are traded in active markets on national and international securities exchanges and are valued at closing prices on the last business day of each period presented. Cash is stated at cost, which approximates fair value, with the exception of cash held in foreign currencies which fluctuates with changes in the exchange rates. Short-term bills and notes are priced based on quoted market values.\nLevel 2 Measurements\nMost U.S. Government Agency obligations, mortgage/asset-backed securities, and corporate fixed income securities are generally valued by benchmarking model-derived prices to quoted market prices and trade data for identical or comparable securities. To the extent that quoted prices are not available, fair value is determined based on a valuation model that includes inputs such as interest rate yield curves and credit spreads. Securities traded in markets that are not considered active are valued based on quoted market prices, broker or dealer quotations, or alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency.  Other fixed income includes futures and options which are priced on bid valuation or settlement pricing.\nLevel 3 Measurements\nInvestments with unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets and liabilities are classified as level 3 investments.\nNot Classified\nCommingled funds, private equity limited partnerships and real estate partnerships are not classified within the fair value hierarchy. Instead, these assets are measured at estimated fair value using the net asset value per share of the investments. Commingled funds' underlying assets are principally marketable equity and fixed income securities. Units held in commingled funds are valued at the unit value as reported by the investment managers. Private equity and real estate funds invest in natural resources, commercial real estate and distressed real estate.  The fair value of these investments is determined by reference to the funds’ underlying assets.\n91\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

The postretirement benefit gain was also primarily driven by an increase in discount rates.\n(3)\nWe recognize our Consolidated Balance Sheets underfunded and overfunded status of our various defined benefit postretirement plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation.\n(4)\nWe determined that for certain rate-regulated subsidiaries the future recovery of pension and other postretirement benefits costs is probable. These rate-regulated subsidiaries recorded regulatory assets and liabilities of $\n512.1\nmillion and\nzero\n, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and $\n583.3\nmillion and\nzero\n, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 that would otherwise have been recorded to accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nOur accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans was $\n1,834.4\nmillion and $\n2,036.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation at each date is the actuarial present value of benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula to employee service rendered prior to that date and based on current and past compensation levels. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation disclosed in the table above in that it includes no assumptions about future compensation levels.\nWe are required to reflect the funded status of our pension and postretirement benefit plans on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets' fair value and the projected benefit obligation.

The improvement in the funded status was due primarily to favorable asset returns. We contributed $\n4.0\nmillion and $\n2.9\nmillion to our pension plans in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur other postretirement benefit plans were underfunded by $\n262.5\nmillion at December 31, 2021 compared to being underfunded by $\n304.4\nmillion at December 31, 2020. The improvement in funded status was primarily due to employer contributions and increased discount rates. We contributed $\n19.8\nmillion and $\n21.6\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plans in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn 2021 and 2020, some of our qualified pension plans paid lump sum payouts in excess of the respective plan's service cost plus interest cost, thereby meeting the requirement for settlement accounting. We recorded settlement charges of $\n11.4\nmillion and $\n10.5\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.

On and after March 15, 2024, dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock will accumulate for each five year period at a percentage of the $\n25,000\nliquidation preference equal to the five-year U.S. Treasury Rate plus (i) in respect of each five year period commencing on or after March 15, 2024 but before March 15, 2044, a spread of\n3.632\n% (the “Initial Margin”), and (ii) in respect of each five year period commencing on or after March 15, 2044, the Initial Margin plus\n1.000\n%. The Series B Preferred Stock may be redeemed by us at our option on March 15, 2024, or on each date falling on the fifth anniversary thereafter, or in connection with a ratings event (as defined in the Certificate of Designation of the Series B Preferred Stock).\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Series B Preferred Stock had $\n1.4\nmillion of cumulative preferred dividends in arrears, or $\n72.23\nper share.\nIn addition,\n20,000\nshares of Series B–1 Preferred Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, were outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Holders of Series B–1 Preferred Stock are not entitled to receive dividend payments and have no conversion rights. The Series B–1 Preferred Stock is paired with the Series B Preferred Stock and may not be transferred, redeemed or repurchased except in connection with the simultaneous transfer, redemption or repurchase of the underlying Series B Preferred Stock.\nHolders of Series B Preferred Stock generally have no voting rights, except for limited voting rights with respect to (i) potential amendments to our certificate of incorporation that would have a material adverse effect on the existing preferences, rights, powers or duties of the Series B Preferred Stock, (ii) the creation or issuance of any security ranking on a parity with the Series B Preferred Stock if the cumulative dividends payable on then outstanding Series B Preferred Stock are in arrears, or (iii) the creation or issuance of any security ranking senior to the Series B Preferred Stock. In addition, if and whenever dividends on any shares of Series B Preferred Stock shall not have been declared and paid for at least six dividend periods, whether or not consecutive, the number of directors then constituting our Board of Directors shall automatically be increased by two until all accumulated and unpaid dividends on the Series B Preferred Stock shall have been paid in full, and the holders of Series B-1 Preferred Stock, voting as a class together with the holders of any outstanding securities ranking on a parity with the Series B-1 Preferred Stock and having like voting rights that are exercisable at the time and entitled to vote thereon, shall be entitled to elect the two additional directors. The Series B Preferred Stock does not have a stated maturity and is not subject to mandatory redemption or any sinking fund. The Series B Preferred Stock will remain outstanding indefinitely unless repurchased or redeemed by us. Any such redemption would be effected only out of funds legally available for such purposes and will be subject to compliance with the provisions of our outstanding indebtedness.\n101\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nThe following table summarizes preferred stock by outstanding series of shares:\n(1)\nThe Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock initially will not bear any dividends. We recorded the initial present value of the purchase contract payments as a liability with a corresponding reduction to preferred stock.\nEquity Units.\nOn April 19, 2021, we completed the sale of\n8.625\nmillion Equity Units, initially consisting of Corporate Units, each with a stated amount of $\n100\n. The offering generated net proceeds of $\n835.5\nmillion, after underwriting and issuance expenses. Each Corporate Unit consists of a forward contract to purchase shares of our common stock in the future and a 1/10th, or\n10\n%, undivided beneficial ownership interest in one share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share.\nThe purchase contract obligates holders to purchase shares of our common stock on December 1, 2023, subject to early settlement in certain situations.\nThe purchase price paid under the purchase contract is $\n100\nand the number of shares to be purchased will be determined under a settlement rate formula based on the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock near the settlement date, subject to a maximum settlement rate. The Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will initially be pledged upon issuance as collateral to secure the purchase of common stock under the related purchase contracts.\nWe will pay quarterly contract adjustment payments at the rate of\n7.75\n% per year on the stated amount of $\n100\nper Equity Unit.  The contract adjustment payments are payable in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.  We have the right to defer the payment of contract adjustment payments until no later than the purchase contract settlement date. If we exercise our option to defer the payment of contract adjustment payments, then until the deferred contract adjustment payments have been paid, we will not declare or pay any dividends on, or make any distributions on, or redeem, purchase or acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any shares of our capital stock; make any payment of principal of, or interest or premium, if any, on, or repay, repurchase or redeem any of our debt securities that rank on parity with, or junior to, the contract adjustment payments; or make any guarantee payments under any guarantee by us of securities of any of our subsidiaries if our guarantee ranks on parity with, or junior to, the contract adjustment payments.\nThe Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock initially will not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the mandatory convertible preferred stock will not accrete. The Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is expected to be remarketed prior to December 1, 2023.  Following a successful remarketing, dividends may become payable on the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and/or the minimum conversion rate of the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock may be increased. Each share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, unless previously converted, will automatically convert based on a conversion rate on the mandatory conversion date, which is expected to be on or about March 1, 2024. The conversion rate will be determined based on the volume-weighted average share price of our common stock near the conversion date, subject to a minimum and maximum conversion rate. If no successful remarketing of the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock has previously occurred, effective as of December 1, 2023, the conversion rate will be zero, no shares of our common stock will be delivered upon automatic conversion and each share of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will be automatically transferred to us on the mandatory conversion date without any payment of cash or shares of our common stock thereon. In the event of such a remarketing failure, any shares of Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock held as part of Corporate Units will be automatically delivered to us on December 1, 2023 in full satisfaction of the relevant holder's obligation under the related purchase contracts.\nThe Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock and forward purchase contracts are legally detachable and separately exercisable, however, due to the economic linkage between the forward purchase contract and the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, we have concluded that the ability to separate the Corporate Units is non-substantive. Accordingly, we are accounting for the Corporate Units as a single unit of account.  We recorded the initial present value of the purchase contract payments as a liability with a corresponding reduction to preferred stock. The current portion of this liability\n102\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

Purchase contract payments are recorded against this liability. Accretion of the stock purchase contract liability is recorded as interest expense. Refer to Note 5,\n\"Earnings Per Share,\" for additional information regarding our application of diluted EPS to the shares underlying purchase contracts and the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock as part of the Equity Units. Under the terms of the Equity Units, assuming no anti-dilution or other adjustments such as a fundamental change, the maximum number of shares of common stock we will issue under the purchase contracts is\n35.2\nmillion and maximum number of shares of common stock we will issue under the Series C Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is\n35.2\nmillion.\nSelected information about the Equity Units is presented below:\n(1)\nIssuance costs of $\n27.0\nmillion were recorded on a relative fair value basis as a reduction to preferred stock of $\n22.5\nmillion and a reduction to the purchase contract liability of $\n4.5\nmillion.\n(2)\nCash payments of $\n41.2\nmillion and\nzero\nwere made during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.  The purchase contract liability was $\n129.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021.\nNoncontrolling Interest in Consolidated Subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, NIPSCO and tax equity partners have completed their cash contributions into the Indiana Crossroads Wind and Rosewater joint ventures. Earnings, tax attributes and cash flows are allocated to both NIPSCO and the respective tax equity partners in varying percentages by category and over the life of the partnership. The tax equity partner's contributions, net of these allocations, is represented as a noncontrolling interest within total equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Refer to Note 4, \"Variable Interest Entities,\" for more information.\n14.\nShare-Based Compensation\nPrior to May 19, 2020 we issued share-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors under the NiSource Inc. 2010 Omnibus Plan (\"2010 Omnibus Plan\"), which was most recently approved by stockholders at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 12, 2015. The 2010 Omnibus Plan provided for awards to employees and non-employee directors of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards and superseded the Director Stock Incentive Plan (“Director Plan”) with respect to grants made after the effective date of the 2010 Omnibus Plan.\nThe stockholders approved and adopted the NiSource Inc. 2020 Omnibus Incentive Plan (\"2020 Omnibus Plan\") at the Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on May 19, 2020. The 2020 Omnibus Plan provides for awards to employees and non-employee directors of incentive and nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, performance units, cash-based awards and other stock-based awards and supersedes the 2010 Omnibus Plan with respect to grants made after the effective date of the 2020 Omnibus Plan.\nThe 2020 Omnibus Plan provides that the number of shares of common stock of NiSource available for awards is\n10,000,000\nplus the number of shares subject to outstanding awards that expire or terminate for any reason that were granted under the 2020 Omnibus Plan, the 2010 Omnibus Plan or any other equity plan under which awards were outstanding as of May 19, 2020. At December 31, 2021, there were\n9,081,947\nshares available for future awards under the 2020 Omnibus Plan.\nWe recognized stock-based employee compensation expense of $\n16.7\nmillion, $\n13.5\nmillion and $\n16.3\nmillion, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $\n4.0\nmillion, $\n3.3\nmillion and $\n4.0\nmillion, respectively. We recognized related excess tax expense from the distribution of vested share-based employee compensation of $\n0.4\nmillion in 2020, and excess tax benefits of $\n0.4\nmillion and $\n0.8\nmillion in 2021 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total remaining unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested awards amounted to $\n25.1\nmillion, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service period of\n1.8\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Units and Restricted Stock\n. We granted\n285,755\n,\n235,100\n, and\n166,031\nrestricted stock units and shares of restricted stock to employees, subject to service conditions in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The total grant date fair value of the restricted stock units and shares of restricted stock during 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, was $\n5.7\nmillion, $\n6.1\nmillion, and $\n4.1\nmillion based on the average market price of our common stock at the date of each grant less the present value\n103\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

In the event of a change in control (as defined in the award agreement), all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded will immediately vest upon termination of employment occurring in connection with a change in control. Termination due to any other reason will result in all unvested shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units awarded being forfeited effective on the employee’s date of termination.\nA summary of our restricted stock unit award transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nEmployee Performance Shares\n. We granted\n973,885\nperformance shares subject to service, performance and/or market-based vesting conditions in 2021. In regards to\n390,941\nperformance shares granted, the performance conditions are based on the achievement of relative total shareholder return. The number of shares that are eligible to vest based on the Company's relative total shareholder return performance will be adjusted based on a performance magnifier related to safety. In regards to remaining\n582,944\nperformance shares granted, the performance conditions are based on the achievement of one non-GAAP financial measure and/or achievement of relative total shareholder return. The number of shares that are eligible to vest based on these performance conditions will be adjusted based on performance of the magnifier framework for 2021 awards, outlined below.\nThe financial measure is cumulative net operating earnings per share (\"NOEPS\"), which we define as income from continuing operations adjusted for certain items. Relative total shareholder return, a market-based vesting condition, which we define as the annualized growth in dividends and share price of a share of our common stock (calculated using a 20 trading day average of our closing price over the performance period, approximately) compared to the total shareholder return of a predetermined peer group of companies. A relative shareholder return result within the first quartile will result in an increase to the NOEPS shares of\n25\n%, while a relative shareholder return result within the fourth quartile will result in a decrease of\n25\n%. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to value the portion of these awards dependent on the market-based vesting condition. The grant date fair value of the NOEPS shares is based on the closing stock price of our common stock at the date of each grant, which will be expensed over the requisite service period of\nthree years\n. See table below for further details on these awards.\nFor the 2021 awards, the magnifier framework consists of three areas of focus including safety, environment, and diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DE&I\"), representing 20%, 10% and 10%, respectively.\nWe granted\n528,729\nand\n552,389\nperformance shares subject to service, performance and market-based vesting conditions in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The performance conditions are based on the achievement of one non-GAAP financial measure, relative total shareholder return and additional operational measures as outlined below.\nThe financial measure is cumulative net operating earnings per share (\"NOEPS\"), which we define as income from continuing operations adjusted for certain items. The number of cumulative NOEPS shares determined using this measure shall be increased or decreased based on our relative total shareholder return, a market-based vesting condition, which we define as the annualized growth in dividends and share price of a share of our common stock (calculated using a 20 trading day average of our closing price over the performance period, approximately) compared to the total shareholder return of a predetermined peer\n104\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

A relative shareholder return result within the first quartile will result in an increase to the NOEPS shares of\n25\n%, while a relative shareholder return result within the fourth quartile will result in a decrease of\n25\n%. A Monte Carlo analysis was used to value the portion of these awards dependent on the market-based vesting condition. The grant date fair value of the NOEPS shares is based on the average market price of our common stock at the date of each grant less the present value of dividends not received during the vesting period, which will be expensed over the requisite service period of\nthree years\n. See table below for further details on these awards.\nIf a threshold level of cumulative NOEPS financial performance is achieved, additional operational measures, which we refer to as the customer value framework and which consists of equally weighted areas of focus, apply. Each area of focus represents an equal portion of the customer value framework shares, and the targets for all areas of focus must be met for the customer value framework shares to vest at 100%. The grant date fair value of the customer value framework shares is based on the average market price of our common stock on the grant date of each award less the present value of dividends not received during the vesting period, which will be expensed over the requisite service period of\nthree years\nfor those customer value framework shares that are granted. See table below for further details on these awards.\nFor the 2020 awards, the customer value framework consists of four equally weighted areas of focus including safety, customer satisfaction, culture and environmental, each representing 25% of the customer value framework shares. For the 2019 awards, the customer value framework consists of five equally weighted areas of focus including financial and all those noted for the 2020 awards, each representing 20% of the customer value framework shares.\nThe following table presents details of the performance awards described above.\nA summary of our performance award transactions for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n105\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nNon-employee Director Awards\n. As of May 19, 2020, awards to non-employee directors may be made only under the 2020 Omnibus Plan. Currently, restricted stock units are granted annually to non-employee directors, subject to a non-employee director’s election to defer receipt of such restricted stock unit award. The non-employee director’s annual award of restricted stock units vest on the first anniversary of the grant date subject to special pro-rata vesting rules in the event of retirement or disability (as defined in the award agreement), or death. The vested restricted stock units are payable as soon as practicable following vesting except as otherwise provided pursuant to the non-employee director’s deferral election. Certain restricted stock units remain outstanding from the 2010 Omnibus Plan and the Director Plan. All such awards are fully vested and shall be distributed to the directors upon their separation from the Board.\nAs of December 31, 2021,\n252,673\nrestricted stock units are outstanding to non-employee directors under either the 2020 Omnibus Plan, the 2010 Omnibus Plan or the Director Plan. Of this amount,\n66,273\nrestricted stock units are unvested and expected to vest.\n401(k) Match, Profit Sharing and Company Contribution.\nWe have a voluntary 401(k) savings plan covering eligible employees that allows for periodic discretionary matches as a percentage of each participant’s contributions payable in cash for nonunion employees and generally payable in shares of NiSource common stock for union employees, subject to collective bargaining. We also have a retirement savings plan that provides for discretionary profit sharing contributions similarly payable in cash or shares of NiSource common stock to eligible employees based on earnings results, and eligible employees hired after January 1, 2010 receive a non-elective company contribution of\n3\n% of eligible pay similarly payable in cash or shares of NiSource common stock.  For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized 401(k) match, profit sharing and non-elective contribution expense of $\n39.1\nmillion, $\n37.8\nmillion and $\n37.5\nmillion, respectively.\n106\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

Details of our 2020 long-term debt related activity are summarized below:\n•\nOn April 13, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $\n1.0\nbillion of\n3.60\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in  2030, which resulted in approximately $\n987.8\nmillion of net proceeds after deducting commissions and expenses.\n•\nOn August 18, 2020, we completed the issuance and sale of $\n1.25\nbillion of\n0.95\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2025 and $\n750.0\nmillion of\n1.70\n% senior unsecured notes maturing in 2031, which resulted in approximately $\n1,980.4\nmillion of net proceeds after deducting commissions and expenses.\n•\nIn August 2020, we executed tender offers for $\n969.3\nmillion of outstanding notes consisting of a combination of our\n4.45\n% notes due 2021,\n2.65\n% notes due 2022,\n3.85\n% notes due 2023,\n3.65\n% notes due 2023,\n6.25\n% notes due 2040, and\n5.95\n% notes due 2041. In August and September 2020, we redeemed $\n609.3\nmillion of outstanding notes representing the remainder of our\n4.45\n% notes due 2021,\n2.65\n% notes due 2022,\n3.85\n% notes due 2023, and\n3.65\n% notes due 2023 and all of our\n5.89\n% notes due 2025.

In conjunction with the debt retired, Columbia of Massachusetts recorded an $\n11.7\nmillion loss on early extinguishment of long-term debt, primarily attributable to early redemption premiums. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, Columbia of Massachusetts’ net working capital at the closing of the sale of the Massachusetts Business was increased by 50% of the debt extinguishment costs, which was approximately $\n5.3\nmillion.\nSee Note 19-A, \"Contractual Obligations,\" for the outstanding long-term debt maturities at December 31, 2021.\nUnamortized debt expense, premium and discount on long-term debt applicable to outstanding bonds are being amortized over the life of such bonds.\nWe are subject to a financial covenant under our revolving credit facility which requires us to maintain a debt to capitalization ratio that does not exceed\n70\n%. As of December 31, 2021, the ratio was\n57.4\n%.\nWe are also subject to certain other non-financial covenants under the revolving credit facility. Such covenants include a limitation on the creation or existence of new liens on our assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets equal to $\n200\nmillion. An asset sale covenant generally restricts the sale, conveyance, lease, transfer or other disposition of our assets to those dispositions that are for a price not materially less than fair market of such assets, that would not materially impair our ability to perform obligations under the revolving credit facility, and that together with all other such dispositions, would not have a material adverse effect.  The covenant also restricts dispositions to no more than\n15\n% of our consolidated total assets on December 31, 2020. The revolving credit facility also includes a cross-default provision, which triggers an event of default under the credit facility in the event of an uncured payment default relating to any indebtedness of us or any of our subsidiaries in a principal amount of $\n75.0\nmillion or more.\nOur indentures generally do not contain any financial maintenance covenants. However, our indentures are generally subject to cross-default provisions ranging from uncured payment defaults of $\n5\nmillion to $\n50\nmillion, and limitations on the incurrence of liens on our assets, generally exempting liens on utility assets, purchase money security interests, preexisting security interests and an additional subset of assets capped at\n10\n% of our consolidated net tangible assets.\n16.\nShort-Term Borrowings\nWe generate short-term borrowings from our revolving credit facility, commercial paper program, and accounts receivable transfer programs. Each of these borrowing sources is described further below.\nRevolving Credit Facility.\nWe maintain a revolving credit facility to fund ongoing working capital requirements, including the provision of liquidity support for our commercial paper program, provide for issuance of letters of credit and also for general corporate purposes. Our revolving credit facility has a program limit of $\n1.85\nbillion and is comprised of a syndicate of banks led by Barclays. On February 18, 2022, we extended the termination date of our revolving credit facility to February 18, 2027. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under this facility.\nCommercial Paper Program.\nOur commercial paper program has a program limit of up to $\n1.5\nbillion with a dealer group comprised of Barclays, Citigroup, Credit Suisse and Wells Fargo. We had $\n560.0\nmillion and $\n503.0\nmillion of commercial paper outstanding with weighted-average interest rates of\n0.24\n% and\n0.27\n% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAccounts Receivable Transfer Programs.\nColumbia of Ohio, NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania each maintain a receivables agreement whereby they transfer their customer accounts receivables to third party financial institutions through wholly-owned and consolidated special purpose entities. The three agreements expire between May 2022 and October 2022 and may be further extended if mutually agreed to by the parties thereto.\nAll receivables transferred to third parties are valued at face value, which approximates fair value due to their short-term nature. The amount of the undivided percentage ownership interest in the accounts receivables transferred is determined in part by required loss reserves under the agreements.\nTransfers of accounts receivable are accounted for as secured borrowings resulting in the recognition of short-term borrowings on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  As of December 31, 2021, the maximum amount of debt that could be recognized related to our accounts receivable programs is $\n270.0\nmillion.\n108\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nWe had\nno\nshort-term borrowings related to the securitization transactions as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nzero\nand $\n353.2\nmillion, respectively, were recorded as cash flows used for financing activities related to the change in short-term borrowings due to securitization transactions. For the accounts receivable transfer programs, we pay used facility fees for amounts borrowed, unused commitment fees for amounts not borrowed, and upfront renewal fees. Fees associated with the securitization transactions were $\n1.4\nmillion, $\n2.6\nmillion, and $\n2.6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Columbia of Ohio, NIPSCO and Columbia of Pennsylvania remain responsible for collecting on the receivables securitized, and the receivables cannot be transferred to another party.\nItems listed above are presented net in the Statements of Consolidated Cash Flows as their maturities are less than 90 days.\n17.\nLeases\nLease Descriptions.\nWe are the lessee for substantially all of our leasing activity, which includes operating and finance leases for corporate and field offices, railcars, fleet vehicles and certain IT assets. Our corporate and field office leases have remaining lease terms between\n1\nand\n22\nyears with options to renew the leases for up to\n25\nyears. We lease railcars to transport coal to and from our electric generation facilities in Indiana. Our railcars are specifically identified in the lease agreement, which have a remaining lease term of\n1\nyear with options to renew for\n1\nyear. Our fleet vehicles include trucks, trailers and equipment that have been customized specifically for use in the utility industry. We lease fleet vehicles on\n1\nyear terms, after which we have the option to extend on a month-to-month basis or terminate with written notice. ROU assets and liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets do not include obligations for possible fleet vehicle lease renewals beyond the initial lease term. While we have the ability to renew these leases beyond the initial term, we are not reasonably certain to do so. We lease the majority of our IT assets under\n4\nyear lease terms. Ownership of leased IT assets is transferred to us at the end of the lease term.\nWe have not provided material residual value guarantees for our leases, nor do our leases contain material restrictions or covenants. Lease contracts containing renewal and termination options are mostly exercisable at our sole discretion. Certain of our real estate and railcar leases include renewal periods in the measurement of the lease obligation if we have deemed the renewals reasonably certain to be exercised.\nWith respect to service contracts involving the use of assets, if we have the right to direct the use of the asset and obtain substantially all economic benefits from the use of an asset, we account for the service contract as a lease. Unless specifically provided to us by the lessor, we utilize NiSource's collateralized incremental borrowing rate commensurate to the lease term as the discount rate for all of our leases. ASC 842 permits a lessee, by class of underlying asset, not to separate nonlease components from lease components. Our policy is to apply this expedient for our leases of fleet vehicles, IT assets and railcars when calculating their respective lease liabilities.\nLease costs for the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 are presented in the table below. These costs include both amounts recognized in expense and amounts capitalized as part of the cost of another asset.\nIncome statement presentation for these costs (when ultimately recognized on the income statement) is also included:\n109\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nRisk Management Assets and Liabilities.\nRisk management assets and liabilities include interest rate swaps, exchange-traded NYMEX futures and NYMEX options and non-exchange-based forward purchase contracts.\nLevel 1-\nWhen utilized, exchange-traded derivative contracts are based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and are classified within Level 1. These financial assets and liabilities are secured with cash on deposit with the exchange; therefore, nonperformance risk has not been incorporated into these valuations. These financial assets and liabilities are deemed to be cleared and settled daily by NYMEX as the related cash collateral is posted with the exchange. As a result of this exchange rule, NYMEX derivatives are considered to have no fair value at the balance sheet date for financial reporting purposes, and are presented in Level 1 net of posted cash; however, the derivatives remain outstanding and are subject to future commodity price fluctuations until they are settled in accordance with their contractual terms.\nLevel 2-\nCertain non-exchange-traded derivatives are valued using broker or over-the-counter, on-line exchanges. In such cases, these non-exchange-traded derivatives are classified within Level 2. Non-exchange-based derivative instruments include swaps, forwards, and options. In certain instances, these instruments may utilize models to measure fair value. We use a similar model to value similar instruments. Valuation models utilize various inputs that include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, other observable inputs for the asset or liability and market-corroborated inputs, (i.e., inputs derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means). Where observable inputs are available for substantially the full term of the asset or liability, the instrument is categorized within Level 2.\nLevel 3-\nCertain derivatives trade in less active markets with a lower availability of pricing information and models may be utilized in the valuation. When such inputs have a significant impact on the measurement of fair value, the instrument is categorized within Level 3.\nCredit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of derivative instruments that are not exchange-traded. Credit exposures are adjusted to reflect collateral agreements that reduce exposures. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were\nno\nmaterial transfers between fair value hierarchies. Additionally, there were no changes in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of our financial instruments.\nCredit risk is considered in the fair value calculation of each of our forward-starting interest rate swaps, as described in Note 10, \"Risk Management Activities.\" As they are based on observable data and valuations of similar instruments, the hedges are categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. There was no exchange of premium at the initial date of the swaps, and we can settle the contracts at any time.\nNIPSCO has entered into long-term forward natural gas purchase instruments to lock in a fixed price for its natural gas customers. We value these contracts using a pricing model that incorporates market-based information when available, as these instruments trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.  For additional information see Note 10, “Risk Management Activities.”\n112\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nAvailable-for-Sale Debt Securities.\nAvailable-for-sale debt securities are investments pledged as collateral for trust accounts related to our wholly-owned insurance company. We value U.S. Treasury, corporate debt and mortgage-backed securities using a matrix pricing model that incorporates market-based information. These securities trade less frequently and are classified within Level 2.\nOur available-for-sale debt securities impairments are recognized periodically using an allowance approach. At each reporting date, we utilize a quantitative and qualitative review process to assess the impairment of available-for-sale debt securities at the individual security level. For securities in a loss position, we evaluate our intent to sell or whether it is more-likely-than-not that we will be required to sell the security prior to the recovery of its amortized cost. If either criteria is met, the loss is recognized in earnings immediately, with the offsetting entry to the carrying value of the security. If both criteria are not met, we perform an analysis to determine whether the unrealized loss is related to credit factors. The analysis focuses on a variety of factors that include, but are not limited to, downgrade on ratings of the security, defaults in the current reporting period or projected defaults in the future, the security's yield spread over treasuries, and other relevant market data. If the unrealized loss is not related to credit factors, it is included in other comprehensive income. If the unrealized loss is related to credit factors, the loss is recognized as credit loss expense in earnings during the period, with an offsetting entry to the allowance for credit losses. The amount of the credit loss recorded to the allowance account is limited by the amount at which the security's fair value is less than its amortized cost basis. If certain amounts recorded in the allowance for credit losses are deemed uncollectible, the allowance on the uncollectible portion will be charged off, with an offsetting entry to the carrying value of the security. Subsequent improvements to the estimated credit losses of available-for-sale debt securities will be recognized immediately in earnings. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we recorded $\n0.2\nmillion and $\n0.5\nmillion, respectively, as an allowance for credit losses on available-for-sale debt securities as a result of the analysis described above. Continuous credit monitoring and portfolio credit balancing mitigates our risk of credit losses on our available-for-sale debt securities.\nThe amortized cost, gross unrealized gains and losses, allowance for credit losses, and fair value of available-for-sale securities  at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were:\n(1)\nFair value of U.S. Treasury debt securities and Corporate/Other debt securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses is $\n36.2\nand $\n35.4\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2021.\n(2)\nFair value of U.S. Treasury debt securities and Corporate/Other debt securities in an unrealized loss position without an allowance for credit losses is\nzero\nand $\n13.2\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2020.\nRealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities were immaterial for the year-ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe cost of maturities sold is based upon specific identification. At December 31, 2021, approximately $\n8.2\nmillion of U.S. Treasury debt securities and approximately $\n3.8\nmillion of Corporate/Other debt securities have maturities of less than a year.\nThere are\nno\nmaterial items in the fair value reconciliation of Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n113\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nNon-recurring Fair Value Measurements\nWe measure the fair value of certain assets, including goodwill, on a non-recurring basis, typically when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable.\nThe sale of the Massachusetts Business occurred on October 9, 2020, and the assets and liabilities of the Massachusetts Business were measured at fair value, less costs to sell.\nIn March 2021, we reached an agreement with Eversource regarding the final purchase price, including net working capital adjustments to the October 9, 2020 purchase price of our Massachusetts Business. The working capital amounts were measured at fair value, less costs to sell.\nPurchase Contract Liability.\nAt April 19, 2021, we recorded the purchase contract liability at fair value using a discounted cash flow method and observable, market-corroborated inputs. This estimate was made at April 19, 2021, and will not be remeasured at each subsequent balance sheet date. It has been categorized within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. Refer to Note 13, ''Equity'' for additional information.\nB.         Other Fair Value Disclosures for Financial Instruments\n. The carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash, notes receivable, customer deposits and short-term borrowings is a reasonable estimate of fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Our long-term borrowings are recorded at historical amounts.\nThe following method and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments.\nLong-term debt\n. The fair value of outstanding long-term debt is estimated based on the quoted market prices for the same or similar securities. Certain premium costs associated with the early settlement of long-term debt are not taken into consideration in determining fair value. These fair value measurements are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no change in the method or significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of long-term debt.\nThe carrying amount and estimated fair values of these financial instruments were as follows:\n114\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\n19.\nOther Commitments and Contingencies\nA.\nContractual Obligations\n. We have certain contractual obligations requiring payments at specified periods. The obligations include long-term debt, lease obligations, energy commodity contracts and obligations for various services including pipeline capacity and outsourcing of IT services. The total contractual obligations in existence at December 31, 2021 and their maturities were:\n(1)\nLong-term debt balance excludes unamortized issuance costs and discounts of $\n79.1\nmillion.\n(2)\nFinance lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $\n58.7\nmillion.\n(3)\nOperating lease payments shown above are inclusive of interest totaling $\n6.8\nmillion. Operating lease balances do not include obligations for possible fleet vehicle lease renewals beyond the initial lease term. While we have the ability to renew these leases beyond the initial term, we are not reasonably certain to do so as they are renewed month-to-month after the first year. If we were to continue the fleet vehicle leases outstanding at December 31, 2021, payments would be $\n33.3\nmillion in 2022, $\n30.2\nmillion in 2023, $\n27.2\nmillion in 2024, $\n24.0\nmillion in 2025, $\n17.0\nmillion in 2026 and $\n16.1\nmillion thereafter.\n(4)\nOther liabilities shown above are inclusive of the Rosewater and Indiana Crossroads Developer payments due in 2023 and Equity Unit purchase contract liability payments to be made in 2022 and 2023.\nPurchase and Service Obligations.\nWe have entered into various purchase and service agreements whereby we are contractually obligated to make certain minimum payments in future periods. Our purchase obligations are for the purchase of physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. Our service agreements encompass a broad range of business support and maintenance functions which are generally described below.\nOur subsidiaries have entered into various energy commodity contracts to purchase physical quantities of natural gas, electricity and coal. These amounts represent the minimum quantity of these commodities we are obligated to purchase at both fixed and variable prices. To the extent contractual purchase prices are variable, obligations disclosed in the table above are valued at market prices as of December 31, 2021.\nNIPSCO has power purchase arrangements representing a total of\n500\nMW of wind power, with contracts expiring between 2024 and 2040. No minimum quantities are specified within these agreements due to the variability of electricity generation from wind, so no amounts related to these contracts are included in the table above. Upon early termination of one of these agreements by NIPSCO for any reason (other than material breach by the counterparties), NIPSCO may be required to pay a termination charge that could be material depending on the events giving rise to termination and the timing of the termination.\nWe have pipeline service agreements that provide for pipeline capacity, transportation and storage services. These agreements, which have expiration dates ranging from\n2022\nto\n2038\n, require us to pay fixed monthly charges.\nNIPSCO has contracts with\nthree\nmajor rail operators providing for coal transportation services for which there are certain minimum payments. These service contracts extend for various periods through\n2028\n.\nWe have executed agreements with multiple IT service providers. The agreements extend for various periods through\n2027\n.\n115\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nB.        Guarantees and Indemnities\n. We and certain of our subsidiaries enter into various agreements providing financial or performance assurance to third parties on behalf of certain subsidiaries as part of normal business. Such agreements include guarantees and stand-by letters of credit. These agreements are entered into primarily to support or enhance the creditworthiness otherwise attributed to a subsidiary on a stand-alone basis, thereby facilitating the extension of sufficient credit to accomplish the subsidiaries’ intended commercial purposes.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had issued stand-by letters of credit of $\n18.9\nmillion and $\n15.2\nmillion, respectively, for the benefit of third parties.\nWe provide guarantees related to our future performance under BTAs for our renewable generation projects. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, our guarantees for multiple BTAs totaled $\n288.9\nmillion and $\n40.7\nmillion, respectively. In February 2022, the amount of the guarantees increased to $\n485.2\nmillion in accordance with the Fairbanks and Cavalry BTAs. The amount of each guaranty will decrease upon the substantial completion of the construction of the facilities. See “- F. Other Matters - Generation Transition,” below for more information.\nC.        Legal Proceedings\n. On September 13, 2018, a series of fires and explosions occurred in Lawrence, Andover and North Andover, Massachusetts related to the delivery of natural gas by Columbia of Massachusetts (the \"Greater Lawrence Incident\").\nWe have been subject to inquiries and investigations by government authorities and regulatory agencies regarding the Greater Lawrence Incident. On February 26, 2020, the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Massachusetts to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident, as described below.\nThe Company and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into an agreement with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office (among other parties) to resolve the Massachusetts DPU and the Massachusetts Attorney General’s Office investigations, that was approved by the Massachusetts DPU on October 7, 2020 as part of the sale of the Massachusetts Business to Eversource.\nU.S. Department of Justice Investigation.\nOn February 26, 2020, the Company and Columbia of Massachusetts entered into agreements with the U.S. Attorney’s Office to resolve the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s investigation relating to the Greater Lawrence Incident. Columbia of Massachusetts agreed to plead guilty in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (the “Court”) to violating the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act (the “Plea Agreement”), and the Company entered into a Deferred Prosecution Agreement (the “DPA”).\nOn March 9, 2020, Columbia of Massachusetts entered its guilty plea pursuant to the Plea Agreement. The Court sentenced Columbia of Massachusetts on June 23, 2020, in accordance with the terms of the Plea Agreement (as modified).\nOn June 23, 2021, the Court terminated Columbia of Massachusetts' period of probation under the Plea Agreement, which marked the completion of all terms of the Plea Agreement.\nUnder the DPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office agreed to defer prosecution of the Company in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident for a three-year period (which three-year period may be extended for twelve (12) months upon the U.S. Attorney’s Office’s determination of a breach of the DPA) subject to certain obligations of the Company, including, but not limited to, the Company's agreement, as to each of the Company’s subsidiaries involved in the distribution of gas through pipeline facilities in Massachusetts, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Kentucky and Virginia to implement and adhere to each of the recommendations from the NTSB stemming from the Greater Lawrence Incident. Pursuant to the DPA, if the Company complies with all of its obligations under the DPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office will not file any criminal charges against the Company related to the Greater Lawrence Incident.\nPrivate Actions.\nVarious lawsuits, including several purported class action lawsuits, were filed by various affected residents or businesses in Massachusetts state courts against the Company and/or Columbia of Massachusetts in connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident.\nOn March 12, 2020, the Court granted final approval of the settlement of the consolidated class action. With respect to claims not included in the consolidated class action, many of the asserted wrongful death and bodily injury claims have settled, and we continue to discuss potential settlements with remaining claimants. The outcomes and impacts of such private actions are uncertain at this time.\nShareholder Derivative Lawsuit.\nOn April 28, 2020, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed by the City of Detroit Police and Fire Retirement System in the United States District Court for the District of Delaware against certain of the Company's current and former directors, alleging state-law claims for breaches of fiduciary duty with respect to the pipeline safety\n116\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nmanagement systems relating to the distribution of natural gas prior to the Greater Lawrence Incident and also including federal-law claims related to our proxy statement disclosures regarding our safety systems. The remedies sought included damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate governance reforms, and restitution of any unjust enrichment. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit and oral argument was held on March 2, 2021. On March 9, 2021, the district court granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss. It dismissed the federal-law claims with prejudice for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted and declined to exercise jurisdiction over the state-law claims, which were dismissed without prejudice.\nFollowing the dismissal of the federal court action, on April 29, 2021, the same plaintiff filed a shareholder derivative lawsuit in the Delaware Court of Chancery against certain of our current and former directors.  The new complaint alleged a single count for breach of fiduciary duty, and no longer alleged disclosure violations or breaches of federal securities laws.  The complaint related to substantially the same matters as those alleged in the dismissed federal derivative complaint.  The remedies sought included damages for the alleged breaches of fiduciary duty, corporate governance reforms, and restitution of compensation by the individual defendants. On May 19, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and on July 2, 2021, they filed their opening brief in support of the motion. On August 26, 2021, rather than respond to the defendants’ motion to dismiss and opening brief, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint. Like the original complaint in the Delaware Court of Chancery, the amended complaint alleges a single count for breach of fiduciary duty, based on substantially similar allegations, and seeks substantially similar remedies. On September 10, 2021, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. Briefing on the defendants' motion to dismiss was completed on January 10, 2022, and oral argument on the defendants' motion to dismiss took place on February 3, 2022. Because of the preliminary nature of this lawsuit, we are not able to estimate a loss or range of loss, if any, that may be incurred in connection with this matter at this time.\nOther Claims and Proceedings.\nWe are also party to certain other claims, regulatory and legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business in each state in which we have operations, none of which we believe to be individually material at this time.\nDue to the inherent uncertainty of litigation, there can be no assurance that the resolution of any particular claim, proceeding or investigation would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position or liquidity. If one or more other matters were decided against us, the effects could be material to our results of operations in the period in which we would be required to record or adjust the related liability and could also be material to our cash flows in the periods that we would be required to pay such liability.\nD.        Other Greater Lawrence Incident Matters\n. In connection with the Greater Lawrence Incident, Columbia of Massachusetts, in cooperation with the Massachusetts Governor’s office, replaced the entire affected pipeline system. We invested approximately $\n258\nmillion of capital spend for the pipeline replacement; this work was completed in 2019. We maintain property insurance for gas pipelines and other applicable property. Columbia of Massachusetts has filed a proof of loss with its property insurer for the pipeline replacement. In January 2020, we filed a lawsuit against the property insurer, seeking payment of our property claim. On October 27, 2021, NiSource and the property insurer filed cross motions for summary judgment, each asking the court to determine whether there was coverage under the policy. After the cross motions for summary judgment were fully briefed, we reached an agreement in principle to settle the coverage dispute for a portion of the above invested amount. We expect that the agreement will be finalized, a settlement payment by the insurer to NiSource will be made, and the case will be dismissed by the end of the first quarter of 2022.\nE.        Environmental Matters\n.\nOur operations are subject to environmental statutes and regulations related to air quality, water quality, hazardous waste and solid waste. We believe that we are in substantial compliance with the environmental regulations currently applicable to our operations.\nIt is management's continued intent to address environmental issues in cooperation with regulatory authorities in such a manner as to achieve mutually acceptable compliance plans. However, there can be no assurance that fines and penalties will not be incurred. Management expects a majority of environmental assessment and remediation costs and asset retirement costs, further described below, to be recoverable through rates. See Note 9, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for additional detail.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had recorded a liability of $\n91.1\nmillion and $\n92.6\nmillion, respectively, to cover environmental remediation at various sites. This liability is included in \"Other accruals\" and \"Other noncurrent liabilities\" in the  Consolidated Balance Sheets. We recognize costs associated with environmental remediation obligations when the incurrence of such costs is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated. The original estimates for remediation activities may differ materially from the amount ultimately expended. The actual future expenditures depend on many factors, including laws\n117\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA (continued)\nand regulations, the nature and extent of impact and the method of remediation. These expenditures are not currently estimable at some sites. We periodically adjust our liability as information is collected and estimates become more refined. See Note 8, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" for a discussion of all obligations, including those discussed below.\nCERCLA.\nOur subsidiaries are potentially responsible parties at waste disposal sites under the CERCLA and similar state laws. Under CERCLA, each potentially responsible party can be held jointly, severally and strictly liable for the remediation costs as the EPA, or state, can allow the parties to pay for remedial action or perform remedial action themselves and request reimbursement from the potentially responsible parties. Our affiliates have retained CERCLA environmental liabilities, including remediation liabilities, associated with certain current and former operations. At this time, NIPSCO cannot estimate the full cost of remediating properties that have not yet been investigated, but it is possible that the future costs could be material to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMGP.\nWe maintain a program to identify and investigate former MGP sites where Gas Distribution Operations subsidiaries or predecessors may have liability. The program has identified\n54\nsuch sites where liability is probable. Remedial actions at many of these sites are being overseen by state or federal environmental agencies through consent agreements or voluntary remediation agreements.\nWe utilize a probabilistic model to estimate our future remediation costs related to MGP sites. The model was prepared with the assistance of a third party and incorporates our experience and general industry experience with remediating MGP sites. We complete an annual refresh of the model in the second quarter of each fiscal year. No material changes to the estimated future remediation costs were noted as a result of the refresh completed as of June 30, 2021. Our total estimated liability related to the facilities subject to remediation was $\n85.1\nmillion and $\n85.0\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The liability represents our best estimate of the probable cost to remediate the MGP sites. We believe that it is reasonably possible that remediation costs could vary by as much as $\n17\nmillion in addition to the costs noted above. Remediation costs are estimated based on the best available information, applicable remediation standards at the balance sheet date, and experience with similar facilities.\nCCRs.\nWe are in compliance with the EPA's final rule for the regulation of CCRs. The CCR rule also resulted in revisions to previously recorded legal obligations associated with the retirement of certain NIPSCO facilities. The actual asset retirement costs related to the CCR rule may vary substantially from the estimates used to record the increased asset retirement obligation due to the uncertainty about the requirements that will be established by environmental authorities, compliance strategies that will be used and the preliminary nature of available data used to estimate costs. As allowed by the rule, NIPSCO will continue to collect data over time to determine the specific compliance solutions and associated costs and, as a result, the actual costs may vary. NIPSCO will also continue to work with the EPA and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management to obtain administrative approvals associated with the CCR rule. In the event that the approvals are not obtained, future operations could be impacted. We cannot estimate the likelihood that the agencies will deny approvals or the financial impact on us if these approvals are not obtained.\nF.         Other Matters.\nGeneration Transition.\nNIPSCO has executed several PPAs to purchase\n100\n% of the output from renewable generation facilities at a fixed price per MWh. Each facility supplying the energy will have an associated nameplate capacity, and payments under the PPAs will not begin until the associated generation facility is constructed by the owner/seller. NIPSCO has also executed several BTAs with developers to construct renewable generation facilities. NIPSCO's purchase obligation under each respective BTAs is dependent on satisfactory approval of the BTA by the IURC, successful execution by NIPSCO of an agreement with a tax equity partner and timely completion of construction. NIPSCO has received IURC approval for all of its BTAs and PPAs. NIPSCO and the tax equity partner are obligated to make cash contributions to the joint venture that acquires the project at the date construction is substantially complete. Once the tax equity partner has earned its negotiated rate of return and we have reached the agreed upon contractual date, NIPSCO has the option to purchase at fair market value from the tax equity partner the remaining interest in the joint venture.\nEmployee Separation Benefits.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, we launched a program to evaluate our organizational structure under the auspices of NiSource Next, which has continued into 2021. We recognized the majority of the related severance expense in 2020 when the employees accepted severance offers, absent a retention period. For employees that have a retention period, expense will be recognized over the remaining service period. The total severance expense for employees is approximately $\n42\nmillion, with substantially all of it incurred and paid to date.\n118\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nITEM 8.

Based upon that evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that financial information was processed, recorded and reported accurately.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management, including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, are responsible for establishing and maintaining internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined under Rule 13a-15(f) or Rule 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act. However, management would note that a control system can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the objectives of the control system are met. Our management has adopted the 2013 framework set forth in the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission report, Internal Control - Integrated Framework, the most commonly used and understood framework for evaluating internal control over financial reporting, as its framework for evaluating the reliability and effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. During 2021, we conducted an evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of the end of the period covered by this annual report.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, issued an attestation report on our internal controls over financial reporting which is included herein.\nChanges in Internal Controls\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recently completed quarter covered by this report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n124\nITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nN\nI\nS\nOURCE\nI\nNC\n.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of NiSource Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of NiSource Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 23, 2022\n125"
