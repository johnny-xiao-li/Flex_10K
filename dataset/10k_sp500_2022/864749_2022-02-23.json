This strategy contains two elements.  The first element, Connect, aims to connect more customer workflows, industry life cycles, and solution offerings, so that we can continue to transform the way our customers work.  This includes integrating more of our customers’ data through cloud offerings and making more of our solutions available over time on a subscription basis.  Cloud enablement raises the bar with shared, on-demand services that empower network participants to proactively contribute to organic value creation and delivery directly and with fewer intermediaries.  When end users interact on a shared, online platform, the overall value that is created increases as the number of end-user participants increases.  This network effect means that the willingness of developers, partners, or end users to engage increases as the number of network participants grows, which further enhances the platform experience and end-user value.  The second element, Scale, aims to invest in the people, processes, and technologies that are necessary to streamline and standardize our internal processes, provide a seamless experience for our customers as they engage with our connected solutions, and enable us to continue to grow our business efficiently and effectively for many years into the future.\n•\nIncreasing focus on software and services.\nSoftware and services targeted for the needs of vertical end markets are increasingly important elements of our solutions and are core to our growth strategy.  We generally have an open application programming interface philosophy and open vendor environment, which leads to increased adoption of our software and analytics offerings.  These software and services solutions integrate and optimize additional workflows for our customers, thereby improving their work productivity, and in the case of subscription, maintenance, and support services, also provide us with enhanced business visibility over time.  Professional services constitute an additional customer offering that helps our customers integrate and optimize the use of our offerings in their environment.\n•\nFocus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential.\nWe focus on large markets historically underserved by technology that offer significant potential for long-term revenue growth, profitability, and market leadership.  Our core industries, such as construction, agriculture, and transportation, are each multi-trillion dollar global industries that operate in demanding environments with technology adoption in the early phases relative to other industries.  With the emergence of mobile and cloud computing capabilities, the increasing technological know-how of end users, and compelling return on investment, we believe many of our markets are attractive for substituting Trimble’s technology and solutions in place of traditional operating methods\n.\n•\nDomain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base.\nWe have over time redefined our technological focus from hardware-driven point solutions to integrated work process solutions by developing domain expertise and heavily reinvesting in research and development (“R&D”) and acquisitions.  We currently have over 1,000 unique patents reflective of our technology portfolio and deep domain knowledge to deliver specific, targeted solutions quickly and cost-effectively to each of the vertical markets we serve.  We look for opportunities where the opportunity for technological change is high and that have a requirement for the integration of multiple technologies into complete vertical solutions.\n•\nGeographic expansion with localization strategy.\nWe view international expansion as an important element of our strategy, and we continue to position ourselves in geographic markets that will serve as important sources of future growth.  We currently have distribution channels in over 85 countries, and sales are supported by our own offices located in over 40 countries around the world.\n•\nOptimized go-to-market strategies to best access our markets.\nWe utilize vertically focused go-to-market strategies that leverage domain expertise to best serve the needs of individual markets both domestically and abroad.  These go-to-market capabilities include independent dealers, joint ventures, original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), and distribution alliances with key partners, such as CNH Industrial, Caterpillar, and Nikon, as well as direct sales to end users, which provide us with broad market reach and localization capabilities to effectively serve our markets.\n6\n•\nStrategic acquisitions.\nOrganic growth continues to be our primary focus, while acquisitions serve to enhance our market position.  We acquire businesses that bring domain expertise, geographic presence, technology, products, and distribution capabilities that augment our portfolio and allow us to penetrate existing markets more effectively, or to establish a market beachhead.  Our success in targeting and effectively integrating acquisitions is an important aspect of our\ngrowth strategy.\n•\nVenture fund investments.\nIn 2021, we announced a newly formed strategic venture fund.  With this fund, we expect to invest up to $200 million in early- to growth-stage companies that can accelerate innovation and effectively bring new solutions to our customers and the industries that we serve and would give us an early, inside look and stake in emerging business and technology solutions.\n•\nSustainability.\nThe global economy is experiencing a fundamental shift toward sustainability driven through broad stakeholder engagement, with a focus on decarbonization.  Historically, through delivering productivity and efficiency gains, Trimble products have delivered sustainability for our customers, and we envision more opportunities to deliver expanded carbon reductions and other sustainability benefits, such as water management in agriculture and utilities, for our customers through our Connect and Scale and the other strategies we have described.\nOur focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model.

Our focus on diversity starts at the top.  Four out of our eleven board members are female or ethnically diverse, placing us in a select group of companies.  In 2021, we activated many new initiatives focused on infusing diversity, equity, and inclusion in the fabric of our connected culture.  Our Vice President of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion and a DEI core team cascade objectives that are aligned\nwith our Trimble values, while also encouraging local teams to focus on aspects of diversity that foster meaningful inclusion and belonging.  In quarterly business reviews, we review gender and U.S. ethnicity demographics and trends for every business within Trimble, as well as region and business-led initiatives that will lead toward future progress.\n12\nWe have a number of employee resource networks that enhance our inclusive and diverse culture, including networks that support women, caregivers, Black, Hispanic/Latinx and Indian professionals, veterans, employees with disabilities, and our LGBTQ+ community.  We are focused on measuring and increasing gender representation, as well as race and ethnic diversity in high-impact roles such as front-line management, engineering, product management, and sales.  We have provided increased access to diversity and inclusion educational resources, training, assessments, articles, and other employee forums to help us work together and more effectively across a variety of cultures globally.\nWe are committed to inspiring and attracting extraordinary and diverse talent.  The hiring and retention of top talent is always a strategic priority, and increasingly, a challenging one.  In addition, our increasing focus on technologies, such as cloud and autonomy, requires us to compete against leading companies in the technology sector.  Colleges and universities remain an important source of talented recruits.  We aim to transform and re-invent the way Trimble attracts and hires employees to increase diversity.  Initiative\ns include modifications to our recruiting process to ensure the inclusion of diverse, underrepresented candidates, developing relationships with universities with higher underrepresentation, creating diverse talent pools, and increasing networking and referrals with diverse professional organizations.\nIn 2021, we created our Renew Returnship program that provides employment opportunities for those who have taken a break in their careers to look after their families.  We engaged in new relationships with the National Society of Black Engineers, participated in national and local diversity career fairs, and sponsored new engagements focused on increasing gender and race/ethnic diversity in the industries we serve through groups like Construction and Transportation Girl.  We announced the Dr. Gladys West Scholarship Program through the Trimble Foundation to honor a GPS technology pioneer and woman of color by awarding scholars at three universities serving underrepresented students, and we also added new Trimble technology labs at Minority Serving Institutions.\nCompensation and Benefits\nWe believe people should be paid for the role they perform and their skills and experience, regardless of their gender, race, age, or other personal characteristics.  To deliver on that commitment, we benchmark and set pay ranges based on market data and consider factors such as an employee’s role, their experience, their performance, and the region in which they live.  We also regularly review our compensation practices to ensure our pay is fair and equitable.  In addition to base salaries,\ncertain roles are eligible to participate in short-term and long-term incentive plans\n.\nWe offer market competitive benefit programs (which vary by country/region), which include health and wellness benefits, life insurance and disability benefits, flexible savings accounts, paid time off, parental and family leave, employee support programs, retirement plans, and an employee stock purchase plan.  Other benefits include fertility, adoption, and surrogacy education assistance; gender dysphoria, family and caregiver support; flexible work schedules; education assistance; and on-site services such as health centers and fitness centers at some sites.\nTalent Development\nWe are committed to providing every employee with the opportunity to learn, grow, and excel in a respectful and collaborative workplace.  Part of our people development mission is to create a culture of continuous learning and curiosity.  We believe that skills and abilities can be developed through training, relationships, and experiential learning.  We are launching new career growth and development initiatives to empower employees to identify skill development resources, and provide projects and job opportunities to achieve their personal goals and full potential.  We encourage employees to nurture a love of continuous learning and a resilience that is essential for accomplishment.\nWe have a framework for people development that is employee-centric and evidence-based.  Employees and managers have frequent, casual conversations based upon employee survey data that drive engagement, career growth, and retention.  These surveys also include questions oriented around the Company’s mission, vision, values, and purpose, work environment, diversity and inclusion, career development, and employee-manager relations.  Our internal worldwide training portal, Learn.Trimble.com, provides a set of resources that is easy to access anytime and anywhere, with a range of focus areas from new employees to existing employee development to manager development.\nBuilding Connections\nWe believe that building connections between our employees, their families, and our communities creates a more meaningful, fulfilling, and enjoyable workplace.  Since our employees are passionate about a variety of causes, our company giving and volunteering programs support and encourage employees by engaging with those causes.  In our offices around the world, our employee-led committees select local organizations to support, often in the form of grants and employee fundraising.  We also frequently collaborate with these organizations on volunteer activities for our employees.\nLastly, we encourage and provide our employees with a day of service as a benefit to help our communities.\n13\nOur Trimble Foundation aligns international philanthropic efforts by giving back to the communities where Trimble does business and helping those in need.  We do this by supporting three focus areas, disaster and climate resilience; female education and empowerment; and diversity, equity, and inclusion, as well as by supporting the philanthropic efforts of our local offices.\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nThe success of our business is fundamentally connected to the well-being of our people.  Accordingly, we are committed to the health, safety, and wellness of our employees.  We provide our employees and their families with access to a variety of innovative, flexible, and convenient health and wellness programs, including benefits that provide protection and security so they can have peace of mind concerning events that may require time away from work or that impact their financial well-being; that support their physical and mental health by providing tools and resources to help them improve or maintain their health status and encourage engagement in healthy behaviors; and that offer choice where possible so they can customize their benefits to meet their needs and the needs of their families.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented changes that we determined were in the best interest of our employees, as well as the communities in which we operate, and which comply with government regulations.  This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures for employees continuing critical on-site work.\nAvailable Information\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports are available free of charge on our website through\ninvestor.trimble.com\n, as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

    "text": "RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES\nYou should carefully consider the following risk factors, in addition to the other information contained in this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K and in any other documents to which we refer you in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, before purchasing our securities.  The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face.\nRisks related to our business\nOur financial condition and results of operations have been and may continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic\nOur overall performance depends upon domestic and worldwide economic and political conditions.  The global spread of COVID-19 continues to create volatility, uncertainty, and economic disruption.  The pandemic caused a slowdown in worldwide economic activity and is currently causing disruptions to global supply chains.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to have widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts on global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices.  Despite the efforts to contain the pandemic, new variants of the virus are causing additional outbreaks.  The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted and may continue to impact our business operations, including our employees, customers, partners, and communities, and there is substantial uncertainty in the nature and degree of its continued effects over time.\nThe extent to which COVID-19 impacts our business, operations, and financial results will depend on numerous evolving factors that we are not able to accurately predict, including:\n•\nthe continuing economic impacts of the pandemic;\n•\ngovernmental, business, and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic;\n•\nthe effect on our customers and customer demand for and ability to pay for our products and services;\n•\nrestrictions or disruptions to transportation, including reduced availability of ground or air transport;\n•\ncontinued disruption of the supply chain for our products;\n•\nour ability to comply with financial covenants, including maintaining required leverage ratios, which could result in debt becoming due and payable prior to its stated maturity; and\n•\nchanges in our effective tax rate due to effects of COVID-19 on our geographic mix of earnings.\nWe have experienced disruption in our supply chain as a result of the effects of COVID-19 and related events, and are subject to ongoing supply chain risks, which adversely affect our revenue and results of operations\nWe are dependent upon a limited number of contract manufacturers for the manufacture, testing, and assembly of certain products and specific suppliers for a number of our critical components.  Our current reliance on a limited group of contract manufacturers and suppliers involves risks, including the potential inability to obtain products or components to meet customers’ delivery requirements, reduced control over pricing and delivery schedules and discontinuation of or increased prices for certain components.  We have experienced disruption in our supply chain as a result of the effects of COVID-19 related events and their impact on our suppliers and on international trade in general, leading to shortfalls in available components we need to make products as well as increased costs to obtain components, to make products, and to transport components and products.  Some suppliers have prioritized the orders of larger customers and are focusing their investments in additional capacity on higher volume components.\nWe are experiencing extended delivery times for certain components of our hardware products and increased freight costs.  As a result, we are making binding commitments with longer lead times and procuring components at higher prices, which may impact our flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and product demand.  These disruptions have had an adverse effect on our ability to meet customer demand and have resulted in delays in shipping products to customers and dealers.  T\nhe severity of the disruptions is continuously changing so that the impact on our ability to meet demand for particular products varies over time, which creates substantial uncertainties in forecasting our financial results.  We expect these disruptions to impact our financial results.\nFuture disruptions could occur as a result of any number of events, including, but not limited to, the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, increases in wages that drive up prices or labor, the imposition of new regulations, quotas or embargoes on components, a scarcity of, or significant increase in the price of, required components for our products, trade restrictions, tariffs or duties, fluctuations in currency exchange rates, transportation failures affecting the supply chain and shipment of materials and finished goods, third party interference in the integrity of the products sourced through the supply chain, the unavailability of raw materials, severe weather conditions, natural disasters, civil unrest, military conflicts, geopolitical developments, war or terrorism, and disruptions in utility and other services.  Any other circumstance that would require us to seek alternative sources of supply or to manufacture, assemble, and test such components internally could significantly delay our ability to ship our products, which could damage relationships with current and prospective customers and could harm our reputation and brand as well as our results of operations.\nLastly, due to supply chain issues, we may accumulate excess inventories if we inaccurately forecast demand for our products.\n17\nWe operate globally and are subject to significant risks in many jurisdictions\nWe have operations in many countries, and a significant portion of our revenue is derived from countries outside of the United States.  As a result, our operations, and our financial results, including our ability to design, develop, or sell products, may be adversely affected by a number of factors outside of our control, including:\n•\nglobal and local economic conditions;\n•\nthe demand and cost of commodities, such as corn and oil;\n•\nthe strength of the agricultural, engineering, and construction markets;\n•\ninadequate infrastructure and other disruptions, such as supply chain interruptions and large-scale outages or unreliable provision of services from utilities, transportation, data hosting, or telecommunications providers;\n•\ngovernment restrictions on our operations in any country, or restrictions on our ability to repatriate earnings from a particular country;\n•\ndiffering employment practices and labor issues;\n•\nformal or informal imposition of new or revised export and/or import and doing-business regulations, including trade sanctions, tariffs, and import or export licensing requirements, which could be changed without notice;\n•\nineffective legal protection of our IP rights in certain countries;\n•\nuncertain economic and political conditions in countries where we do business;\n•\nlocal business and cultural factors that differ from our normal standards and practices;\n•\ndiffering regional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\nuncertainty regarding social, political, immigration, and trade policies in the U.S. and abroad.\nThere is an inherent risk that political, diplomatic, or military events could result in trade disruptions, including tariffs, trade embargoes, export restrictions, and other trade barriers.  A significant trade disruption or the establishment or increase of any trade barrier in any area where we do business could increase the cost of our products, which could adversely impact the margin that we earn on sales, make our products more expensive for customers or create uncertainty around demand for certain types of products, which could make our products less competitive and reduce customer demand.\nGiven the geopolitical climate, there is uncertainty about the trade policies, treaties, government regulations, and tariffs that could apply to trade.  If ther\ne were to be a deterioration in the global economy, the economies of the countries or regions where our customers are located or do business, or the industries that we or our customers serve, the demand for our products and services would likely decrease.  In addition, government or customer efforts, attitudes, laws or policies may lead to non-U.S. customers favoring domestic suppliers that could compete with or replace our products, which would also have an adverse effect on our business.  Changes in economic conditions and political uncertainty surrounding international trade also make it difficult to make financial forecasts.\nRisks associated with engaging in international business include:\n•\nlonger payment cycles and difficulties in enforcing agreements and collecting receivables through certain foreign legal systems;\n•\ndifficulties and costs of staffing and managing international operations;\n•\ndiffering local customer product preferences and requirements than our U.S. markets;\n•\ndifficulties protecting or procuring intellectual property rights; and\n•\ncompliance with changes in local laws, including those relating to privacy, labor and local content.\nThese factors or any combination of these factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf we are unable to effectively integrate, streamline and manage our increasingly diverse and complex businesses and operations, our ability to generate growth and revenue from new or existing customers may be adversely affected\nBecause our operations are geographically diverse and increasingly complex, our personnel resources and infrastructure could become strained, and our reputation in the market and our ability to successfully manage and grow our business may be adversely affected.  The size, complexity, and diverse nature of our business and the expansion of our product lines and customer base have placed increased demands on our management and operations, and future growth may place additional strains on our resources in the future.  Our ability to effectively compete and to manage our planned future growth will depend on, among other things, the following:\n•\nmaintaining continuity in our senior management and key personnel;\n•\nincreasing the productivity of our existing employees;\n•\nattracting, retaining, training, and motivating our employees, particularly our technical and management personnel;\n•\ndeploying our solutions using third party information systems, which may require changes to our applications, documentation, and operational processes;\n•\nimproving our operational, financial, and management controls; and\n•\nimproving our information reporting systems and procedures.\n18\nWe have increasingly diversified the nature of our businesses both organically and by acquisition.  As a result, an increasing amount of our business involves business models that require managerial techniques and skill sets that are different from those required to manage our historical core businesses.\nPursuant to our Connect and Scale strategy, we are investing substantial resources in integrating our product offerings and transitioning our businesses to common core services and systems in order to achieve economies of scale, simplify our operations, and improve the customer experience.  These efforts may result in disruptions to our operations,\nwhich could have an adverse effect on our customers, may cost more than we anticipate increasing our expenses, and take longer than planned.\nThese factors or a combination of these factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nChanges in our software and subscription businesses may adversely impact our operations and financial results\nAn increasing portion of our revenue is generated through software maintenance and subscription revenue, which includes Software as a Service (“SaaS”) and new subscription services for integrated solutions.  Our customers have no obligation to renew their agreements for our software maintenance or subscription services after the expiration of their initial contract period, which typically ranges from one to three years.  This shift reflects both an increasing use of subscription models for new products, and a transition for some existing products from perpetual license sales and distribution in favor of SaaS or other subscription offerings.\nOur customer acquisition and renewal rates may decline or fluctuate as a result of a number of factors, including overall economic conditions, the health of their businesses, competitive offerings, and customer dissatisfaction with our services.  Customer satisfaction with our services is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to security, reliability, performance, concerns about data privacy, current subscription terms, customer preference, and industry adoption.  If customers do not renew their contracts for our products, our maintenance and subscription revenue will decline, and our financial results will suffer.\nOur subscription models provide our customers the right to access certain of our software in a hosted environment or use downloaded software for a specified subscription period.  Market acceptance of such offerings is affected by a variety of factors, including but not limited to security, reliability, performance, current license terms, customer preference and industry adoption, social/community engagement, customer concerns with entrusting a third party to store and manage their data, public concerns regarding privacy and the enactment of restrictive laws or regulations.  If we are unable to successfully market and support our subscription offerings, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nWe continually re-evaluate our software licensing programs and subscription programs, including specific license models, delivery methods, and terms and conditions.  Changes to our licensing programs and subscription programs, including the introduction of new subscription services for integrated solutions that include hardware, the timing of the release of enhancements, upgrades, maintenance releases, the term of the contract, discounts, and promotions, could impact the timing of the recognition of revenue for our products, and adversely affect our cash flow, operating results, and financial condition.\nWe may not be able to enter into or maintain important alliances and distribution relationships\nWe believe that in certain business opportunities, our success will depend on our ability to form and maintain alliances with industry participants, such as Caterpillar, Nikon, Hilti, and CNH Industrial.  Our failure to form and maintain such alliances, or the preemption or disruption of such alliances by actions of competitors, could adversely affect our ability to sell our products to customers.  Our relationships with substantial industry participants such as Caterpillar and CNH Industrial are complex and multifaceted and are likely to evolve over time based upon the changing business needs and objectives of the parties.  Evolution of our respective business strategies and diversification of product portfolios may lead to increased competition with our strategic allies, placing additional pressure on these relationships.  Since these strategic relationships contribute to significant ongoing business in certain of our important markets, changes in these relationships could adversely affect our sales.  In addition, we utilize dealer networks, including those affiliated with some of our strategic allies such as Caterpillar and CNH Industrial to market, sell, and service many of our products.\nTo develop and expand our distribution channels, we must continue to expand and improve our processes and procedures that support our distribution channels, including our investment in systems and training, and those processes and procedures may become increasingly complex and difficult to manage.  The time and expense required for sales and marketing organizations of our channel partners to become familiar with our product offerings, including our new product developments, and newer types of offering, such as subscription programs for integrated solutions that include hardware, software maintenance, and other recurring services, may make it more difficult to introduce those products to end users and delay end-user adoption, which could result in lower revenue.\n19\nDisruption of dealer coverage within specific geographic or end-user markets could cause difficulties in marketing, selling, or servicing our products and have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.  Lastly, dealers who carry products that compete with our products may focus their inventory purchases and sales efforts on goods provided by competitors due to industry demand or profitability.  Such sourcing decisions can adversely impact our sales, financial condition, an\nd results of operations.\nInvesting in and integrating new acquisitions or divesting businesses could be costly, place a significant strain on our management systems and resources, or fail to deliver expected outcomes, which could adversely impact our results of operations\nWe typically acquire a number of businesses each year and intend to continue to acquire other businesses.  Acquisitions entail numerous risks, including:\n•\npotential inability to successfully integrate acquired operations and products or to realize cost savings or other anticipated benefits from integration;\n•\nloss of key employees or customers of acquired operations;\n•\ndifficulty of assimilating geographically dispersed operations and personnel of the acquired companies;\n•\npotential disruption of our business or the acquired business;\n•\nunanticipated expenses related to acquisitions;\n•\nunanticipated difficulties in conforming business practices, policies, procedures, internal controls, and financial records of acquisitions with our own business;\n•\nimpairment of relationships with employees, customers, vendors, distributors or business partners of either an acquired company or our own business;\n•\ninability to accurately forecast the performance of recently acquired businesses, resulting in unforeseen adverse effects on our operating results;\n•\npotential liabilities, including liabilities resulting from known or unknown compliance or legal issues, associated with an acquired business; and\n•\nadverse accounting impact to our results of operations because of purchase accounting treatment and the business or accounting practices of acquired companies.\nAny such effects from acquisitions could be costly and place a significant strain on our management systems and resources.\nAs a result of acquisitions, we have significant assets that include goodwill and other purchased intangibles.  The testing of goodwill and intangibles for impairment under generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make significant judgments and assumptions.  Changes in business conditions or in the prospects or results of operations of the acquired business could require adjustments to the valuation of these assets resulting in impairments that would adversely affect our results.  In addition, changes in the operating results or the valuation of companies in which we have investments may have a direct impact on our financial statements or could result in our having to write down the value of such investment.\nEven if successfully negotiated and closed, acquisitions may not yield expected synergies, may not advance our business strategy as expected, may fall short of expected return-on-investment targets, or may not prove successful or effective for our business.  Companies that we acquire may operate with different cost and margin structures, which could further cause fluctuations in our operating results and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nFrom time to time we have divested businesses, and we expect to do so in the future.\nAny such divestiture may result in:\n•\na disruption of our business;\n•\nreduced synergies, including the loss of scale or key employees;\n•\nimpairment of customer relationships; and\n•\nreductions in the breadth of our product offerings.\nDivestitures may adversely impact our results if we are unable to offset the dilutive impacts from the loss of revenue associated with the divested products or businesses, or mitigate overhead costs allocated to those businesses.  We could also experience higher than expected transaction costs and write-offs of significant amounts of goodwill.\n20\nWe face substantial competition in our markets, which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our financial condition and results of operations\nOur markets are highly competitive, and we expect that both direct and indirect competition will increase in the future.  Our overall competitive position depends on a number of factors including the price, quality and performance of our products, the effectiveness of our distribution channel and direct sales force, the level of customer service, the development of new technology, and our ability to participate in emerging markets.  Within each of our markets, we encounter direct competition from other GNSS, software, optical, and laser suppliers, and competition may intensify from various larger U.S. and non-U.S. competitors and new market entrants, particularly from markets such as China.  Our products, which commonly use GNSS for basic location information, may be subject to competition from alternative location technologies such as simultaneous location and mapping technology.  In our software and subscription services businesses, we face competition from a group of large, well-established companies, particularly in the areas of design, enterprise resource planning (“ERP”), and collaboration and project management solutions.  Our integrated hardware and software products may be subject to increasing competition from mass market devices such as smartphones and tablets used in conjunction with relatively inexpensive applications, which have not been heavily used for commercial applications in the past.\nThese competitive developments may require us to rapidly adapt to technological and customer preference changes that we have not previously been exposed to, including those related to cloud computing, mobile devices, and new computing platforms.  Such competition has in the past resulted, and in the future may result, in price reductions, reduced margins, or loss of market share, any of which could decrease our revenue and growth rates or impair our operating results and financial condition.  We believe that our ability to compete successfully in the future against existing and additional competitors will depend largely on our ability to execute our strategy to provide products with significantly differentiated features compared to currently available products.  We may not be able to implement this strategy successfully, and our products may not be competitive with other technologies or products that may be developed by our competitors, many of whom have significantly greater financial, technical, manufacturing, marketing, sales, and other resources than we do.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel, our business, operating results, financial condition, and cash flows could be harmed\nOur continued success depends, in part, on our ability to hire and retain qualified personnel and to advance our corporate strategy, and preserve the key aspects of our corporate culture.  Because our future success is dependent on our ability to continue to enhance and introduce new products, we are particularly dependent on our ability to hire and retain qualified engineers, including in areas of technology such as GNSS, software programming, information systems, and data analytics.  In addition, to increase revenues, we will be required to increase the size and productivity of our sales and channel management groups.  Competition for qualified employees in our major locations is intense.  The COVID-19 pandemic has also heavily impacted the environment for attracting and managing employees, and our failure to successfully manage these changes and navigate transitions such as return to office could harm our ability to attract and retain the best talent.  Our inability to hire and retain qualified management and skilled personnel, particularly engineers, salespeople, and key executive management, could disrupt our development efforts, sales results, business relationships, and our ability to execute our business plan and strategy on a timely basis and could materially and adversely affect our operating results, financial condition, and cash flows.\nEquity grants are a critical component of our current compensation programs.  If we fail to grant equity competitively, we may have difficulty attracting and retaining critical employees.  In addition, because of our sales structure, cash, and equity incentive compensation plans, we may be at increased risk of losing employees at certain times.  For example, the retention value of our compensation plans decreases after the payment of periodic bonuses or the vesting of equity awards.\nRisks related to our technology and products\nOur products are highly technical and may contain undetected errors, product defects, security vulnerabilities, or software errors\nOur products, including our software products, are highly technical and complex and, when deployed, may contain errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities.  We must develop our products quickly to keep pace with the rapidly changing market, and we have a history of frequently introducing new products.  Products and services as sophisticated as ours could contain undetected errors or defects, especially when first introduced or when new models or versions are released.  Such occurrences could result in damage to our reputation, lost revenue, diverted development resources, increased customer service and support costs, warranty claims, and litigation.\nWe warrant that our products will be free of defect for various periods of time, depending on the product.  In addition, certain of our contracts include epidemic failure clauses.  If invoked, these clauses may entitle the customer to return or obtain credits for products and inventory, or to cancel outstanding purchase orders even if the products themselves are not defective.\n21\nErrors, viruses, or bugs may be present in software or hardware that we acquire or license from third parties and incorporate into our products or in third-party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our products.  Our customers’ proprietary software and network firewall protections may corrupt data from our products and create difficulties in implementing our solutions.  Changes to third-party software or hardware that our customers use in conjunction with our software could also render our applications inoperable.  Any errors, defects, or security vulnerabilities in our products or any defects in, or compatibility issues with, any third-party hardware or software or customers’ network environments discovered after commercial release could result in loss of revenue or delay in revenue recognition, loss of customers, theft of trade secrets, data or intellectual property and increased service and warranty cost, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nUndiscovered vulnerabilities in our products alone or in combination with third-party hardware or software could expose them to hackers or other unscrupulous third parties who develop and deploy viruses and other malicious software programs that could attack our products.  Actual or perceived security vulnerabilities in our products could harm our reputation and lead some customers to return products, to reduce or delay future purchases, or use competitive products.\nOur internal and customer-facing systems, and systems of third parties we rely upon, may be subject to cybersecurity breaches, disruptions, or delays\nA cybersecurity incident in our own systems or the systems of our third-party providers may compromise the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of our own internal data, the availability of our products and websites designed to support our customers, or our customer data.  Computer hackers, foreign governments, cybercriminals, or cyber terrorists may attempt to or succeed in penetrating our network security and our website.  The discovery of wide-scale cybersecurity intrusions into U.S. government and private company computer networks by alleged Russian state actors and the mobilization of large-scale cybercrime actors using ransomware and other techniques underscore the ongoing threat posed by sophisticated private and foreign state-sponsored attacks.  Unauthorized access to our proprietary business information or customer data may be obtained through break-ins, sabotage, breach of our secure network by an unauthorized party, computer viruses, computer denial-of-service attacks, employee theft or misuse, breach of the security of the networks of our third-party providers, or other misconduct.  Additionally, outside parties may attempt to fraudulently induce employees or users to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to data.\nWe have experienced security breaches in the past, and despite our efforts to maintain the security and integrity of our systems, it is impossible to eliminate this risk.  Because the techniques used by computer hackers who may attempt to penetrate and sabotage our network security or our website change frequently, they may take advantage of weaknesses in third party technology or standards of which we are unaware or that we do not control and may not be recognized until long after they have been launched against a target.  We may be unable to anticipate or counter these techniques.  It is also possible that unauthorized access to customer data or confidential information may be obtained through inadequate use of security controls by customers, vendors, or business partners.  Efforts to prevent hackers from disrupting our service or otherwise accessing our systems are expensive to develop, implement, and maintain.  Such efforts require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become more sophisticated and may limit the functionality of, or otherwise adversely impact our service offering and systems.  A cybersecurity incident affecting our systems may also result in theft of our intellectual property, proprietary data, or trade secrets, which would compromise our competitive position, reputation, and operating results.  We also may be required to notify regulators about any actual or perceived personal data breach (including the EU Lead Data Protection Authority) as well as the individuals who are affected by the incident within strict time periods.\nThe systems we rely upon also remain vulnerable to damage or interruption from a number of other factors, including access to the internet, the failure of our network or software systems, or significant variability in visitor traffic on our product websites, earthquakes, floods, fires, power loss, telecommunication failures, computer viruses, human error, and similar events or disruptions.  Some of our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for all eventualities.  Our systems are also subject to intentional acts of vandalism.  Despite any precautions we may take, the occurrence of a natural disaster, a decision by any of our third-party hosting providers to close a facility we use without adequate notice for financial or other reasons, or other unanticipated problems at our hosting facilities could cause system interruptions and delays, and result in loss of critical data and lengthy interruptions in our services.\nWe rely on our information systems and those of third parties for activities such as processing customer orders, delivery of products, hosting and providing services and support to our customers, billing and tracking our customers, hosting and managing our customer data, and otherwise running our business.  Any disruptions or unexpected incompatibilities in our information systems and those of the third parties upon whom we rely could have a significant impact on our business.\n22\nAn increasing portion of our revenue comes from SaaS solutions and other hosted services in which we store, retrieve, communicate, and manage data that is critical to our customers’ business systems.  Disruption of our systems that support these services and solutions could cause disruptions in our customers’ systems and in the businesses that rely on these systems.  Any such disruptions could harm our reputation, create liabilities to our customers, hurt demand for our services and solutions, and adversely impact our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on new products and services, and if we are unable to successfully introduce them into the market or to effectively compete with new, disruptive product alternatives, our customer base may decline or fail to grow as anticipated\nOur future revenue stream depends to a large degree on our ability to bring new products and services to market on a timely basis.  We must continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to develop new products and services, enhance existing products, and achieve market acceptance of such products and services.\nWe may encounter problems in the future in innovating and introducing new products and services.\nOur development stage products may not be successfully completed or, if developed, may not achieve significant customer acceptance.  Development and manufacturing schedules for technology products are difficult to predict, and we might not achieve our goals as to the timing of introducing new technology products or could encounter increased costs.  The timely availability and cost-effective production of these products in volume and their acceptance by customers are important to our future success.  This has been and may continue to be negatively impacted by the global supply chain shortage.  If we are unable to introduce new products and services, if other companies develop competing technology products and services, or if we do not develop compelling new products and services, our number of customers may not grow as anticipated, or may decline, which could harm our operating results.  Many of our offerings are increasingly focused on software and subscription services.  The software industry is characterized by rapidly changing customer preferences, which require us to address multiple delivery platforms, new mobile devices, and cloud computing.  Life cycles of software products can be short, and this can exacerbate the risks associated with developing new products.  The introduction of third party solutions embodying new, disruptive technologies and the emergence of new industry standards could make our existing and future software solutions and other products obsolete or non-competitive.  If we are not able to develop software and other solutions that address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers, or if we are unable to adapt to new platforms, technologies, or new industry standards that impact our markets, our ability to retain or increase market share and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nSome of our products rely on third-party technologies including open-source software, which could result in product incompatibilities or harm availability of our products and services\nWe license software, technologies, and intellectual property underlying some of our software from third parties.  The third-party licenses we rely upon may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, or at all, and the software and technologies may not be appropriately supported, maintained, or enhanced by the licensors, resulting in development delays.  Some software licenses are subject to annual renewals at the discretion of the licensors.  In some cases, if we were to breach a provision of these license agreements, the licensor could terminate the agreement immediately.  The loss of licenses to, or inability to support, maintain, and enhance, any such third-party software or technology could result in increased costs, or delays in software releases or updates, until such issues have been resolved.  This could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe also incorporate open-source software into our products.  Although we monitor our use of open-source software, the terms of many open-source licenses have not been interpreted by U.S. courts, and there is a risk that such licenses could be construed in a manner that could impose unanticipated conditions or restrictions on our ability to market or sell our products or to develop new products.  In such event, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties in order to continue offering our products, to disclose and offer royalty-free licenses in connection with our own source code, to re-engineer our products, or to discontinue the sale of our products in the event re-engineering cannot be accomplished on a timely basis, any of which could adversely affect our business.\nWe are dependent on proprietary technology, which could result in litigation that could divert significant valuable resources\nOur future success and competitive position is dependent upon our proprietary technology, and we rely on patent, trade secret, trademark, and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property.  The patents owned or licensed by us may be invalidated, circumvented, infringed, or challenged.  The rights granted under these patents may not provide competitive advantages to us.  Any of our pending or future patent applications may not be issued within the scope of the claims sought by us, if at all.\nDespite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain our software or develop software with the same functionality or to obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary.  Others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology, duplicate our technology, or design around the patents owned by us.  In addition, effective copyright, patent, and trade secret protection may be unavailable, limited, or not applied for in certain countries.  The steps taken by us to protect our technology might not prevent the misappropriation of such technology.\n23\nThe value of our products relies substantially on our technical innovation in fields in which there are many current patent filings.  Third parties may claim that we or our customers (some of whom are indemnified by us) are infringing their intellectual property rights.  For example, individuals and groups may purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of asserting claims of infringement and attempting to extract settlements from us or our customers.  The number of these types of claims has increased in recent years.  As new patents are issued or are brought to our attention by the holders of such patents, it may be necessary for us to secure a license from such patent holders, redesign our products, or withdraw products from the market.  In addition, the legal costs and engineering time required to safeguard intellectual property or to defend against litigation could become a significant expense of operations.  Any such litigation could require us to incur substantial costs and divert significant valuable resources, including the efforts of our technical and management personnel, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nWe are dependent on the availability and unimpaired use of allocated bands within the radio frequency spectrum; our products may be subject to harmful interference from new or modified spectrum uses\nOur GNSS technology is dependent on the use of satellite signals and on terrestrial communication bands.  International allocations of radio frequency are made by the International Telecommunications Union (“ITU”), a specialized technical agency of the United Nations.  These allocations are further governed by radio regulations that have treaty status and which may be subject to modification every two to three years by the World Radio Communication Conference.  Each country also has regulatory authority over how each band is used in the country.  In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (“FCC”) and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration share responsibility for radio frequency allocations and spectrum usage regulations.\nAny ITU or local reallocation of radio frequency bands, including frequency band segmentation and sharing of spectrum, or other modifications of the permitted uses of relevant frequency bands, may materially and adversely affect the utility and reliability of our products and have significant adverse impacts on our customers, both of which could reduce demand for our products.  For example, in 2020 the FCC approved a proposal by a private party to repurpose spectrum adjacent to the authorized GNSS bands for terrestrial wireless operations throughout the United States.  The company has opposed and continues to oppose this proposal, along with a wide range of participants in commercial and governmental sectors that rely on the use of GNSS in their critical activities.  The FCC’s action is subject to further review as well as potential legislative action.  If the FCC’s action continues in effect and terrestrial operations are implemented in the affected spectrum, these operations could create harmful interference to GNSS receivers in proximity to such operations and impose costs to retrofit or replace affected receivers.  Similarly, other countries have considered proposals for use of frequencies used by our products as well as adjacent bands that could cause harmful interference to our products.\nMany of our products use other radio frequency bands, such as the public land mobile radio bands, together with the GNSS signal, to provide enhanced GNSS capabilities, such as real-time kinematics precision.  The continuing availability of these non-GNSS radio frequencies is essential to provide enhanced GNSS products to our precision survey, agriculture, and construction machine controls markets.  In addition, transmissions and emissions from other services and equipment operating in adjacent frequency bands or in-band may impair the utility and reliability of our products.  Any regulatory changes in spectrum allocation or in allowable operating conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nMany of our products rely on GNSS technology, GPS and other satellite systems, which may become degraded or inoperable and result in lost revenue\nGNSS technology, GPS satellites, and their ground support systems are complex electronic systems subject to electronic and mechanical failures and possible intentional disruption.  Many of the GPS satellites currently in orbit were originally designed to have lives of 7.5 years and are subject to damage by the hostile space environment in which they operate.  However, of the current deployment of operational satellites in orbit, some have been in operation for 15 years or more.  Repair of damaged or malfunctioning satellites is currently not economically feasible.  If a significant number of satellites were to become inoperable, there could be a substantial delay before they are replaced with new satellites.  A reduction in the number of operating satellites below the 24-satellite standard established for GPS may impair the utility of the GPS system and the growth of current and additional market opportunities.  In addition, software updates to GPS satellites and ground control segments, and infrequent known events such as GPS week number rollover, may adversely affect our products and customers.  We depend on public access to open technical specifications in advance of system updates to mitigate these problems, which may not be available or complete.\nWe are dependent on continued operation of GPS, the principal GNSS currently in operation.  The GPS constellation is operated by the U. S. Government, which is committed to maintenance and improvement of GPS.  If supporting policies were to change, or if user fees were imposed, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n24\nMany of our products also use signals from systems that augment GPS, such as the Wide Area Augmentation System and National Differential GPS System, and satellites transmitting signal corrections data on mobile satellite services frequencies utilized by our RTX corrections services.  Some of these augmentation systems are operated by the U.S. government and rely on continued funding and maintenance of these systems.  Any curtailment of the operating capability of these systems or limitations on access to, or use of the signals, or discontinuance of service could result in degradation of our services or product performance, with an adverse effect on our business.\nMany of our products use satellite signals from the Russian GLONASS, China’s BeiDou, and the European Galileo GNSS Systems.  Other countries, such as India, are in the process of creating their own GNSS systems, and we either have developed or will develop products that use GNSS signals from these systems.\nNational or European authorities may provide preferential access to signals to companies associated with their markets, including our competitors, which could harm our competitive position.\nUse of non-U.S. GNSS signals are also subject to FCC waiver requirements and to restrictions based upon international trade or geopolitical considerations.  If we are unable to develop timely and competitive commercial products using these systems, or obtain timely and equal access to service signals, this could result in lost revenue.  These authorities may also adopt protectionist measures favoring national companies who make use of their GNSS systems, to the detriment of our products using the U.S. GPS system, which could harm our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nRegulatory risks\nWe face risks inherent in conducting business internationally, including compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations\nThese laws and regulations include data privacy requirements, labor relations laws, tax laws, anti-competition regulations, import and trade restrictions, export control laws, and laws that prohibit corrupt payments to governmental officials or certain payments or remunerations to customers, including the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”), the U.K. Bribery Act, and other anti-corruption laws, that have been the subject of a substantial increase in global enforcement.  Many of our products are subject to U.S. export law restrictions that limit the destinations and types of customers to which our products may be sold or that require an export license in connection with sales outside the United States.  Given the high level of complexity of these laws, there is a risk that some provisions may be inadvertently or intentionally breached, for example through fraudulent or negligent behavior of individual employees, our failure to comply with certain formal documentation requirements or otherwise.  Also, we may be held liable for actions taken by our local dealers and partners.  Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or our employees, and prohibitions or conditions on the conduct of our business.  Any such violations could include prohibitions or conditions on our ability to offer our products in one or more countries and could materially damage our reputation, our brand, our international expansion efforts, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, and our results of operations.\nWe operate in many parts of the world that have experienced significant governmental corruption to some degree and, in certain circumstances, strict compliance with anti-bribery laws may conflict with local customs and practices.  We may be subject to competitive disadvantages to the extent that our competitors are able to secure business, licenses, or other preferential treatment by making payments to government officials and others in positions of influence or through other methods that relevant law and regulations prohibit us from using.  Our success depends, in part, on our ability to anticipate these risks and manage these difficulties.\nWe are subject to evolving privacy laws in the United States and other jurisdictions that are subject to potentially differing interpretations and which could adversely impact our business and require that we incur substantial costs\nExisting privacy-related laws and regulations in the United States and other countries are evolving and are subject to potentially differing interpretations, and various U.S. federal and state or other international legislative and regulatory bodies may expand or enact laws regarding privacy and data security-related matters.  New privacy laws have come into effect in Brazil and New Zealand in 2020 and in China in 2021, and revisions of privacy laws are currently pending in countries like Canada and India.  Some countries are considering or have passed legislation that requires local storage and processing of data, including geospatial data, which could impact our ability to deliver cloud-based solutions in an efficient manner.  The U.S. and European Union have not yet managed to replace the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield as a basis for data transfers from the EU to the U.S.  International transfers of personal data present ongoing compliance challenges and complicate our business transactions and operations.  In addition, the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “CCPA”), which took effect in January 2020, was\namended by\nthe California Privacy Rights Act (“the “CPRA”) and will take full effect in January 2023.  The CCPA and CPRA, among other things, gives California residents expanded rights to access and delete their personal information, opt out of certain personal information sharing, and receive detailed information about how their personal information is used.  Other U.S. states and the U.S. Congress have introduced, and some states like Virginia and Colorado have enacted in 2021, data privacy legislation, which may impact our business.  Data privacy legislation, amendments and revisions to existing data privacy legislation, and other developments impacting data privacy and data protection may require us to modify our data processing\n25\npractices and policies, increase the complexity of providing our products and services, and cause us to incur substantial costs in an effort to comply.  Failure to comply may lead to significant fines and business interruption.\nWe are subject to the impact of governmental and other certifications processes and regulations, which could adversely affect our products and our business\nWe market many products that are subject to governmental regulations and certifications before they can be sold.  The European Union increasingly regulates the use of our products on agriculture, construction, and other types of machinery.  As we develop and enhance features which support automated and autonomous operation of our products, we are increasingly subject to functional safety regulation.  CE certification is required for GNSS receivers and data communications products, which must also conform to the European harmonized GNSS receiver requirements and the radio equipment directive to be sold in the European community.  In the future, the U.S., European, or other governmental authorities may propose GPS receiver testing and certification for compliance with published GPS signal interface or other specifications.  Governmental authorities may also propose other forms of GPS receiver performance standards, which may limit design alternatives, hamper product innovation, or impose additional costs.  Some of our products that use integrated radio communication technology require product type certification and some products require an end user to obtain licensing from the FCC and other national authorities for frequency-band usage.  Compliance with evolving product regulations in our major markets could require that we redesign our products, cease selling products in certain markets, and increase our costs of product development.  An inability to obtain required certifications in a timely manner could adversely affect our ability to bring our products to market and harm our customer relationships.  Failure to comply with evolving requirements could result in fines and limitations on sales of our products.\nFinancial and tax risks\nOur debt could adversely affect our cash flow and prevent us from fulfilling our financial obligations\nAt the end of 2021, our total debt was comprised primarily of senior notes of approximately $1.3 billion.  When our senior notes mature, we will have to utilize significant resources to repay these senior notes or seek to refinance them.  If we decide to refinance the senior notes, we may be required to do so on different or less favorable terms, or we may be unable to refinance the senior notes at all, both of which may adversely affect our financial condition.  Any downgrade by credit rating agencies could adversely affect our cost of borrowing, limit our access to the capital markets, or result in more restrictive covenants in future debt agreements.\nOur outstanding indebtedness could have other important consequences, such as:\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate a portion of our cash flow from operations and other capital resources to debt service, thereby reducing our ability to fund working capital, capital expenditures, general corporate purposes, and other cash requirements, particularly if the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations were revised downward;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nreducing our ability to make investments and acquisitions, which support the growth of the company, or to repurchase shares of our common stock; and\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to changes and opportunities in our industry, which may place us at a competitive disadvantage.\nThere are various financial covenants and other restrictions in our debt instruments.  If we fail to comply with any of these requirements, the related indebtedness (and other unrelated indebtedness) could become due and payable prior to its stated maturity, and we may not be able to repay the indebtedness that becomes due.  A default under our debt instruments may also significantly affect our ability to obtain additional or alternative financing.\nOur ability to make scheduled payments or to refinance our obligations with respect to indebtedness will depend on our operating and financial performance, which in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, and other factors beyond our control.  A portion of our outstanding debt has interest rates that float based on prevailing interest rates, and we may incur additional variable-rate debt in the future.  Such rates tend to fluctuate based on general economic conditions, general interest rates, Federal Reserve rates, and the supply of and demand for credit in the relevant interbanking market.\nIf interest rates increase, our interest expense will also increase as would the costs of refinancing existing indebtedness or obtaining new debt.\nOur ability to incur additional indebtedness over time may be limited due to applicable financial covenants and restrictions, and due to the risk that significantly increasing our level of indebtedness could impact the ratings assigned to our debt securities by rating organizations, which in turn would increase the interest rates and fees that we pay in connection with our indebtedness.\n26\nChanges in our effective tax rate may reduce our net income in future periods\nWe are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions.  Significant judgment is required to determine and estimate worldwide tax liabilities.  While we believe our tax positions are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business, it is possible that these positions may be contested or overturned by jurisdictional tax authorities, which may have a significant impact on our global provision for income taxes.  Our effective tax rate is primarily subject to the geographic mix of earnings, statutory rates, inter-company transfer pricing, and enacted tax laws.\nA number of factors may increase our future effective tax rates, including:\n•\nthe jurisdictions in which profits are determined to be earned and taxed;\n•\nthe resolution of issues arising from tax audits with the U.S. and foreign tax authorities;\n•\nchanges in our intercompany transfer pricing methodology;\n•\nchanges in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities;\n•\nincreases in expense not deductible for tax purposes, including transaction costs and impairments of goodwill in connection with acquisitions;\n•\nchanges in the realizability of available tax credits;\n•\nchanges in share-based compensation;\n•\nchanges in tax laws or the interpretation of such tax laws; and\n•\nchanges in generally accepted accounting principles.\nTax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied, and governmental tax authorities are increasingly scrutinizing the tax positions of companies.\nThe jurisdictions where we do business may change tax laws, regulations, and interpretations on a prospective or retroactive basis and these potential changes could adversely affect our effective tax rates.  As these and other tax laws and related regulations change, our financial results could be materially impacted.  Given the unpredictability of these possible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess whether the overall effect of such potential tax changes would be cumulatively positive or negative for our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could impact our financial results.\nIn October 2021, the Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development (“OECD”) announced that many world leaders tentatively signed on to a framework that imposes a minimum tax of 15% to certain multinational enterprises.  We will continue to monitor and assess how this may impact our financial results if and when implemented.\nWe are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations by state and foreign taxing authorities.  If taxing authorities of any jurisdiction were to successfully challenge a material tax position, we could become subject to higher taxes and our earnings could be adversely affected.\nWe may be affected by fluctuations in currency exchange rates\nWe are potentially exposed to adverse as well as beneficial movements in currency exchange rates.  Although the majority of our sales are transacted in U.S. dollars, expenses may be paid in local currencies.  An increase in the value of the dollar could increase the real cost to our customers of our products in those markets outside the U.S. where we sell in dollars, and a weakened dollar could increase the cost of local operating expenses, procurement of raw materials from sources outside the U.S., and overseas capital expenditures.  We also conduct certain investing and financing activities in local currencies.  Our foreign exchange forward contracts reduce, but do not eliminate, the impact of currency exchange rate movements; therefore, changes in exchange rates could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks related to ownership of our stock\nThe volatility of our stock price could adversely affect an investment in our common stock\nThe market price of our common stock has been, and may continue to be, highly volatile.  During 2021, our stock price ranged from\n$65.91 to $95.72.\nWe believe that a variety of factors could cause the price of our common stock to fluctuate, perhaps substantially, including:\n•\ngeneral conditions in the worldwide economy;\n•\nquarterly fluctuations in our actual or anticipated operating results and order levels;\n•\nannouncements and reports of developments related to our business, our major customers and partners, and the industries in which we compete, or the industries in which our customers compete;\n•\nsecurity breaches;\n•\nacquisition announcements;\n•\nnew products or product enhancements announced or introduced by us or our competitors;\n•\ndisputes with respect to developments in patents or other intellectual property rights;\n•\ndevelopments in our relationships with our partners, customers, and suppliers;\n•\nthe imposition of tariffs or other trade barriers;\n27\n•\npolitical, economic, or social uncertainty;\n•\nglobal pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\nacts of terrorism.\nIn addition, the stock market in general and the markets for shares of “high-tech” companies in particular have frequently experienced extreme price fluctuations, which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies.  Any such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur annual and quarterly performance may fluctuate, which could adversely impact our operations, financial results, and stock price\nOur operating results have fluctuated and can be expected to continue to fluctuate in the future on a quarterly and annual basis as a result of a number of factors, many of which are beyond our control.  Results in any period could be affected by:\n•\nchanges in market demand;\n•\ncompetitive market conditions;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions;\n•\nthe timing of recognizing revenue;\n•\nfluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;\n•\nthe cost and availability of components;\n•\nthe mix of our customer base and sales channels;\n•\nthe mix of products sold;\n•\npricing of products;\n•\nchanges in the U.S. or foreign policies on taxes, trade, or spending;\n•\nregional responses and restrictions related to global pandemics, like the COVID-19 pandemic; and\n•\nother risks, including those described below.\nSeasonal variations in demand for our products may also affect our quarterly results.  Construction equipment revenue has historically been the highest in early spring.  Our agricultural equipment revenue has historically been the highest in the first quarter, followed by the second quarter, reflecting buying in anticipation of the spring planting season in the Northern hemisphere.  If we do not accurately forecast seasonal demand, we may be left with unsold inventory or have a shortage of inventory, which could adversely impact our results of operations.\nDue in part to the buying patterns of our customers, a portion of our hardware revenue occurs from orders received and immediately shipped to customers in the last few weeks and days of each quarter, while our operating expense tends to remain fairly predictable.  These patterns could harm our operating results if for any reason expected sales are deferred, orders are not received, or shipments are delayed a few days at the end of a quarter.\nThe price of our common stock could decline substantially in the event any of these risks result in our financial performance being below the expectations of public market analysts and investors, which are based on historical and predictive models that are not necessarily accurate representations of the future.\nGeneral risk factors\nWe have claims and lawsuits against us that may result in adverse outcomes\nWe are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits.  Adverse outcomes in some or all of these claims may result in significant monetary damages or injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability to conduct business.  Litigation and other claims are subject to inherent uncertainties and the outcomes can be difficult to predict.  Management may not adequately reserve for a contingent liability, or may suffer unforeseen liabilities, which could then impact the results of a financial period.  A material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period in which the effect of an unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable which, if not expected, could harm our financial condition and results of operations.\nCatastrophic events or geopolitical conditions could disrupt our operations\nActs of war, acts of terrorism or civil unrest, natural disasters and other catastrophic events, especially any events that impact our larger markets or GNSS signals or systems, could have a material adverse impact on our business.  The threat of terrorism and war and heightened security and military activity in response to this threat, or any future acts of terrorism or hostilities, may involve a redeployment of the satellites used in GNSS or interruptions of the system.  Civil unrest, local conflicts, or other political instability may adversely impact regional economies, cause work stoppages, or result in limitations on business transactions with the affected jurisdictions.  To the extent that such interruptions result in delays or the cancellation of orders, disruption of the manufacturing or shipment of our products, or reduced demand for our products, these interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n28\nFuture public health crises and epidemics could impact our international operations and sales\nOur results of operations could be adversely affected to the extent that future pandemics, similar to COVID-19 or any other epidemic, harm any significant market where we do business.  Contagious disease epidemics or global pandemics could also significantly impact our international supply chain and result in component and product shortages and general disruptions to the economy.  Such outbreaks could also result in mass quarantines, business closures, and significantly impact our suppliers, customers, and commercial partners in affected areas, which may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\nDamage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses, competitive position, and prospects for growth\nOur ability to attract and retain investors, customers, and employees could be adversely affected by damage to our reputation resulting from various sources, including environmental, social, and governance (“ESG”) related issues; employee misconduct, litigation, or regulatory outcomes; failure to deliver minimum standards of service and quality; compliance failures; unethical behavior; unintended breach of confidential information; and the activities of our customers and commercial partners.\nIn addition, we are committed to aligning our purpose, culture, and corporate strategy with sustainability.  Any perceived change in our dedication to these commitments could harm our reputation and could adversely impact our business.  Our disclosures on these matters, and standards we set for ourselves or a failure to meet these standards, may influence our reputation and the value of our brand.\nFor example, we have elected to share publicly our commitments and ongoing efforts in our Sustainability Report, where we address the importance of ESG matters to our stakeholders and our Company.  Our business may face increased scrutiny related to these activities, including from the investment community, and our failure to achieve progress in these areas on a timely basis, or at all, could adversely affect our reputation, business, financial performance, and growth.\nClimate change may have an impact on our business\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental programs and partnering with organizations who are also focused on mitigating their own climate-related risks, we recognize that there are inherent climate-related risks wherever business is conducted.  Any of our primary locations may be vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change.  The recent wildfires in Colorado occurred in close proximity to our offices in Westminster, Colorado.  Our California headquarters has historically experienced, and is projected to continue to experience, climate-related events at an increasing frequency including drought, water scarcity, heat waves, wildfires and resultant air quality impacts and power shutoffs associated with wildfire prevention.  Furthermore, it is more difficult to mitigate the impact of these events on our employees while they work from home as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Changing market dynamics, global policy developments, and the increasing frequency and impact of extreme weather events on critical infrastructure in the U.S. and elsewhere have the potential to disrupt our business, the business of our third-party suppliers, and the business of our customers, and may cause us to experience higher attrition, losses, and additional costs to maintain or resume operations."

    "text": "Company Stock Performance\nOur common stock trades on NASDAQ under the symbol “TRMB.”  The following graph compares the cumulative five-year total return provided stockholders on our common stock relative to the cumulative total returns of the S&P 500 Index, the S&P 500 Information Technology Index, the\nS&P 500 Industrials\nIndex, and the NASDAQ Composite Index.  An investment of $100 (with reinvestment of all dividends) is assumed to have been made in our common stock and in each of the indexes on\nDecember 31, 2016, and its relative performance is tracked through December 31, 2021.\nTrimble was added to the S&P 500 during 2021.  We also added the S&P 500 Industrials Index, as both S&P 500 Information Technology and S&P 500 Industrials provide a better comparison with Trimble’s stock than either index individually.\nStock Repurchase Program\nThe following table provides information relating to our purchase of equity securities for the fourth quarter of\n2021\n:\n30\nIn August 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (“2021 Stock Repurchase Program”) authorizing up to $750.0 million in repurchases of our common stock.  Under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and supersedes and replaces the $600.0 million share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors in November 2017 (“2017 Stock Repurchase Program”), of which $50.7 million was remaining and has been cancelled.\nUnder the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, subject to business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market transactions, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, or by other means.  The timing and actual number of any shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, our share price, other available uses of capital, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.  The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time at without prior notice.\nDuring 2021, we repurchased approximately 2.1 million shares of common stock in open market purchases under our 2017 and 2021 Stock Repurchase Programs, at an average price of $85.75 per share, for a total of $180.0 million.  At the end of 2021, the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of $610.0 million.\nAs of February 18, 2022, there were approximately 520 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividend Policy\nWe have not declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock during any period for which financial information is provided in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.  At this time, we intend to retain future earnings, if any, to fund the development and growth of our business and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future."

    "text": "The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes.  The following discussion contains forward-looking statements that reflect our plans, estimates, and beliefs.  Our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forward-looking statements.  Factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include, but are not limited to, those discussed below and those listed under “Risks Factors.”  This section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020.  Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K, for the year ended January 1, 2021.\nEXECUTIVE LEVEL OVERVIEW\nWe are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes.  Our comprehensive work process solutions are used across a range of industries including architecture, building construction, civil engineering, geospatial, survey and mapping, agriculture, natural resources, utilities, transportation, and government.  Our representative customers include construction owners, contractors, engineering and construction firms, surveying companies, farmers and agricultural companies, energy and utility companies, trucking companies, and state, federal, and municipal governments.  Further information on our business is presented in Part I,\nOur growth strategy is centered on multiple elements:\n•\nExecuting on our Connect and Scale strategy;\n•\nIncreasing focus on software and services;\n•\nFocus on attractive markets with significant growth and profitability potential;\n•\nDomain knowledge and technological innovation that benefit a diverse customer base;\n•\nGeographic expansion with localization strategy;\n•\nOptimized go-to-market strategies to best access our markets;\n•\nStrategic acquisitions;\n•\nVenture fund investments; and\n•\nSustainability.\nOur focus on these growth drivers has led over time to growth in revenue and profitability and an increasingly diversified business model.  We continue to experience a shift toward a more significant mix of recurring revenue contracts, as demonstrated by our success in driving annualized recurring revenue (“ARR”) growth of 9% year-over-year at the end of 2021.  Excluding the impact of foreign currency and acquisitions and divestitures, ARR organic growth was\n12%\n.  This shift has positively impacted our revenue mix and growth over time and is leading to improved visibility in our businesses.  Our software, recurring revenue, and services represented\n55%\nof total revenue for 2021.  As our solutions have expanded, our go-to-market model has also evolved with a balanced mix between direct, distribution, and OEM customers as well as an increasing number of enterprise level customer relationships.  Additionally, in August 2021, we announced a newly formed strategic venture fund.  Through this fund, we expect to invest up to $200 million in early- to growth-stage companies that can accelerate innovation and effectively bring new solutions to our customers and industry.\nFor a full definition of ARR as used in this discussion and analysis, refer to the “Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Annualized Recurring Revenue” later in this item 7.\nImpact of COVID-19 and supply chain constraints on our business\nCOVID-19 and variant impacts, especially related to global supply chain disruptions and parts and labor shortages, and increased worldwide demand for certain components, continued to impact our business and operations.  We are experiencing extended delivery times for certain components of our hardware products and increased freight costs.  As a result, we are making binding commitments with longer lead times and procuring components at higher prices, which may impact our flexibility to adapt to changing market conditions and product demand.  Currently, we expect these challenging supply chain conditions to persist in the near term.  Therefore, we will continue to experience delays in shipping our products and increased costs, which may reduce our revenue and gross margin and continue to increase our backlog.  Our 2021 results of operations reflect significant revenue improvement as the overall impact of COVID-19 was less pronounced.  As a result of COVID-19, the year-to-year comparison of 2020 to 2021 reflects significant distortions in growth rates as our business rebounded in 2021.\nSee “1A. Risk Factors” for further discussion of the possible impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and its resulting effects on our business.\n32\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, costs of sales, operating expenses, and related disclosures.  We consider the accounting polices described below to be our critical accounting policies.  These critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies.  Our accounting policies are more fully described in Note 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration that we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers.  We enter into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations; however, determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment.\nJudgment is required to determine stand-alone selling price (“SSP”) for each distinct performance obligation.  We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are a U.S. based multinational company operating in multiple U.S. and foreign jurisdictions.  Judgment is required in evaluating our uncertain tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes.  We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes.  Determining whether an uncertain tax position is effectively settled requires judgment.  Changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if we believe it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.\nWe are subject to the periodic examination of our domestic and foreign tax returns by the IRS, state, local, and foreign tax authorities who may challenge our tax positions.  We regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes.\nBusiness Combinations and Valuation of Goodwill and Purchased Intangible Assets\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby certain identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.  Acquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen determining the fair values of certain assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially concerning intangible assets.  Critical estimates when valuing intangible assets include expected future cash flows based on consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates.\nWe evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.  We utilize either a qualitative or quantitative approach to assess the likelihood of impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter.  When performing the qualitative approach, we consider macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units.  When performing the quantitative approach, we compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the reporting unit's fair value.  The estimation of a reporting unit's fair value involves using estimates and assumptions, including expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates.  If the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\n33\nIntangible assets acquired individually, with a group of other assets, or in a business combination are recorded at fair value.  Our intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, which ranges from three to ten years and has a weighted-average useful life of approximately seven years.  We write off fully amortized intangible assets when those assets are no longer used.\nWe review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows.  The estimated future cash flows are primarily based on assumptions about expected future operating performance.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOverview\nThe following table shows revenue by category, gross margin and gross margin as a percentage of revenue, operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue, diluted earnings per share, and annualized recurring revenue compared for the periods indicated:\n(1)\nRefer to “Supplemental Disclosure of Non-GAAP Financial Measures and Annualized Recurring Revenue” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for definitions.\nBasis of Presentation\nWe use a 52–53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest to December 31, which for 2021 was December 31, 2021.  Both 2021 and 2020 were 52–week years.\nYear 2021 Compared with Year 2020\nRevenue\nDespite supply constraints and increases in our backlog, revenue increased due to strong demand for our hardware and related software, as compared with reduced demand due to the impacts of COVID-19 lockdowns in the prior year, and strong recovery in 2021 in markets across major regions.  Growth in subscription sales in many of our software businesses continued to remain strong.  Price increases, which went into effect in the second half of the year, and reduced discounting had a slighter impact on revenue growth for the year.\nProduct revenue increased due to strong hardware and related software sales in Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Buildings and Infrastructure.  To a lesser extent, Transportation sales also contributed to growth.  Service revenue was relatively flat, and subscription revenue increased primarily due to strong growth in Buildings and Infrastructure, and to a lesser extent, Resources and Utilities and Geospatial, slightly offset by a decrease in Transportation.\n34\nDuring 2021, sales to customers in North America represente\nd 51%; Europe represented 31%; Asia Pacific represented 12%; and the rest of world represented 6% of our total revenue.\nNo single customer accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2021 and 2020.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nGross Margin\nGross margins varied due to several factors including product mix, customer pricing, distribution channel, and product costs.\nGross margin increased primarily due to\nstrong revenue growth.\nGross margin as a percentage of total revenue\nshows a slight decrease mainly due to increased mix of hardware sales and increased supply chain costs,\noffset by price increases and reduced discounting as well as lower intangibles amortization.\nOperating Income\nOperating income and operating income as a percentage of total revenue increased\nprimarily due to strong revenue growth in Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, and Resources and Utilities, partially offset by a decrease in Transportation, as well as relative operating expense containment in all segments.\nResearch and Development, Sales and Marketing, and General and Administrative Expenses\nThe following table shows research and development (“R&D”), sales and marketing (“S&M”), and general and administrative (“G&A”) expense along with these expenses as a percentage of revenue for the periods indicated:\nAs a result of COVID-19 impacts, the year-to-year comparison of 2020 to 2021 reflects distortions in expense growth rates as our expenses normalized  in 2021, with the biggest impact due to higher incentive compensation, including bonuses and stock-based compensation, particularly in G&A.\nR&D expense increased primarily due to higher compensation expense, including incentive compensation\n.\nWe believe that the development and introduction of new products are critical to our future success, and we expect to continue active development of new products.\nS&M expense increased primarily due to higher compensation expense, including incentive compensation and commissions.\nG&A expense increased primarily due to\nhigher compensation expense, including incentive compensation, and to a lesser extent, higher consulting and legal fees\n.\nAmortization of Purchased Intangible Assets\nThe following table shows amortization of purchased intangible assets for the periods indicated:\n35\nIn 2021, total amortization of purchased intangibles decreased primarily due to the expiration of prior year acquisitions' amortization.\nNon-Operating Income (Expense), Net\nThe following table shows non-operating expense, net for the periods indicated:\nIn 2021, non-operating income increased primarily due to recognition of gains from the sale of businesses included in Other income, net, and to a lesser extent,\nlower interest costs associated with a decrease in our outstanding debt.\nIncome Tax Provision\nIn December 2021, due to a change in the Netherlands tax law, the statutory tax rate was further increased from 25.0% to 25.8% effective January 1, 2022.\nAs a result, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $14.4 million in 2021 due to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nPreviously in December 2020, also as a result of a Netherlands tax law change that increased Netherlands statutory tax rate from 21.7% to 25.0%, effective January 1, 2021, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $64.0 million\nin 2020\ndue to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nOur effective income tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 14.2% and 1.1%, respectively.\nThe effective income tax rate in 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily due to the smaller one-time tax benefit  recorded in 2021 relating to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets mentioned above.\nResults by Segment\nWe report our financial performance, including revenue and operating income, based on four reportable segments:  Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Decision Maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system.  These results are not necessarily in conformance with U.S. GAAP.  For additional discussion of our segments, refer to Note 5 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n36\nThe following table shows a breakdown of revenue and operating income by segment for the periods indicated:\nThe following table shows a reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to our consolidated income before income taxes for the periods indicated:\nBuildings and Infrastructure\nRevenue increased primarily due to\nstrong demand for our civil construction hardware and related software and from strong recovery in markets across major regions, including strong residential construction and infrastructure spend.  Additionally, higher subscription revenue in our software businesses benefited from the continued cumulative effect of conversions from perpetual licenses to subscription offerings for existing and new customers, as well as improvements in our customer churn rate.\nSegment operating income and operating income as a percentage of revenue increased\nprimarily due to higher revenue,  consistent gross margin, and operating cost containment.  Increased supply chain costs for hardware products were wholly mitigated by reduced discounting and customer price increases.\n37\nGeospatial\nRevenue increased\nprimarily due to strong demand for geospatial survey products, with strong recovery in markets across major regions, including strong residential construction, infrastructure, and utilities spend.  Competitive products, including the R12i, helped win business.\nSegment operating income\nand operating income as a percentage of revenue\nincreased\nprimarily due to higher revenue and operating cost containment, partially offset by lower gross margin.  Gross margin was down primarily due to product mix and increased supply chain costs for hardware products, partially offset by reduced discounting and customer price increases.\nResources and Utilities\nRevenue increased\nprimarily due to continued agriculture business strength in the reseller and OEM channels in markets across major regions.  Strong market fundamentals, including favorable commodity prices, continued to fuel growth.\nSegment operating income increased\nprimarily due to higher revenue and operating expense containment. Gross margin was down due to product mix and higher supply chain costs for hardware products, partially offset by reduced discounting and customer price increases.  Operating income as a percentage of revenue was down due to lower gross margin.\nTransportation\nRevenue decreased slightly due to the impact of a divestiture, largely offset by continued growth in enterprise software sales.  Enterprise revenue continued to experience subscription revenue growth as the business transitions from a perpetual software license model.  Mobility sales were down due to reduced subscriber counts, partially offset by higher hardware shipments for the year.\nSegment operating income\nand operating income as a percentage of revenue\ndecreased slightly, primarily due to the revenue decline and a slight increase in operating expense.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily driven by higher net income adjusted for non-cash items, and higher account payables, partially offset by higher inventory purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nThe decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to higher net proceeds from the sale of businesses and sale of property and equipment during\n2021\n, partially offset by slightly higher acquisition spending in 2021.  The current year included the AgileAssets acquisition compared to the prior year, which included the Kuebix acquisition.\nFinancing Activities\nThe increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by an increase in repurchases of common stock, partially offset by a decrease in debt repayments, net of debt proceeds.\n38\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe believe that our cash and cash equivalents and borrowings, along with cash provided by operations will be sufficient in the foreseeable future to meet our anticipated operating cash needs, expenditures related to our Connect and Scale strategy, debt service, and any stock repurchases under the stock repurchase program.  For debt refinancing, we anticipate we will have readily accessible capital markets in order to secure appropriate funding.\nOur material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations and cash needs:\nLeases\nWe have operating leases primarily for certain of our major facilities including corporate offices, research and development facilities, and manufacturing facilities.  Operating leases represent undiscounted lease payments and include short-term leases.  At the end of 2021, we had fixed lease payment obligations of $190.7 million, with $50.5 million payable within the next 12 months.  Refer to Note 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our leases.\nTax Payable\nAt the end of 2021, we had income taxes payable of $101.6 million, with $47.1 million payable within the next 12 months.  The amount payable within the next 12 months includes $6.7 million representing a one-time transition tax liability as a result of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Tax Act”).\nIn addition, we have unrecognized tax benefits of $63.3 million included in Other non-current liabilities, including interest and penalties.  At this time, we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period of cash settlement with tax authorities regarding this liability, and therefore, such amounts are not included in the contractual obligations table above.  Refer to Note 11 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our taxes.\nOther Purchase Obligations and Commitments\nPurchase obligations and commitments primarily relate to investments in our platform associated with our Connect and Scale strategy and non-cancellable inventory commitments, which increased due to the extension of lead times and the growth of our hardware business.  At the end of 2021, we had operating purchase obligations and commitments of $710.8 million, with $446.6 million payable within the next 12 months.  Refer to Note 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our purchase obligations and commitments.\nOther than the items discussed above, we do not have any off-balance sheet financing arrangements or liabilities.\nDebt\nAt the end of 2021, we had outstanding floating and fixed-rate senior notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of approximately $1.3 billion.  Future interest payments total $264.2 million, with $60.8 million payable within the next 12 months.\nDuring 2021, we repaid $251.0 million of debt, including the full repayment of our term loan, net of borrowings.  Refer to Note 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our debt.\nStock Repurchase Program\nWe have a 2021 Stock Repurchase Program authorized by our Board of Directors, that allows us to repurchase shares from time to time, subject to business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market transactions, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, or by other means for up to $750 million.  The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares.  Refer to Note 13 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information regarding our 2021 Stock Repurchase Program.\nEFFECT OF NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nThe impact of recent accounting pronouncements is disclosed in Note 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n39\nS\nUPPLEMENTAL DISCLOSURE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES AND ANNUALIZED RECURRING REVENUE\nTo supplement our consolidated financial information, we included non-GAAP financial measures, which are not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for comparable GAAP because we believe non-GAAP financial measures provide useful information to investors and others in understanding our “core operating performance”, which excludes the effect of non-cash items and certain variable charges not expected to recur, not meaningful in comparison to our past operating performance or not reflective of ongoing financial results.  Lastly, we believe that our core operating performance offers a supplemental measure for period-to-period comparisons and can be used to evaluate our historical and prospective financial performance, as well as our performance relative to competitors.  In addition to providing non-GAAP financial measures, we disclose Annualized Recurring Revenue (“ARR”) to give the investors supplementary indicators of the value of our current recurring revenue contracts.\nARR represents the estimated annualized value of recurring revenue, including subscription, maintenance and support revenue, and term license contracts for the quarter.  ARR is calculated by adding the portion of the contract value of all of our term licenses attributable to the current quarter to our non-GAAP recurring revenue for the current quarter and dividing that sum by the number of days in the quarter and then multiplying that quotient by 365.  ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue as it is a performance measure and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items.\nThe non-GAAP financial measures, definitions, and explanations to the adjustments to comparable GAAP measures are included below:\n40\n41\nNon-GAAP Definitions\nNon-GAAP revenue\nWe define Non-GAAP revenue as GAAP revenue, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments.  We believe this measure helps investors understand the performance of our business including acquisitions, as non-GAAP revenue excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting.  Management believes that excluding fair value purchase accounting adjustments more closely correlates with the ordinary and ongoing course of the acquired company’s operations and facilitates analysis of revenue growth and trends.\nNon-GAAP gross margin\nWe define Non-GAAP gross margin as GAAP gross margin, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and restructuring and other costs.\nWe believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP gross margin as a way of understanding how product mix, pricing decisions, and manufacturing costs influence our business.\nNon-GAAP operating expenses\nWe define Non-GAAP operating expenses as GAAP operating expenses, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and restructuring and other costs.\nWe believe this measure is important to investors evaluating our non-GAAP spending in relation to revenue.\nNon-GAAP operating income\nWe define Non-GAAP operating income as GAAP operating income, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, deferred compensation, and restructuring, and other costs.\nWe believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP operating income trends, which are driven by revenue, gross margin, and spending.\nNon-GAAP non-operating expense, net\nWe define Non-GAAP non-operating expenses, net as GAAP non-operating expenses, net, excluding acquisition/divestiture items and deferred compensation.\nWe believe this measure helps investors evaluate our non-operating expense trends.\nNon-GAAP income tax provision\nWe define Non-GAAP income tax provision as GAAP income tax provision, excluding charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, tax law changes, and significant one-time reserve releases upon the statute of limitations expirations.  We believe this measure helps investors because it provides for consistent treatment of excluded items in our non-GAAP presentation and a difference in the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates.\nNon-GAAP net income\nWe define Non-GAAP net income as GAAP net income, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments.\nThis measure provides a supplemental view of net income trends, which are driven by non-GAAP income before taxes and our non-GAAP tax rate.\nNon-GAAP diluted net income per share\nWe defined Non-GAAP diluted net income per share as GAAP diluted net income per share, excluding the effects of purchase accounting adjustments, acquisition/divestiture items, stock-based compensation, restructuring and other costs, and non-GAAP tax adjustments.\nWe believe our investors benefit by understanding our non-GAAP operating performance as reflected in a per share calculation as a way of measuring non-GAAP operating performance by ownership in the company.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nWe define Adjusted EBITDA as non-GAAP operating income plus depreciation expense and income from equity method investments, net.\nOther companies may define Adjusted EBITDA differently.\nAdjusted EBITDA is not intended to purport to be an alternative to net income or operating income as a measure of operating performance or cash flow from operating activities as a measure of liquidity.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a performance measure that we believe offers a useful view of the overall operations of our business because it facilitates operating performance comparisons by removing potential differences\n42\ncaused by variations unrelated to operating performance, such as capital structures (interest expense), income taxes, depreciation and amortization expenses.\nExplanations of Non-GAAP adjustments\n(A)\nPurchase accounting adjustments\n.\nPurchase accounting adjustments consist of the following:\n(i)\nAcquired deferred revenue adjustment\n.  We adopted ASU 2021-08 in the fourth quarter of 2021 for all acquisitions occurring in 2021, which requires the application of ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities on the acquisition date.  For acquisitions occurring prior to 2021, non-GAAP revenue excludes the adjustment to our revenue as a result of measuring the contract liability at fair value on the acquisition date.\n(ii)\nAmortization of acquired capitalized commissions\n.  Purchase accounting generally requires entities to eliminate capitalized sales commissions balances as of the acquisition date.  Non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the adjustments that eliminate the capitalized sales commissions.  F\nor acquisitions occurring prior to 2021, non-GAAP operating expenses exclude the adjustment of ac\nquired capitalized commissions amortization.\n(iii)\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n.  Non-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude the amortization of purchased intangible assets, which primarily represents technology and/or customer relationships already developed.\n(B)\nAcquisition / divestiture items\n.\nNon-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude acquisition costs consisting of external and incremental costs resulting directly from merger and acquisition and strategic investment activities such as legal, due diligence, integration, and other closing costs, including the acceleration of acquisition stock options and adjustments to the fair value of earn-out liabilities.\nNon- GAAP non-operating expense, net, exclude unusual one-time acquisition/divestiture charges and/or divestiture gains/losses. The costs that have been excluded from the non-GAAP measures are costs specific to particular acquisitions. As a result, these are one-time costs that vary significantly in amount and timing and are not indicative of our core operating performance.\n(C)\nStock-based compensation / deferred compensation\n.\nNon-GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude stock-based compensation and income or expense associated with movement in our non-qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities.\nChanges in non-qualified deferred compensation plan assets, included in non-operating expense, net, offset the income or expense in the plan liabilities.\n(D)\nRestructuring and other costs.\nNon- GAAP gross margin and operating expenses exclude restructuring and other exit costs comprised of termination benefits related to reductions in employee headcount, including executive severance agreements, the closure or exit of facilities, and cancellation of certain contracts.\nIn addition, other costs include COVID-19 expenses incurred as a direct impact from the COVID-19 virus pandemic, such as cancellation fees of trade shows due to public safety issues, additional charges for disinfecting facilities, and personal protective equipment.\n(E)\nNon-GAAP items tax effected\n.\nThis amount adjusts the provision for income taxes to reflect the effect of the non-GAAP items (A) - (D) on non-GAAP net income.  This amount excludes the GAAP tax rate impact resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, which is separately disclosed in item (G).\n(F)\nDifference in GAAP and Non-GAAP tax rate\n.\nThis amount represents the difference between the GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates applied to the non-GAAP operating income plus the non-GAAP non-operating expense, net. The GAAP tax rate used for this calculation excludes the net deferred tax impacts resulting from the non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, which is separately disclosed in item (G).  The non-GAAP tax rate excludes charges and benefits such as net deferred tax impacts resulting from a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property and significant one-time reserve releases upon statute of limitations expirations.\n(G)\nIP restructuring and tax law change impacts.\nThese amounts represent net deferred tax impacts resulting from a non-U.S. intercompany transfer of intellectual property, consistent with tax law changes, including tax rates changes, and our international business operations.\n(H)\nGAAP and non-GAAP tax rate percentages\n.\nThese percentages are defined as GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of GAAP income before taxes and non-GAAP income tax provision as a percentage of non-GAAP income before taxes.\n43"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.  We use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks.  We do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  All financial instruments are used in accordance with policies approved by our board of directors.\nMarket Interest Rate Risk\nOur cash equivalents consisted primarily of interest and non-interest bearing bank deposits as well as bank time deposits.  The main objective of these instruments is safety of principal and liquidity while maximizing return, without significantly increasing risk.\nDue to the nature of our cash equivalents that they are readily convertible to cash, we do not anticipate any material effect on our portfolio due to fluctuations in interest rates.\nWe are exposed to market risk due to the possibility of changing interest rates under our credit facilities.  Our 2018 Credit Facility includes a five-year revolving loan facility with a maturity date of May 2023.  We also have four unsecured, uncommitted, revolving credit facilities that are callable by the bank at any time.  We may borrow funds under the 2018 Credit Facility in U.S. Dollars, Euros, or in certain other agreed currencies as described in Note 6 of this Annual Report on Form 10\n‑\nK.\nAt the end of 2021, we had one £55.0 million, two $75.0 million, and one €100.0 million revolving credit facilities, which are uncommitted.  At the end of 2021, we do not have any outstanding balance on our revolving credit facilities.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe operate in international markets, which expose us to market risk associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations between the U.S. Dollar and various foreign currencies, the most significant of which is the Euro.  In addition, volatile market conditions arising from the COVID-19 pandemic could result in changes in exchange rates.\nHistorically, the majority of our revenue contracts are denominated in U.S. Dollars, with the most significant exception being Europe, where we invoice primarily in Euro.  Additionally, a portion of our expenses, primarily the cost to manufacture, cost of personnel to deliver technical support on our products and professional services, sales and sales support, and research and development, are denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the Euro.\nRevenue resulting from selling in local currencies and costs incurred in local currencies are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, which can affect our operating income.  As exchange rates vary, operating income may differ from expectations.  In 2021, revenue and operating income were favorably impacted by foreign currency exchange rates by  $43.8 million and $4.3 million.\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on cash, debt, and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables, primarily denominated in Euro, New Zealand Dollars, Canadian Dollars, British Pound, and Brazilian Real.  These contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements, as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts.  These instruments are marked-to-market through earnings every period and generally range from one to two months in maturity.  We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.  We occasionally enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions.  Foreign currency forward contracts outstanding at the end of 2021 and 2020 are summarized as follows:\n44\nTRIMBLE INC.\nINDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n45"

    "text": "CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n46\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n47\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n48\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n49\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n50\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1:\nDESCRIPTION OF BUSINESS AND ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nTrimble Inc., (“we” or “our” or “us”) is incorporated in the State of Delaware since October 2016.\nWe are a leading provider of technology solutions that enable professionals and field mobile workers to improve or transform their work processes.  We focus on transforming the way the world works by delivering products and services that connect the physical and digital worlds.  We generate revenue primarily through the sale of our hardware, software, maintenance and support, professional services, and subscriptions.\nBasis of Presentation\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include our results of our consolidated subsidiaries.  Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.  Noncontrolling interests represent the noncontrolling stockholders’ proportionate share of the net assets and results of operations of our consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe use a 52–53 week fiscal year ending on the Friday nearest to December 31.  Fiscal 2021 and 2020 were both 52-week years ending on December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, respectively.  Fiscal 2019 was a 53-week year ended on January 3, 2020.  Unless otherwise stated, all dates refer to our fiscal year and fiscal periods.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes.  Estimates and assumptions are used for revenue recognition, including determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and determining standalone selling price (“SSP”) of performance obligations, provision for credit losses, sales returns reserve, inventory valuation, warranty costs, investments, acquired intangibles, goodwill and intangible asset impairment analysis, other long-lived asset impairment analysis, stock-based compensation, and income taxes.  We base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable\n.  Actual results that we experience may differ materially from our estimates.\nReportable Segments\nWe report our financial performance, including revenue and operating income, based on\nfour\nreportable segments: Buildings and Infrastructure, Geospatial, Resources and Utilities, and Transportation.\nOur Chief Executive Officer and Chief Operating Decision Maker views and evaluates operations based on the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system.  These results are not necessarily in conformance with U.S. GAAP.\nRevenue Recognition\nSignificant Judgments\nRevenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for those products or services.  Revenue is recognized net of allowance for returns and any taxes collected from customers.  We enter into contracts that may include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations; however, determining whether products or services are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for separately versus together may sometimes require significant judgment.\nJudgment is required to determine SSP for each distinct performance obligation.  We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when products and services are sold separately and determine whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the various products and services.  In instances where SSP is not directly observable, we determine SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs.\n51\nNature of Goods and Services\nWe generate revenue primarily from products, services, and subscriptions; each of which is a distinct performance obligation.  Descriptions are as follows:\nProduct\nProduct revenue includes hardware and software licenses.\nHardwar\ne is recognized when the control of the product transfers to the customer, which is generally when the product is shipped.  We recognize shipping fees reimbursed by customers as revenue and the cost for shipping as an expense in Cost of sales when control over products has transferred to the customer.\nSoftware\nincluding perpetual and term licenses is recognized upon delivery and commencement of license term.  In general, our contracts do not provide for customer specific acceptances.\nService\nService revenue includes hardware and software maintenance and support and professional services.\nHardware maintenance and support, commonly called extended warranty,\nentitles the customer to receive replacement parts and repair services.  Extended warranty is separately priced and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the extended service period, which begins after the standard warranty period, ranging from\none\nto\ntwo years\ndepending on the product line.\nSoftware maintenance and support\nentitles the customer to receive software product upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis and technical support.  Software maintenance is recognized on a straight-line basis commencing upon product delivery over the post-contract support term, which ranges from\none\nto\nthree years\n, with one year being most common.\nProfessional services\ninclude installation, training, configuration, project management, system integrations, customization, data migration/conversion, and other implementation services.  The majority of professional services are not complex, can be provided by other vendors, and are readily available and billed on a time-and-material basis. Revenue for distinct professional services is recognized over time, based on work performed.\nIn some contracts, products and professional services may be combined into a single performance obligation.  This generally arises when products or subscriptions are sold with significant customization, modification, or integration services.  Revenue for the combined performance\nis recognized over time as the work progresses because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer.\nSubscription\nSubscription revenue includes software as a service (“SaaS”), data, and hosting services.\nSaaS may be sold with devices used to collect, generate, and transmit data.  SaaS is distinct from the related devices.  In addition, we may host the software that the customer has separately licensed.  Hosting services are distinct from the underlying software.\nSubscription terms generally range from month-to-month to one to\nthree years\n.  Subscription revenue is recognized monthly over the subscription term, commencing from activation.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net, includes billed and unbilled amounts due from customers.  Unbilled receivables include revenue recognized that exceeds the amount billed to the customer, provided the billing is not contingent upon future performance, and we have the unconditional right to future payment with only the passage of time required.  Both billed and unbilled amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value.  The unbilled receivables were\n$\n39.5\nmillion\nand $\n138.7\nmillion at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nWe maintain an allowance for credit losses to provide for the estimated amount of receivables that will not be collected.  Each reporting period, we evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors such as age of the accounts receivable balances, credit quality, historical experience, and current\nand future\neconomic conditions that may affect a customer’s ability to pay.\nAt the end of 2021 and 2020, our allowance for credit losses was $\n7.0\nmillion.  The provision for credit losses for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n2.6\nmillion, $\n7.1\nmillion, and $\n6.5\nmillion.\n52\nDeferred Costs to Obtain Customer Contracts\nSales commissions incurred in obtaining contracts that include maintenance or subscription revenue are deferred if the contractual term is greater than a year or if renewals are expected, and the renewal commission is not commensurate with the initial commission.  These commission costs are deferred and amortized over the estimated benefit period, which is either the contract term or the shorter of customer life or product life that ranges from\nthree\nto\nseven years\n.  Contracts with an amortization period of a year or less from this deferral requirement are expensed as incurred.\nAt the end of 2021 and 2020, deferred costs to obtain customer contracts were $\n59.7\nmillion and $\n51.3\nmillion.  These costs are included in Other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.  There was no impairment loss in relation to the costs capitalized for the periods presented.\nAmortization expense related to deferred costs to obtain customer contracts was $\n25.9\nmillion, $\n22.8\nmillion, and $\n22.3\nmillion, for 2021, 2020, and 2019.  This expense is included in Sales and marketing expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value.  Adjustments are also made to reduce the cost of inventory for estimated excess or obsolete balances.  Factors influencing these adjustments include declines in demand that impact inventory purchasing forecasts, technological changes, product life cycle and development plans, component cost trends, product pricing, physical deterioration, and quality issues.  If our estimate used to reserve for excess and obsolete inventory differs from what is expected, we may be required to recognize additional reserves, which would negatively impact our gross margin.\nProperty and Equipment, Net\nProperty and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives or the lease terms when applicable.  Useful lives generally range from\nfour\nto\nsix years\nfor machinery and equipment,\nfive\nto\nten years\nfor furniture and fixtures,\ntwo\nto\nfive years\nfor computer equipment and software,\nthirty-nine years\nfor buildings, and the life of the lease for leasehold improvements.  We capitalize eligible costs to acquire or develop certain internal-use software and amortize those assets using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\ntwo\nto\nfive years\n.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception.  Operating leases with lease terms greater than one year are included in Operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, in both Other current liabilities, and Operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease.  Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term.  Present value is determined by using our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowings over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date.  The operating lease ROU asset includes adjustments made for uneven rents, lease incentives, and lease impairments.  Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLease agreements that include both lease and non-lease components are accounted for as part of the overall lease arrangement.\nBusiness Combinations\nWe account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting whereby certain identifiable assets and liabilities of the acquired business and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recorded at their estimated fair values as of the acquisition date.  Any purchase consideration in excess of the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.\nAcquisition-related expenses and related restructuring costs are expensed as incurred.\nWhen determining the fair values of certain assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and noncontrolling interests in the acquiree, we make significant estimates and assumptions, especially concerning intangible assets.  Critical estimates when valuing intangible assets include expected future cash flows based on consideration of future growth rates and margins, customer attrition rates, future changes in technology and brand awareness, loyalty and position, and discount rates.\n53\nGoodwill\nWe evaluate goodwill on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of potential impairment exist.  We utilize either a qualitative or quantitative approach to assess the likelihood of impairment as of the first day of the fourth quarter.  When performing the qualitative approach, we consider macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, overall financial performance, and other relevant events and factors that may impact the reporting units.  When performing the quantitative approach, we compare the reporting unit’s carrying amount, including goodwill, to the reporting unit's fair value.\nThe estimation of a reporting unit's fair value involves using\nestimates and assumptions including expected future operating performance using risk-adjusted discount rates.  Actual future results may differ from those estimates.  If the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets acquired individually, with a group of other assets, or in a business combination are recorded at fair value.  Our intangible assets are amortized over the period of estimated benefit using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from\nthree years\nto\nten years\nand have a weighted-average useful life of approximately\nseven years\n.  We write off fully amortized intangible assets when those assets are no longer used.\nWe review intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those assets may not be recoverable based on their future cash flows.  The estimated future cash flows are primarily based upon assumptions about expected future operating performance.\nWarranty\nWe accrue for warranty costs as part of our cost of sales based on associated material product costs, technical support labor costs, and costs incurred by third parties performing work on our behalf.  Our expected future cost is primarily estimated based upon historical trends in the volume of product returns within the warranty period and the cost to repair or replace the equipment.  When products sold include warranty provisions, they are covered by a warranty for periods ranging from\none year\nto\ntwo years\n.\nAccrued warranty expenses o\nf $\n17.1\nmillion\nand $\n13.8\nmillion are included in Other current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities recorded in foreign currency are translated to U.S. dollars at the exchange rate\ns\non the balance sheet date.  Revenue and expense are translated at average monthly exchange rates during the year.  Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the\nmeasurement\ndate fair value of the awards, net of expected forfeitures.  Expense is generally recognized on a\nstraight-line basis over\nthe requisite service period of the stock awards.  The estimate of the forfeiture rate is based on historical experience.\nAdvertising and Promotional Costs\nAdvertising and promotional costs are expensed as incurred.  Advertising and promotional expense was approximately\n$\n31.6\nmillion, $\n28.6\nmillion, and $\n42.7\nmillion, in 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred.  Development costs for software to be sold subsequent to reaching technical feasibility were not significant and were expensed as incurred.  We received third party funding of approximately\n$\n12.6\nmillion, $\n16.3\nmillion, and $\n16.5\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019.  We offset research and development expense with any unconditional third party funding earned and retain the rights to any technology developed under such arrangements.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method, whereby deferred tax assets or liability account balances are calculated at the balance sheet date using current tax laws and rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized.  Our valuation allowance is primarily attributable to foreign net operating losses and state research and development credit carryforwards.\n54\nRelative to uncertain tax positions, we only recognize a tax benefit if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position.  We consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments and may not accurately forecast actual tax audit outcomes.  Changes in recognition or measurement of our uncertain tax positions would result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.  Our practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and numerous other countries and are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions.  We generally believe that positions taken on our tax returns are more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, but tax authorities in some circumstance have, and may in the future, successfully challenge these positions.  Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges.  The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income, and cash flows.\nConcentrations of Risk\nCash and cash equivalents are maintained with several financial institutions.  Deposits held with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits.  Generally, these deposits may be redeemed upon demand and are maintained with financial institutions of reputable credit and therefore bear minimal credit risk.\nWe are also exposed to credit risk in our trade receivables, which are derived from sales to end-user customers in diversified industries as well as various resellers.  We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial conditions and limit the amount of credit extended, when deemed necessary, but generally do not require collateral.\nIn addition, we rely on a limited number of suppliers for a number of our critical components.\nGuarantees, Including Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others\nIn the normal course of business to facilitate sales of our products, we indemnify other parties, including customers, lessors, and parties to other transactions with us with respect to certain matters.  We may agree to hold the other party harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property infringement or other claims made against certain parties.  These agreements may limit the time within which an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim.  In connection with divesting some of our businesses or assets, we may also indemnify purchasers for certain matters in the normal course of business, such as breaches of representations, covenants, or excluded liabilities.  In addition, we entered into indemnification agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount under these indemnification agreements due to the limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement.  Historically, payments made under these agreements were not material, and\nno\nliabilities have been recorded for these obligations in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to minimize the short-term impact of foreign currency fluctuations on cash and certain trade and intercompany receivables and payables,\nprimarily denominated in New Zealand Dollars, Brazil Real, Canadian Dollars, Norwegian Krone, and Euro.  T\nhese contracts reduce the exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rate movements, as the gains and losses associated with foreign currency balances are generally offset with the gains and losses on the forward contracts.  These instruments are marked-to-market through earnings every\nreporting period and generally range from\none\nto\ntwo months\nin original maturity.  We occasionally enter into foreign currency forward co\nntracts to hedge the purchase price of some of our larger business acquisitions.  We do not enter into foreign currency forward contracts for trading purposes.  As of the years ended 2021 and 2020, there were\nno\nderivative financial instruments outstanding that were accounted for as hedges.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIncome Taxes—Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued amendments to the accounting for Income Taxes to reduce complexity by removing certain exceptions and implementing targeted simplifications.  We adopted the new standard on a prospective basis at the beginning of 2021.  The adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nBusiness Combinations—Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued amendments to improve, simplify, and provide consistency for recognition and measurement of acquired contract assets and contract liabilities from revenue contracts in a business combination.  The amendments require that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities under Topic 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n, as if it had originated the contracts.  The amendments also allow for election of certain practical expedients, which are applied on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis.  The new accounting amendments are effective for the Company beginning in 2023 with prospective application.  Early adoption is permitted, including in any interim period, and if elected, the amendments are applied retrospectively for any acquisitions that occurred in the year of interim adoption.\nWe early adopted the guidance in the fourth quarter of 2021 retrospectively to all business combinations completed since the beginning of 2021.\nThe adoption did not have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 2:\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nBasic earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.  Diluted earnings per share is computed based on the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period plus additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if potentially dilutive securities had been issued.  Potentially dilutive common shares include outstanding stock options, RSUs, contingently issuable shares, and shares to be purchased under our ESPP.\nThe following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nAnti-dilutive stock-based awards excluded from the calculations of diluted EPS were immaterial during the periods presented.\nNOTE 3:\nBUSINESS COMBINATION, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND GOODWILL\nOn December 13, 2021, we acquired\nAgileAssets\n, with total purchase consideration of\n$\n237.5\nmillion\n.  AgileAssets is a provider of SaaS solutions for transportation asset lifecycle management.  The financial results have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the acquisition.  The acquisition contributed less than\n1\n%\nof our total revenue during 2021.\nDuring 2020, we acquired\nthree\nbusinesses, with total purchase consideration of $\n205.1\nmillion.  The acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.  The largest acquisition was Kuebix,\na transportation\nmanagement system provider.  In the aggregate, the businesses acquired contributed less than\n1\n% of our total revenue during 2020.\nDuring 2019, we acquired\nfour\nbusinesses, with total purchase consideration of $\n247.0\nmillion.  The acquisitions were not significant individually or in the aggregate.  The largest acquisition was Cityworks, a company that provides enterprise asset management (EAM) software for utilities and local government.  In the aggregate, the businesses acquired contributed less than\n1\n% of our total revenue during 2019.\nFor the AgileAssets acquisition in 2021, the preliminary allocation of purchase price was based upon preliminary fair value estimates and analyses, including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, which could change within the measurement period as valuations are finalized.  The primary areas that remain preliminary relate to the fair values of intangible assets acquired and certain tangible assets and liabilities acquired.  We expect to finalize the valuation as soon as practicable, but no later than one year from the acquisition date.\nAcquisition costs of\n$\n13.6\nmillion\n,\n$\n20.3\nmillion, and $\n20.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, were expensed as incurred and are included in Cost of sales and General and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n56\nThe following table summarizes the business combinations completed during the periods indicated:\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table presents a summary of our intangible assets:\nAs of the end of 2021 and 2020, $\n160.1\nmillion and $\n338.3\nmillion of fully amortized intangible assets were written off.\nThe estimated future amortization expense of intangible assets at the end of 2021 was as follows:\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:\n57\nNOTE 4:\nCERTAIN BALANCE SHEET COMPONENTS\nThe components of inventory, net were as follows:\nFinished goods includes\n$\n13.7\nmillion and $\n11.7\nmillion at the end of 2021 and 2020 for costs of sales that have been deferred in connection with deferred revenue arrangements.\nThe components of property and equipment, net were as follows:\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of related tax were as follows:\nNOTE 5:\nREPORTING SEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nWe determined our operating segments based on how our Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) views and evaluates operations.  Various factors, including market separation and customer-specific applications, go-to-market channels, and products and services, were considered in determining these operating segments.  Our CODM regularly reviews our segment operating results to make decisions about resources to be allocated to each segment and assess performance.  In each of our segments, we sell many individual products.  For this reason, it is impracticable to segregate and identify revenue for each of the individual products or group of products we sell.\nOur reportable segments are described below:\n•\nBuildings and Infrastructure.\nThis segment primarily serves customers working in architecture, engineering, construction, and operations and maintenance.\n•\nGeospatial.\nThis segment primarily serves customers working in surveying, engineering, and government.\n•\nResources and Utilities.\nThis segment primarily serves customers working in agriculture, forestry, and utilities.\n•\nTransportation.\nThis segment primarily serves customers working in long haul trucking and freight shipper markets.\n58\nThe following Reporting Segment tables reflect the results of our reportable operating segments under our management reporting system.  These results are not necessarily in conformity with U.S. GAAP.  This is consistent with the way the CODM evaluates each of the segment's performance and allocates resources.\n59\nA reconciliation of our consolidated segment operating income to consolidated income before income taxes was as follows:\n(1)\nPurchase accounting adjustments include acquired deferred revenue adjustments, amortization of acquired capitalized commissions, and amortization of purchased intangible assets.\n60\nThe disaggregation of revenue by geography is summarized in the tables below.  Revenue is defined as revenue from external customers attributed to countries based on the location of the customer and excludes the effects of certain acquired deferred revenue that was written down to fair value in purchase accounting, consistent with the Reporting Segment tables above.\nTotal revenue in the United States as included in the Consolidated Statements of Income was\n$\n1,687.4\nmillion\n, $\n1,502.3\nmillion, and $\n1,641.0\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019.  No single customer or country other than the United States accounted for 10% or more of our total revenue in 2021, 2020, and 2019.  No single customer accounted for 10% or more of our accounts receivable at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nProperty and equipment, net by geographic area were as follows:\n61\nNOTE 6:\nDEBT\nDebt consisted of the following:\nEach of our debt agreements requires us to maintain compliance with certain debt covenants, all of which we complied with at the end of 2021.\nDebt Maturities\nAt the end of 2021, our debt maturities based on outstanding principal were as follows:\nSenior Notes\nAll series of senior notes in the above table bear interest that is payable semi-annually in June and December of each year.  For the 2023 and 2028 senior notes, the interest rate is subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s or S&P (or, if applicable, a substitute rating agency) downgrades (or subsequently upgrades) its rating assigned to the notes.\nSenior Notes are unsecured and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness.  We may redeem the notes of each series of senior notes at our option in whole or in part at any time.  Such indenture also contains covenants limiting our ability to create certain liens, enter into sale and lease-back transactions, and consolidate or merge with or into, or convey, transfer, or lease all or substantially all of our properties and assets, each subject to certain exceptions.\n2018 Credit Facility\nAt the end of 2021, we had access to a $\n1.25\nbillion unsecured revolving credit facility maturing in May 2023, which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including permitted acquisitions.  As part of the credit facility, we may request an additional term loan facility up to $\n500.0\nmillion prior to the maturity of the credit facility and subject to approval.\nUncommitted Facilities\nAt the end of 2021, we had\none\n£\n55.0\nmillion,\ntwo\n$\n75.0\nmillion, and\none\n€\n100.0\nmillion revolving credit facilities, which are uncommitted (the “Uncommitted Facilities”).  Generally, these uncommitted facilities may be redeemed upon demand.  Borrowings under uncommitted facilities are classified as short-term debt in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n62\nNOTE 7:\nLEASES\nWe have operating leases primarily for certain of our major facilities, including corporate offices, research and development facilities, and manufacturing facilities.  Lease terms range from\n1\nto\n13\nyears, and certain leases include options to extend the lease for up to\n9\nyears.  We consider options to extend the lease in determining the lease term.\nOperating lease expense consisted of:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n(1)\nExcludes cash payments for short-term leases, which are not capitalized.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nAt the end of 2021, the maturities of lease liabilities were as follows:\n63\nNOTE 8:\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nAt the end of 2021, we had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately $\n710.8\nmillion as compared to $\n241.1\nmillion at the end of 2020.  The increase was primarily related to investments in our platform associated with our Connect and Scale strategy and non-cancellable inventory commitments that increased due to extension of lead times and the growth of our hardware business.\nLitigation\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business.  There are no material legal proceedings, other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to the business, to which we or any of our subsidiaries is a party or of which any of our or our subsidiaries' property is subject.\nNOTE 9:\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of financial instruments at fair value on a recurring basis for the periods indicated and determined using the following inputs:\n(1)\nRepresents a self-directed, non-qualified deferred compensation plan for certain executives and other highly compensated employees included in Other non-current assets and Other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The plan is invested in actively traded mutual funds and individual stocks valued using observable quoted prices in active markets.\n(2)\nRepresents forward currency exchange contracts that are included in Other current assets and Other current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(3)\nRepresents arrangements to pay the former owners of certain companies that we acquired that are included in Other current liabilities on our Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets.  The fair values are estimated using scenario-based methods or option pricing methods based upon estimated future revenues, gross margins, or other milestones.  The undiscounted maximum payment under the arrangements is $\n14.8\nmillion at the end of 2021.\nAdditional Fair Value Information\nThe total estimated fair value of all outstanding financial instruments that are not recorded at fair value on a recurring basis (debt) was approximately $\n1.4\nbillion and $\n1.8\nbillion at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nThe fair value of the senior notes was determined based on observable market prices in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level II.  The fair values do not indicate the amount we would currently have to pay to extinguish any of this debt.\n64\nNOTE 10:\nDEFERRED REVENUE AND REMAINING PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS\nDeferred Revenue\nChanges in our deferred revenue during 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nAt the end of 2021, approximately $\n1.8\nbillion of revenue is expected to be recognized from remaining performance obligations for which goods or services have not been delivered, primarily subscription, post-contract services and hardware, and to a lesser extent, professional services.  We expect to recognize $\n1.4\nbillion or\n76\n% of our remaining performance obligations as revenue during the next\n12\nmonths and the remainder thereafter.\nNOTE 11:\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome before taxes and the provision (benefit) for taxes consisted of the following:\n65\nThe difference between the tax provision (benefit) at the statutory federal income tax rate and the tax provision (benefit) as a percentage of income before taxes (“effective tax rate”) was as follows:\nIn December 2021, due to a change in the Netherlands tax law, the statutory tax rate was further increased from\n25.0\n% to\n25.8\n% effective January 1, 2022.\nAs a result, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $\n14.4\nmillion in 2021 due to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.\nPreviously in December 2020, also as a result of a Netherlands tax law change that increased Netherlands statutory tax rate from\n21.7\n% to\n25.0\n%, effective January 1, 2021, we recorded a one-time tax benefit of $\n64.0\nmillion in 2020 due to the revaluation of the Netherlands deferred tax assets.\n66\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.\nThe significant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAt the end of 2021, we have U.S. federal and foreign net operating loss carryforwards, or NOLs, of approximately\n$\n12.9\nmillion\nand\n$\n90.2\nmillion\n, respectively.  The U.S. federal NOLs will begin to expire in 2026.  There is generally no expiration for the foreign NOLs.  Utilization of our U.S. federal NOLs is subject to annual limitations in accordance wit\nh the applicable tax code.  We have determined that it is more likely than not that we will not realize a portion of the foreign NOLs and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for such amount.\nWe have California research and development credit carryforwards of approximatel\ny\n$\n33.0\nmillion\n, which have an indefinite carryforward period.  We believe that it is more likely than not that we will not r\nealize a significant portion of the California research and development credit carryforwards and, accordingly, a valuation allowance has been established for such amount.\nAs a result of the Tax Act, we can repatriate foreign earnings back to the U.S. when needed with minimal U.S. income tax consequences.  We reinvested a large portion of our undistributed foreign earnings in acquisitions and other investments and inte\nnd to bring back a portion of foreign cash that was subject to the transition tax and the global intangible low-taxed income tax.  During 2021, we repatriated\n$\n290.1\nmillion\nof our foreign earnings to the U.S.\n67\nThe total amount of the unrecognized tax benefits at the end of 2021 was\n$\n64.2\nmillion\n.  A reconciliation of gross unrecognized tax benefit was as follows:\nTotal unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate were\n$\n42.3\nmillion and $\n47.8\nmillion at the end of 2021 and 2020.\nWe and our subsidiaries are subject to U.S. federal, state, and foreign income taxes.  Our tax years are substantially closed for all U.S. federal and state income taxes for audit purposes through 2015.  Non-U.S. income tax matters have been concluded for years through 2008.  We are currently in various stages of multiple year examinations state, and foreign (multiple jurisdictions) taxing authorities.  While we generally believe it is more likely than not that our tax positions will be sustained, it is reasonably possible that future obligations related to these matters could arise.  We believe that our reserves are adequate to cover any potential assessments that may result from the examinations and negotiations.\nAlthough timing of the resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, we do not believe that our gross unrecognized tax benefits would materially change in the next twelve months.\nOur practice is to recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in income tax expense.  Our liability for unrecognized tax benefits including interest and penalties was recorded in Other non-current liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  At the end of 2021 and 2020, we accrued $\n9.2\nmillion and $\n9.6\nmillion for interest and penalties.\nNOTE 12: EMPLOYEE STOCK BENEFIT PLANS\nAmended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan\nIn May 2020,\nour stockholders approved an amendment to the 2002 Stock Plan to increase the number of shares of common stock available for issuance by\n18.0\nmillion shares.  As such, our Amended and Restated 2002 Stock Plan provides for the granting of incentive and non-statutory stock options and RSUs for up to\n92.6\nmillion shares.  At the end of 2021, the remaining number of shares available for grant under the 2002 stock plan was\n20.2\nmillion\n.\nStock-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table summarizes the components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the periods indicated:\n68\nStock-based compensation expense was allocated as follows:\nAt the end of 2021, total unamortized stock-based compensation expense was $\n151.1\nmillion, with a weighted-average recognition period of\n2.0\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Units\nWe grant RSUs containing only service conditions and RSUs containing a combination of service, performance, and/or market conditions (“PSUs”).  RSUs containing only service conditions typically vest ratably over a\nthree\nto\nfour year\nservice period.  PSUs are granted to executive officers and other senior employees and vest after a\ntwo\nto\nthree year\nservice period.\nThe fair value at the grant date is determined by (1) the closing pr\nice of our common stock for awards containing only service or both service and performance conditions, or (2) the Monte Carlo valuation model for awards containing both service and  market conditions.\nFor PSUs, the number of shares received at vesting will range from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target grant amount based on either (1) market conditions, (2) performance conditions, or (3) both.  Market conditions consider our relative total stockholder return (“TSR”) of our common stock as compared to the TSR of the constituents of the S&P 500 over the vesting period.  Performance conditions consider the achievement of our financial results over the vesting period.\n(1)\nIncludes\n0.2\nmillion\nPSUs granted,\n0.4\nmillion PSUs vested, and\n1.1\nmillion\nPSUs outstanding at the end of the year.\n(2)\nExcludes approximately\n0.1\nmillion\nPSUs related to achievement above target levels at the vesting date.\nThe weighted-average grant date fair value of all RSUs granted during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n78.44\n, $\n42.50\n, and $\n41.38\nper share.  The fair value of all RSUs vested during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n81.4\nmillion, $\n78.0\nmillion, and $\n75.7\nmillion per share.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have an ESPP under which our stockholders have approved an aggregate of\n39.0\nmillion shares of common stock for issuance to eligible employees.  The fair value at the grant date is based on the Black-Scholes valuation model.  The plan permits eligible employees to purchase common stock through payroll deductions at\n85\n% of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning or at the end of each offering period, which is\nsix months\n.  Rights to purchase shares are granted during the first and third quarter of each year.  The ESPP terminates on March 15, 2027.  In 2021, 2020, and 2019,\n0.6\nmillion,\n0.8\nmillion, and\n0.8\nmillion shares were issued, representing $\n33.4\nmillion, $\n26.9\nmillion, and $\n25.7\nmillion in cash received for the issuance of stock under the ESPP.  At the end of 2021, the number of shares reserved for future purchases was\n6.0\nmillion.\n69\nNOTE 13:\nCOMMON STOCK REPURCHASE\nIn August 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase program (“2021 Stock Repurchase Program”) authorizing up to $\n750.0\nmillion in repurchases of our common stock.  Under the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, the share repurchase authorization does not have an expiration date and supersedes and replaces the $\n600.0\nmillion share repurchase authorization approved by our Board of Directors in November 2017 (“2017 Stock Repurchase Program”), of which $\n50.7\nmillion was remaining and has been cancelled.\nUnder the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program, we may repurchase shares from time to time, subject to business and market conditions and other investment opportunities, through open market transactions, privately-negotiated transactions, accelerated stock repurchase plans, or by other means.  The timing and actual number of any shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including market conditions, our share price, other available uses of capital, applicable legal requirements, and other factors.  The 2021 Stock Repurchase Program may be suspended, modified, or discontinued at any time at the Company’s discretion without notice.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, we repurchased approximately\n2.1\nmillion,\n1.9\nmillion, and\n4.7\nmillion shares of common stock in open market purchases under our 2017 and 2021 Stock Repurchase Programs, at an average price of $\n85.75\n, $\n43.40\n, and $\n38.51\nper share, for a total of $\n180.0\nmillion, $\n81.6\nmillion, and $\n179.8\nmillion.\nAt the end of 2021, the 2021 Stock Repurchase Program had remaining authorized funds of\n$\n610.0\nmillion\n.\nStock repurchases are reflected as a decrease to common stock based on par value and additional-paid-in-capital, based on the average book value per share for all outstanding shares calculated at the time of each individual repurchase transaction.  The excess of the purchase price over this average for each repurchase was charged to retained earnings.  As a result of the 2021 repurchases, retained earnings was reduced by\n$\n164.3\nmillion\nin 2021.  Common stock repurchases under the program were recorded based upon the trade date for accounting purposes.\n70\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Trimble Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Trimble Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\n71\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 22, 2022\n72\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Trimble Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Trimble Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Trimble Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management's assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of the current year acquisition, which is included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted less than 1% of tangible assets and net assets as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of revenues and net income for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of the current year acquisition.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and January 1, 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 22, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nSan Jose, California\nFebruary 22, 2022\n73"

    "text": "(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”), has evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”)) as of the end of the period covered by this report.  Based on such evaluation, our CEO and CFO have concluded that, as of the end of such period, our disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nInherent Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls\nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent or detect all error and all fraud.  A control system, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable, not absolute, assurance that the control system’s objectives will be met.  The design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events, and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions.\n(b) Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).  Our internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nOur management, including the CEO and CFO, conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework).  We have excluded from our evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting the current year acquisition, which is included in the December 31, 2021 consolidated financial statements and constituted less than 1% of tangible assets and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and less than 1% of revenue and net income, respectively, for the year then ended.  Based on the results of this evaluation, our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective at the end of 2021.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at the end of 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included elsewhere herein.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
