    "text": "United Rentals is the largest equipment rental company in the world, operates throughout the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The table below presents key information about our business as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. Our business is discussed in more detail below. The data below should be read in conjunction with, and is qualified by reference to, our Management’s Discussion and Analysis and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contained elsewhere in this report.\n1\n(1)\nReflects the estimated impact of inflation on the revenue productivity of fleet based on OEC, which is recorded at cost.\n(2)\nReflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of\n2\nequipment rentals revenue. Rental rate changes are calculated based on the year-over-year variance in average contract rates, weighted by the prior period revenue mix. Time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year. Mix includes the impact of changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix. The positive fleet productivity for 2021 and the negative fleet productivity for 2020 include the impact of the novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions, as discussed further below. The COVID-19 volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021, and in 2021, we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets. The 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue also includes the impact of COVID-19 (see \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" below for further discussion).\n(3)\nReflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue (see note 3 for further detail), excluding owned equipment rental revenue.\n(4)\nAs discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance Corporation (“General Finance”), which was a leading provider of mobile storage equipment and modular office space. Prior to the General Finance acquisition, we did not rent material amounts of such equipment.\n(5)\nAs discussed below (see \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\"), North American equipment rental industry revenue is based on industry estimates from the American Rental Association (\"ARA\"). Subsequent to our prior disclosure of 2020 industry information, the ARA decreased its estimate of the size of the North American equipment rental industry. As a result of this change, relative to our prior disclosures, our market share for 2020 increased and the size of the 2020 decline in North American equipment rental industry revenue decreased.\nCOVID-19\nCOVID-19 was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" below for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which is explained in more detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and which we believe helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results.\nWe began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, when rental volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021, and we have seen recent evidence of recovery across our construction and industrial markets, as well as encouraging gains in end-market indicators, as reflected in our 2022 forecast. COVID-19 is discussed in more detail throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nHuman Capital\nThe Company’s key human capital management objectives are to attract, retain and develop talent to deliver on the Company’s strategy. To support these objectives, the Company’s human resources programs are designed to: keep people safe and healthy; enhance the Company’s culture through efforts aimed at making the workplace more inclusive; acquire and retain diverse talent; reward and support employees through competitive pay and benefit programs; develop talent to prepare them for critical roles and leadership positions; and facilitate internal talent mobility to create a high-performing workforce. See “Locations/Personnel” in the table above for information on employee counts.\nThe Company focuses on the following in managing its human capital:\n•\nHealth and safety:\nWe have a safety program that focuses on implementing management systems, policies and training programs and performing assessments to see that workers are trained properly and that injuries and incidents are prevented. All of our employees are empowered with stop-work authority which enables them to immediately stop any unsafe or potentially hazardous working condition or behavior they may observe. We utilize a mixture of indicators to assess the safety performance of our operations, including total recordable injury rate, preventable motor vehicle incidents per million miles, corrective actions and near miss frequency. We also recognize outstanding safety behaviors through our annual awards program.\n•\nEmployee wellness:\nThe Company’s Live Well, Safe & Healthy program is a comprehensive approach to wellness that encourages healthy behaviors and is intended to raise morale, productivity and overall employee engagement. The program includes a biometric screening at work or off-site, a health assessment, a paid day off to be used for a\n3\nwellness exam or day of service, tobacco cessation support, and participation incentives. Additionally, employees and family members can participate in virtual health challenges to encourage daily activity. Approximately 50 percent of eligible employees participated in the program in 2021.\n•\nDiversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”):\nWe believe that an inclusive and diverse team is key to the success of our culture and aim to drive DE&I initiatives through many efforts, including sponsoring four employee-led employee resource groups (“ERGs”) that represent and support the diverse communities that make up our workforce. The ERGs facilitate networking and connecting with peers, outreach and mentoring, and leadership and skill development. The Company has internal goals for overall workforce diversity and additional goals for specific positions at the Company, and there has been positive progress in diverse representation at the Company, as reflected in a four percentage point increase in diverse employees in sales and management roles, which increased from 27 percent in 2018 to 31 percent in 2021. In addition, the Company has made hiring and supporting veterans a priority through its veterans ERG and working with organizations that support the veteran community. Importantly, in 2021, we conducted a Company-wide culture workshop with all employees designed to continue our dialogue on racial justice and social equity by focusing on three important keys of our culture: safety and wellness, DE&I, and trust and communication.\n•\nCompensation programs and employee benefits:\nOur compensation and benefits programs provide a package designed to attract, retain and motivate employees. In addition to competitive base salaries, the Company provides a variety of short-term, long-term and commission-based incentive compensation programs to reward performance relative to key financial, human capital and customer experience metrics. We offer comprehensive benefit options including paid time off, retirement savings plans, medical and prescription drug benefits, dental and vision benefits, accident and critical illness insurance, life and disability insurance, health savings accounts, flexible spending accounts, legal coverage, auto/home insurance, identity theft insurance and tuition assistance. Additionally, we have conducted three company-wide stock grant programs for employees since 2014 – the most recent grant was in recognition of our employees’ special efforts during the COVID-19 pandemic, and initially took place in 2020, with an update in 2021 recognizing the contributions of newly hired employees since the 2020 grant date.\n•\nEmployee experience and retention:\nTo evaluate our employee experience and retention efforts, we monitor a number of employee measures, such as employee retention, internal promotions and referrals. For example, total employee turnover, which represents voluntary and involuntary terminations during the year divided by average headcount during the year, was 15.4 percent, 11.9 percent and 14.4 percent for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We also conduct an annual employee experience survey, which provides valuable information on drivers of engagement and areas where we can improve. Our 2021 employee experience survey showed year-over-year increases in most categories and no declines in any category. Additionally, when we asked employees how likely they are to continue with the Company beyond 6 months, the average response was 9.2 out of 10, which was consistent with the average response in 2020. We believe this question assesses our employees’ commitment to United Rentals, and that the response is consistent with our strong employee retention. To provide an open and frequent line of communication for all employees, we host town hall meetings and quarterly all employee conference calls, and utilize Workplace to engage with our full team. The Company also sponsors the United Compassion Fund, an employee-funded 501(c)(3) charity that provides financial assistance to fellow employees in need. In 2021, employees voluntarily donated approximately $1.3 million to the fund, and employees received 403 grants totaling approximately $875,000.\n•\nTraining and development:\nThe Company is committed to the continual development of its employees. We aim for all new hires to attend JumpSTART, a new hire orientation, to quickly acclimate them to our culture, as well as applicable new hires to attend Center of Excellence (job related) training within 90 days of hire. We offer a wide array of training solutions (classroom, hands-on, e-learning and experience maps) for further development of our employees to help them achieve their career goals. In addition, as we did in 2021, we aim to regularly develop new training programs, launch pilot programs and expand leadership opportunities for our employees. In 2021, our employees enhanced their skills through approximately 460,000 hours of training, including safety training, sales and leadership training and equipment-related training from our suppliers. The majority of our training was delivered virtually during 2021 and 2020. Our performance process encourages employee check-ins throughout the year to discuss performance and career goals, as well as development opportunities at all levels across the Company.\nStrategy\nFor the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency.\n4\nWe are continuing to manage the impact of COVID-19, as discussed throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” Our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital, and, in particular, calls for:\n•\nA consistently superior standard of service to customers\n, often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the cross-selling of the various services we offer throughout our network. We utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control\n®\n, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. Total Control\n®\nis a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers. Our digital capabilities, including our Total Control\n®\nplatform, allow our sales teams to provide contactless end-to-end customer service;\n•\nThe further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix,\nwith a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. We believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select local contractors. Our fleet team's analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns;\n•\nA continued focus on “Lean” management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement\n. We continue to implement Lean kaizen processes across our branch network, with the objectives of: reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers; improving invoice accuracy and service quality; reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations;\n•\nThe continued expansion of our specialty footprint, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, and the cross-selling of these services throughout our network\n. We believe that the expansion of our specialty business, as exhibited by our acquisition of General Finance discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, will further position United Rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings; and\n•\nThe pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business\n. Strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business, further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals.\nIndustry Overview and Economic Outlook\nUnited Rentals serves the following three principal end-markets for equipment rental in North America: industrial and other non-construction; commercial (or private non-residential) construction; and residential construction, which includes remodeling. In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of BakerCorp International Holdings, Inc. (“BakerCorp”), which allowed for our entry into select European markets. As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance, which allowed for our entry into select markets in Australia and New Zealand. See Item 2—Properties for further geographical detail on our rental network. In 2021, based on an analysis of our charge account customers’ Standard Industrial Classification (“SIC”) codes:\n•\nIndustrial and other non-construction rentals represented approximately 50 percent of our rental revenue, primarily reflecting rentals to manufacturers, energy companies, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, shipbuilders, utilities, retailers and infrastructure entities;\n•\nCommercial construction rentals represented approximately 46 percent of our rental revenue, primarily reflecting rentals related to the construction and remodeling of facilities for office space, lodging, healthcare, entertainment and other commercial purposes; and\n•\nResidential rentals represented approximately four percent of our rental revenue, primarily reflecting rentals of equipment for the construction and renovation of homes.\nWe estimate that, based on industry estimates from the ARA, 2021 North American equipment rental industry revenue grew approximately 4 percent year-over-year. In 2021, our full year rental revenue increased by 14.9 percent year-over-year, which included the impact of the General Finance acquisition that was completed in May 2021 and is discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. As discussed in more detail throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, the increase in rental revenue includes the significant impact in 2020 of COVID-19, which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. Our estimated North American market share of approximately 15 percent in 2021 increased from 14 percent in 2020.\nIn 2022, based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators, we expect a continuation of the market recovery experienced in 2021, following a market decline in 2020, which included the pronounced impact of\n5\nCOVID-19. Specifically, we expect that North American industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 10 percent in 2022.\nCompetitive Advantages\nWe believe that we benefit from the following competitive advantages:\nLarge and Diverse Rental Fleet\n. Our large and diverse fleet allows us to serve large customers that require substantial quantities and/or wide varieties of equipment. We believe our ability to serve such customers should allow us to improve our performance and enhance our market leadership position.\nWe manage our rental fleet, which is the largest and most comprehensive in the industry, utilizing a life-cycle approach that focuses on satisfying customer demand and optimizing utilization levels. As part of this life-cycle approach, we closely monitor repair and maintenance expense and can anticipate, based on our extensive experience with a large and diverse fleet, the optimum time to dispose of an asset.\nSignificant Purchasing Power\n. We purchase large amounts of equipment, contractor supplies and other items, which enables us to negotiate favorable pricing, warranty and other terms with our vendors.\nNational Account Program\n. Our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large companies, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. National accounts are generally defined as customers with potential annual equipment rental spend of at least $500,000 or customers doing business in multiple states. We offer our national account customers the benefits of a consistent level of service across North America, a wide selection of equipment and a single point of contact for all their equipment needs. National accounts are a subset of key accounts, which are our accounts that are managed by a single point of contact. Establishing a single point of contact for our key accounts helps us provide customer service management that is more consistent and satisfactory.\nOperating Efficiencies\n. We benefit from the following operating efficiencies:\n•\nEquipment Sharing Among Branches\n. Each branch within a region can access equipment located elsewhere in the region. This fleet sharing increases equipment utilization because equipment that is idle at one branch can be marketed and rented through other branches. Additionally, fleet sharing allows us to be more disciplined with our capital spend.\n•\nCustomer Care Center\n. We have a Customer Care Center (\"CCC\") in Charlotte, North Carolina that handles all telephone calls to our customer service telephone line, 1-800-UR-RENTS. The CCC handles many of the 1-800-UR-RENTS telephone calls without having to route them to individual branches, and allows us to provide a more uniform quality experience to customers, manage fleet sharing more effectively and free up branch employee time.\n•\nConsolidation of Common Functions\n. We reduce costs through the consolidation of functions that are common to our branches, such as accounts payable, payroll, benefits and risk management, information technology and credit and collection.\nOur\ninformation technology systems\n, some of which are proprietary and some of which are licensed, support our operations. Our information technology infrastructure facilitates our ability to make rapid and informed decisions, respond quickly to changing market conditions and share rental equipment among branches. We have an in-house team of information technology specialists that supports our systems.\nOur information technology systems are accessible to management, branch and call center personnel. Leveraging information technology to achieve greater efficiencies and improve customer service is a critical element of our strategy. Each branch is equipped with one or more workstations that are electronically linked to our other locations and to our data center. Rental transactions can be entered at these workstations, or through various mobile applications, to be processed on a real-time basis.\nOur information technology systems:\n•    enable branch personnel to (i) determine equipment availability, (ii) access all equipment within a geographic region and arrange for equipment to be delivered from anywhere in the region directly to the customer, (iii) monitor business activity on a real-time basis and (iv) obtain customized reports on a wide range of operating and financial data, including equipment utilization, rental rate trends, maintenance histories and customer transaction histories;\n•    allow our mobile sales and service team members to support our customers efficiently while in the field;\n•    permit customers to access their accounts online; and\n•    allow management to obtain a wide range of operational and financial data.\n6\nWe have a fully functional back-up facility designed to enable business continuity for our core rental and financial systems in the event that our main computer facility becomes inoperative. This back-up facility also allows us to perform system upgrades and maintenance without interfering with the normal ongoing operation of our information technology systems.\nStrong Brand Recognition\n. As the largest equipment rental company in the world, we have strong brand recognition, which helps us attract new customers and build customer loyalty.\nGeographic and Customer Diversity\n. We primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and our global branch network includes 1,345 rental locations. See Item 2—Properties for further geographical detail on our branch network. Our North American network operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province, and serves customers that range from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. We believe that our geographic and customer diversity provides us with many advantages including:\n•\nenabling us to better serve national account customers with multiple locations;\n•\nhelping us achieve favorable resale prices by allowing us to access used equipment resale markets across North America; and\n•\nreducing our dependence on any particular customer.\nOur foreign operations are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on fluctuations in exchange rates and (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. For additional financial information regarding our geographic diversity, see note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nStrong and Motivated Branch Management\n. Each of our full-service branches has a manager who is supervised by a district manager. We believe that our managers are among the most knowledgeable and experienced in the industry, and we empower them, within budgetary guidelines, to make day-to-day decisions concerning branch matters. Each regional office has a management team that monitors branch, district and regional performance with extensive systems and controls, including performance benchmarks and detailed monthly operating reviews.\nRisk Management and Safety Programs\n. Our risk management department is staffed by experienced professionals directing the procurement of insurance, managing claims made against the Company, and developing loss prevention programs to address workplace safety, driver safety and customer safety. The department’s primary focus is on the protection of our employees and assets, as well as protecting the Company from liability for accidental loss.\nSegment Information\nWe have two reportable segments– general rentals and specialty (formerly \"trench, power and fluid solutions\"). Segment financial information is presented in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements.\nThe general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial and industrial equipment, general tools and light equipment, and related services and activities. The general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities and homeowners. The general rentals segment is comprised of four geographic divisions—Central, Northeast, Southeast and West—and operates throughout the United States and Canada.\nThe specialty segment includes the rental of specialty construction products such as (i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, (ii) power and HVAC equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment, (iii) fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment, transfer and treatment, and (iv) mobile storage equipment and modular office space. The specialty segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment primarily operates in the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\nProducts and Services\nOur principal products and services are described below.\nEquipment Rental\n. We offer for rent approximately 4,300 classes of rental equipment on an hourly, daily, weekly or monthly basis. The types of equipment that we offer include general construction and industrial equipment; aerial work platforms; trench safety equipment; power and HVAC equipment; fluid solutions equipment; mobile storage equipment and modular office space; and general tools and light equipment.\n7\nSales of Rental Equipment\n.\nWe routinely sell used rental equipment and invest in new equipment in order to manage repair and maintenance costs, as well as the composition and size of our fleet. We also sell used equipment in response to customer demand for the equipment. Consistent with the life-cycle approach we use to manage our fleet, the rate at which we replace used equipment with new equipment depends on a number of factors, including changing general economic conditions, growth opportunities, the market for used equipment, the age of our fleet and the need to adjust fleet composition to meet customer demand.\nWe utilize many channels to sell used equipment: through our national and export sales forces, which can access many resale markets across our network; at auction; through brokers; and directly to manufacturers. We also sell used equipment through our website, which includes an online database of used equipment available for sale.\nSales of New Equipment\n. We sell equipment such as aerial lifts, reach forklifts, telehandlers, compressors and generators from many leading equipment manufacturers. The type of new equipment that we sell varies by location.\nContractor Supplies Sales\n. We sell a variety of contractor supplies including construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies.\nService and Other Revenues\n. We offer repair and maintenance services and sell parts for equipment that is owned by our customers.\nCustomers\nOur customer base is highly diversified and ranges from Fortune 500 companies to small businesses and homeowners. Our customer base varies by branch and is determined by several factors, including the equipment mix and marketing focus of the particular branch as well as the business composition of the local economy, including construction opportunities with different customers. Our customers include:\n•\nconstruction companies that use equipment for constructing and renovating commercial buildings, warehouses, industrial and manufacturing plants, office parks, airports, residential developments and other facilities;\n•\nindustrial companies—such as manufacturers, chemical companies, paper mills, railroads, ship builders and utilities—that use equipment for plant maintenance, upgrades, expansion and construction;\n•\nmunicipalities that require equipment for a variety of purposes; and\n•\nhomeowners and other individuals that use equipment for projects that range from simple repairs to major renovations.\nOur business is seasonal, with demand for our rental equipment tending to be lower in the winter months.\nSales and Marketing\nWe market our products and services through multiple channels as described below.\nSales Force\n. Our sales representatives work in our branches and at our customer care center, and are responsible for calling on existing and potential customers as well as assisting our customers in planning for their equipment needs. We have ongoing programs for training our employees in sales and service skills and on strategies for maximizing the value of each transaction.\nNational Account Program\n. Our national account sales force is dedicated to establishing and expanding relationships with large customers, particularly those with a national or multi-regional presence. Our national account team closely coordinates its efforts with the local sales force in each area.\nOnline Rental Platform (UROne\n®\n)\n. Our customers can check equipment availability and pricing, and reserve equipment online, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, by accessing our equipment catalog and used equipment listing, which can be found at\nwww.unitedrentals.com.\nOur customers can also use our UR Control\n®\napplication to actively manage their rental process and access real-time reports on their business activity with us.\nTotal Control\n®\n. We utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control\n®\n, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. This software can be integrated into the customers' enterprise resource planning system. Total Control\n®\nis a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers.\n8\nAdvertising\n. We promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including television, trade publications, yellow pages, the internet, radio and direct mail. We also regularly participate in industry trade shows and conferences and sponsor a variety of local and national promotional events.\nSuppliers\nOur strategic approach with respect to our suppliers is to maintain the minimum number of suppliers per category of equipment that can satisfy our anticipated volume and business requirements. This approach is designed to ensure that the terms we negotiate are competitive and that there is sufficient product available to meet anticipated customer demand. We utilize a comprehensive selection process to determine our equipment vendors. We consider product capabilities and industry position, the terms being offered, product liability history, customer acceptance and financial strength. We believe we have sufficient alternative sources of supply available for each of our major equipment categories. For a discussion of the risks associated with potential supply chain disruptions, see Item 1A- Risk Factors (“Operational Risks-\nDisruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance\n\").\nCompetition\nWe primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The North American equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. As the largest equipment rental company in the industry, we estimate that we have an approximate 15 percent market share in North America based on 2021 total equipment rental industry revenues as measured by the ARA. Estimated market share is calculated by dividing our total 2021 North American rental revenue by ARA’s forecasted 2021 industry revenue. Our competitors primarily include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations; regional competitors that operate in one or more states; public companies or divisions of public companies that operate nationally or internationally; and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We believe we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more resources and certain competitive advantages over our smaller competitors. These advantages include greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, and greater flexibility to transfer equipment among locations in response to, and in anticipation of, customer demand. The fragmented nature of the industry and our relatively small market share, however, may adversely impact our ability to mitigate rental rate pressure. See \"Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" above for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020, which included the pronounced impact of COVID-19, as well as projected performance in 2022.\nEnvironmental and Safety Regulations\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate issues such as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous wastes and materials, and air quality. Our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, but we use and store hazardous materials as part of maintaining our rental equipment fleet and the overall operations of our business, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from storage tanks at certain locations. Under environmental and safety laws, we may be liable for, among other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous wastes for disposal or treatment, regardless of fault, and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. We incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate investigation and remediation activities at certain locations.\nEmployees\nApproximately 6,200 of our employees are salaried and approximately 14,200 are hourly. Collective bargaining agreements relating to approximately 133 separate locations cover approximately 1,450 of our employees. We monitor employee satisfaction through ongoing surveys and consider our relationship with our employees to be good.\nAvailable Information\nWe make our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to these reports, as well as our other SEC filings, available on our website, free of charge, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC. Our website address is\nwww.unitedrentals.com\n. The information contained on our website is not incorporated by reference in this document."

    "text": "Our business, results of operations and financial condition are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as\n9\nthe other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations. Should any of these risks materialize, our business, results of operations, financial condition and future prospects could be negatively impacted, which in turn could affect the trading value of our securities.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nOur business is cyclical in nature. Economic slowdowns and decreases in general economic activity have in the past caused weakness in our end-markets and had adverse effects on our revenues and operating results, and could do so again in the future.\nOur general rental equipment and specialty equipment are used in connection with private non-residential construction and industrial activities, which are cyclical in nature. In the past, weakness in our end-markets has led to a decrease in the demand for our equipment and in the rates we realized. Such decreases adversely affected our operating results by causing our revenues to decline and, because certain of our costs are fixed, our operating margins to be reduced. A worsening of economic conditions, in particular with respect to North American construction and industrial activities, could cause weakness in our end-markets and adversely affect our revenues and operating results.\nThe following factors, among others, may cause weakness in our end-markets, either temporarily or long-term:\n•\na decrease in expected levels of infrastructure spending;\n•\na lack of availability of credit;\n•\nexcess fleet in the equipment rental industry;\n•\na decrease in the level of exploration, development, production activity and capital spending by oil and natural gas companies;\n•\nan increase in the cost of construction materials;\n•\nan increase in interest rates;\n•\nadverse weather conditions, which may temporarily affect a particular region;\n•\na prolonged shutdown of the U.S. government;\n•\npublic health crises and epidemics, such as COVID-19;\n•\nsupply chain disruptions; or\n•\nterrorism or hostilities involving the United States, Canada, Europe, Australia or New Zealand.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its impact on business and economic conditions have adversely affected, and may in the future again adversely affect, our results of operations and financial position. Those adverse effects could be material.\nThe scale and scope of the COVID-19 pandemic, the uncertainty around the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and the impact that the COVID-19 pandemic and the various measures that have been implemented to protect public health have had on the economy and financial markets have adversely affected, and may in the future again adversely affect, our results of operations and financial position. In particular, the COVID-19 pandemic:\n•\nimpacted customer demand for equipment rentals;\n•\nreduced the availability and productivity of our employees;\n•\ncaused us to experience an increase in costs as a result of, among other factors, our emergency and business continuity measures, supply chain disruptions, cost inflation, delayed payments from our customers and uncollectible accounts; and\n•\nimpacted previously announced strategic plans, including our share repurchase program.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic could cause any of the impacts described above to recur or could cause other unpredictable events, including events that could impact our ability to access funds from financial institutions and capital markets on terms favorable to us, or at all, and there can be no assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not materially impact our results of operations and financial position in the future. Further, even though certain vaccines have been widely distributed and accepted in some geographies, there can be no assurance that the vaccines will ultimately be successful in limiting or stopping the spread of COVID-19, either over the long-term or against new, emerging variants of COVID-19. Even after the COVID-19 pandemic subsides, the U.S. economy and other major global economies may experience a recession, and we anticipate our business and operations could be materially adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the U.S. and other major markets. Therefore, it remains difficult to predict the ultimate impact of the pandemic on our results of operations and financial position. In addition,\n10\nto the extent that COVID-19 adversely affects our results of operations or financial position, it may also heighten the other risks described in this Item 1A-Risk Factors.\nTrends in oil and natural gas prices could adversely affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products.\nDemand for our services and products is sensitive to the level of exploration, development and production activity of, and the corresponding capital spending by, oil and natural gas companies, including national oil companies, regional exploration and production providers, and related service providers. The level of exploration, development and production activity is directly affected by trends in oil and natural gas prices, which historically have been volatile and are likely to continue to be volatile.\nPrices for oil and natural gas are subject to large fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas, market uncertainty, and a variety of other economic factors that are beyond our control. Any prolonged reduction in oil and natural gas prices will depress the immediate levels of exploration, development and production activity, which could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Even the perception of longer-term lower oil and natural gas prices by oil and natural gas companies and related service providers can similarly reduce or defer major expenditures by these companies and service providers given the long-term nature of many large-scale development projects. Additionally, potential climate change regulation, including a potential carbon tax, could adversely affect the level of exploration, development and production activity of certain of our customers and the demand for our services and products. See “Operational Risks–\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets\n.”\nOur industry is highly competitive, and competitive pressures could lead to a decrease in our market share or in the prices that we can charge.\nThe equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and competitive. Our competitors include small, independent businesses with one or two rental locations, regional competitors that operate in one or more states, national and global companies or divisions of national and global companies, and equipment vendors and dealers who both sell and rent equipment directly to customers. We may in the future encounter increased competition from our existing competitors or from new competitors. Competitive pressures could adversely affect our revenues and operating results by, among other things, decreasing our rental volumes, depressing the prices that we can charge or increasing our costs to retain employees.\nIncreases in fuel costs or reduced supplies of fuel could harm our business.\nWe believe that one of our competitive advantages is the mobility of our fleet. Accordingly, our business in the past has been, and in the future could be, adversely affected by limitations on fuel supplies or significant increases in fuel prices that result in higher costs to us for transporting equipment from one branch to another branch. Although we have used, and may continue to use, futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in fuel prices, a significant or protracted price fluctuation or disruption of fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations. Additionally, potential climate change regulation, including a potential carbon tax, could increase the overall cost of fuel to us and have a material adverse effect on us. See “Operational Risks–\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets\n.”\nRisks Related to our Indebtedness and Liquidity\nOur significant indebtedness exposes us to various risks.\nAt December 31, 2021, our total indebtedness was $9.7 billion. Our significant indebtedness could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition in a number of ways by, among other things:\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, adverse economic, industry or competitive developments, including adverse economic impacts from COVID-19;\n•\nmaking it more difficult to pay or refinance our debts as they become due during periods of adverse economic, financial market or industry conditions;\n•\nrequiring us to devote a substantial portion of our cash flow to debt service, reducing the funds available for other purposes, including funding working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions, execution of our growth strategy and other general corporate purposes, or otherwise constraining our financial flexibility;\n•\nrestricting our ability to move operating cash flows to Holdings. URNA’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL facility”), our senior secured term loan credit facility (“term loan facility”) and the indentures governing URNA’s outstanding indebtedness;\n11\n•\naffecting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital, acquisitions or other purposes, particularly since substantially all of our assets are subject to security interests relating to existing indebtedness;\n•\ndecreasing our profitability or cash flow;\n•\ncausing us to be less able to take advantage of significant business opportunities, such as acquisition opportunities, and to react to changes in market or industry conditions;\n•\ncausing us to be disadvantaged compared to competitors with less debt and lower debt service requirements;\n•\nresulting in a downgrade in our credit rating or the credit ratings of any of the indebtedness of our subsidiaries, which could increase the cost of further borrowings;\n•\nrequiring our debt to become due and payable upon a change in control; and\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional monies in the future to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes.\nA portion of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates that are linked to changing market interest rates. As a result, an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our debt service obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had $2.8 billion of indebtedness that bore interest at variable rates. As of December 31, 2021, our variable rate indebtedness represented 29 percent of our total indebtedness. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information related to interest rate risk.\nTo service our indebtedness, we will require a significant amount of cash and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control.\nWe depend on cash on hand and cash flows from operations to make scheduled debt payments. To a significant extent, our ability to do so is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control. We may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to repay our indebtedness when it becomes due and to meet our other cash needs. If we are unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations, we will have to adopt an alternative strategy that may include:\n•\nreducing or delaying capital expenditures;\n•\nlimiting our growth;\n•\nseeking additional capital;\n•\nselling assets; or\n•\nrestructuring or refinancing our indebtedness.\nEven if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may continue to be unable to service our indebtedness and fund our operations.\nWe may not be able to refinance our indebtedness on favorable terms, or at all. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness could materially and adversely affect our liquidity and our ongoing results of operations.\nOur ability to refinance indebtedness will depend in part on our operating and financial performance, which, in turn, is subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial, business, legislative, regulatory and other factors beyond our control. In addition, prevailing interest rates or other factors at the time of refinancing could increase our interest expense. A refinancing of our indebtedness could also require us to comply with more onerous covenants and further restrict our business operations. Our inability to refinance our indebtedness or to do so upon attractive terms could materially and adversely affect our business, prospects, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows, and make us vulnerable to adverse industry and general economic conditions.\nWe may be able to incur substantially more debt and take other actions that could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due, which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness.\nDespite our indebtedness level, we may be able to incur substantially more indebtedness in the future and such indebtedness may be secured indebtedness. The indentures or agreements governing our current indebtedness permit us to recapitalize our debt or take a number of other actions, any of which could diminish our ability to make payments on our indebtedness when due and further exacerbate the risks associated with our current level of indebtedness. If new debt is added to our or any of our existing and future subsidiaries' current debt, the related risks that we now face could intensify and we may not be able to meet all of our debt obligations.\n12\nIf we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant or comply with other covenants in certain of our debt agreements, our lenders could elect to terminate the agreements and require us to repay the outstanding borrowings, or we could face other substantial costs.\nWe rely on our ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility to provide liquidity for our business, including to fund capital expenditures, acquisitions, operating expenses and other liquidity needs. The only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of December 31, 2021, specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility. If we are unable to satisfy the financial covenant under the ABL facility or the financial tests under the accounts receivable securitization facility or comply with any of the other relevant covenants under the applicable agreement, the lenders could elect to terminate the ABL facility and/or the accounts receivable securitization facility and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. In such event, unless we are able to refinance the indebtedness coming due and replace the ABL facility and/or the accounts receivable securitization facility, we would likely not have sufficient liquidity for our business needs and would be forced to adopt an alternative strategy as described above. Even if we adopt an alternative strategy, the strategy may not be successful and we may not have sufficient liquidity to service our debt and fund our operations. Future debt arrangements we enter into may contain similar provisions.\nRestrictive covenants in certain of the agreements and instruments governing our indebtedness may adversely affect our financial and operational flexibility.\nIn addition to the financial covenant and other financial tests, various other covenants in the ABL facility, term loan facility, accounts receivable securitization facility and the other agreements governing our debt impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us and our restricted subsidiaries. Such covenants include, among other things, limitations on: (i) liens; (ii) indebtedness; (iii) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (iv) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (v) loans and other investments; (vi) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (vii) dividends, other payments and other matters affecting subsidiaries; (viii) transactions with affiliates; and (ix) issuances of preferred stock of certain subsidiaries. Future debt agreements we enter into may include similar provisions.\nThese restrictions may also make more difficult or discourage a takeover of us, whether favored or opposed by our management and/or our Board of Directors.\nOur ability to comply with these covenants may be affected by events beyond our control, and any material deviations from our forecasts could require us to seek waivers or amendments of covenants or alternative sources of financing, or to reduce expenditures. We cannot guarantee that such waivers, amendments or alternative financing could be obtained or, if obtained, would be on terms acceptable to us.\nA breach of any of the covenants or restrictions contained in these agreements could result in an event of default. Such a default could allow our debt holders to accelerate repayment of the related debt, as well as any other debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, and/or to declare all borrowings outstanding under these agreements to be due and payable. If our debt is accelerated, our assets may not be sufficient to repay such debt.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted under our ABL facility may fluctuate significantly, which may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nThe amount of borrowings permitted at any time under our ABL facility is limited to a periodic borrowing base valuation of the collateral thereunder. As a result, our access to credit under our ABL facility is potentially subject to significant fluctuations depending on the value of the borrowing base of eligible assets as of any measurement date, as well as certain discretionary rights of the agent in respect of the calculation of such borrowing base value. The inability to borrow under our ABL facility may adversely affect our liquidity, results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on available borrowings under the ABL facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility for cash to operate our business, which subjects us to market and counterparty risk, some of which is beyond our control.\nIn addition to cash we generate from our business, our principal existing sources of cash are borrowings available under the ABL facility and the accounts receivable securitization facility. If our access to such financing was unavailable or reduced,\n13\nor if such financing were to become significantly more expensive for any reason, we may not be able to fund daily operations, which would cause material harm to our business or could affect our ability to operate our business as a going concern. In addition, if certain of our lenders experience difficulties that render them unable to fund future draws on the facilities, we may not be able to access all or a portion of these funds, which could have similar adverse consequences.\nIf we are unable to obtain additional capital as required, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business.\nIf the cash that we generate from our business, together with cash that we may borrow under the ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility, is not sufficient to fund our capital requirements, we will require additional debt and/or equity financing. However, we may not succeed in obtaining the requisite additional financing or such financing may include terms that are not satisfactory to us. We may not be able to obtain additional debt financing as a result of prevailing interest rates or other factors, including the presence of covenants or other restrictions under the ABL facility and/or other agreements governing our debt. In the event we seek to obtain equity financing, our stockholders may experience dilution as a result of the issuance of additional equity securities. This dilution may be significant depending upon the amount of equity securities that we issue and the prices at which we issue such securities. If we are unable to obtain sufficient additional capital in the future, we may be unable to fund the capital outlays required for the success of our business, including those relating to purchasing equipment, growth plans and refinancing existing indebtedness.\nRisks Related to our Strategic Transactions and Investments\nOur growth strategies may be unsuccessful if we are unable to identify and complete future acquisitions and successfully integrate acquired businesses or assets.\nWe have historically achieved a significant portion of our growth through acquisitions and we will continue to consider potential acquisitions on a selective basis. From time-to-time we have also approached, or have been approached by, other public companies or large privately-held companies to explore consolidation opportunities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable acquisition opportunities in the future or that we will be able to consummate any such transactions on terms and conditions acceptable to us.\nIn addition, it is possible that we will not realize the expected benefits from any completed acquisition over the timeframe we expect, or at all, or that our existing operations will be adversely affected as a result of acquisitions. Acquisitions entail certain risks, including:\n•\nunrecorded liabilities of acquired companies and unidentified issues that we fail to discover during our due diligence investigations or that are not subject to indemnification or reimbursement by the seller;\n•\ngreater than expected expenses such as the need to obtain additional debt or equity financing for any transaction;\n•\nunfavorable accounting treatment and unexpected increases in taxes;\n•\nadverse effects on our ability to maintain relationships with customers, employees and suppliers;\n•\ninherent risk associated with entering a geographic area or line of business in which we have no or limited experience;\n•\ndifficulty in assimilating the operations and personnel of an acquired company within our existing operations, including the consolidation of corporate and administrative functions;\n•\ndifficulty in integrating marketing, information technology and other systems;\n•\ndifficulty in conforming standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n•\ndifficulty in identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets;\n•\nloss of key employees of the acquired company;\n•\noperating inefficiencies that have a negative impact on profitability;\n•\nimpairment of goodwill or other acquisition-related intangible assets;\n•\nfailure to achieve anticipated synergies or receiving an inadequate return of capital; and\n•\nstrains on management and other personnel time and resources to evaluate, negotiate and integrate acquisitions.\nOur failure to address these risks or other problems encountered in connection with any past or future acquisition could cause us to fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the acquisitions, cause us to incur unanticipated liabilities and harm our business generally. In addition, if we are unable to successfully integrate our acquisitions with our existing business, we may not obtain the advantages that the acquisitions were intended to create, which may materially and adversely affect our business,\n14\nresults of operations, financial condition, cash flows, our ability to introduce new services and products and the market price of our stock.\nWe would expect to pay for any future acquisitions using cash, capital stock, notes, other indebtedness and/or assumption of indebtedness. To the extent that our existing sources of cash are not sufficient, we would expect to need additional debt or equity financing, which involves its own risks, such as the dilutive effect on shares held by our stockholders if we financed acquisitions by issuing convertible debt or equity securities, or the risks associated with debt incurrence.\nWe have also spent resources and efforts, apart from acquisitions, in attempting to grow and enhance our rental business over the past few years. These efforts place strains on our management and other personnel time and resources, and require timely and continued investment in facilities, personnel and financial and management systems and controls. We may not be successful in implementing all of the processes that are necessary to support any of our growth initiatives, which could result in our expenses increasing disproportionately to our incremental revenues, causing our operating margins and profitability to be adversely affected.\nIf we determine that our goodwill has become impaired, we may incur impairment charges, which would negatively impact our operating results.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $5.5 billion of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet. Goodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations. We assess potential impairment of our goodwill at least annually. Impairment may result from significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets, negative industry or economic trends and/or significant underperformance relative to historic or projected operating results. For a discussion of our goodwill impairment testing, see “Critical Accounting Policies-Evaluation of Goodwill Impairment” in Part II, Item 7-Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nRisks Related to our Securities\nOur operating results may fluctuate, which could affect the trading value of our securities.\nOur revenues and operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter or over the longer term due to a number of factors, which could adversely affect the trading value of our securities. These factors, in addition to general economic conditions and the factors discussed above under “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements”, include, but are not limited to:\n•\nthe seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter;\n•\nchanges in the size of our rental fleet and/or in the rate at which we sell our used equipment;\n•\nexcess fleet in the equipment rental industry;\n•\nchanges in private non-residential construction spending or government funding for infrastructure and other construction projects;\n•\nchanges in demand for, or utilization of, our equipment or in the prices we charge due to changes in economic conditions, competition or other factors;\n•\ncommodity price pressures and the resultant increase in the cost of fuel and steel to our equipment suppliers, which can result in increased equipment costs for us;\n•\nother cost fluctuations, such as costs for employee-related compensation and healthcare benefits;\n•\nlabor shortages and/or disputes, work stoppages or other labor difficulties;\n•\npotential enactment of new legislation affecting our operations or labor relations;\n•\nsupply chain or other disruptions that impact our ability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all;\n•\ncompletion of acquisitions, divestitures or recapitalizations;\n•\nincreases in interest rates and related increases in our interest expense and our debt service obligations;\n•\nthe possible need, from time to time, to record goodwill impairment charges or other write-offs or charges due to a variety of occurrences, such as the adoption of new accounting standards, the impairment of assets, rental location divestitures, dislocation in the equity and/or credit markets, consolidations or closings, restructurings, the refinancing of existing indebtedness or the buy-out of equipment leases; and\n•\ncurrency risks and other risks associated with international operations.\n15\nOur common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future.\nOur common stock price has fluctuated significantly and may continue to do so in the future for a number of reasons, including:\n•\nannouncements of developments related to our business;\n•\nmarket perceptions of any proposed merger or acquisition and the likelihood of our involvement in other merger and acquisition activity;\n•\nvariations in our revenues, gross margins, earnings or other financial results from investors’ expectations;\n•\ndeparture of key personnel;\n•\npurchases or sales of large blocks of our stock by institutional investors or transactions by insiders;\n•\nfluctuations in the results of our operations and general conditions in the economy, our market, and the markets served by our customers;\n•\ninvestor perceptions of the equipment rental industry in general and our Company in particular;\n•\nfluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas;\n•\nexpectations regarding our share repurchase program; and\n•\nthe operating and stock performance of comparable companies or related industries.\nIn addition, prices in the stock market have been volatile over the past few years. In certain cases, the fluctuations have been unrelated to the operating performance of the affected companies. As a result, the price of our common stock could fluctuate in the future without regard to our operating performance.\nWe cannot guarantee that we will repurchase our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program or that our share repurchase program will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility of the price of our common stock and could diminish our cash reserves.\nIn January 2022, our Board of Directors authorized a new share repurchase program. Under the new program, we are authorized to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate purchase price not to exceed $1 billion, excluding fees, commissions and other ancillary expenses. The new authorization replaces the prior $500 million program, which was paused in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and under which we had $243 million of remaining authorization.\nAlthough the Board of Directors has authorized the share repurchase program, the share repurchase program does not obligate the Company to repurchase any specific dollar amount or to acquire any specific number of shares. The timing and amount of repurchases, if any, will depend upon several factors, including market and business conditions, the trading price of the Company’s common stock and the nature of other investment opportunities. In addition, the current administration has proposed a tax on share repurchases, which, if adopted in its current form or another form that makes share repurchases more expensive, may also impact our decision to engage in share repurchases. Also, our ability to repurchase shares of stock may be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements. The repurchase program may be limited, suspended or discontinued at any time without prior notice. In addition, repurchases of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program could affect our stock price and increase its volatility. The existence of a share repurchase program could cause our stock price to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our stock. Additionally, our share repurchase program could diminish our cash reserves, which may impact our ability to finance future growth and to pursue possible future strategic opportunities and acquisitions. There can be no assurance that any share repurchases will enhance stockholder value because the market price of our common stock may decline below the levels at which we repurchased shares of stock. Although our share repurchase program is intended to enhance long-term stockholder value, there is no assurance that it will do so and short-term stock price fluctuations could reduce the program’s effectiveness.\nOur charter provisions, as well as other factors, may affect the likelihood of a takeover or change of control of the Company.\nAlthough our Board elected not to extend our stockholders’ rights plan upon its expiration in 2011, we still have in place certain charter provisions that may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying or preventing changes in control or management of the Company that are not approved by our Board, including transactions in which our stockholders might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then-current market prices. We are also subject to Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law which, under certain circumstances, restricts the ability of a publicly held Delaware corporation to engage in a business combination, such as a merger or sale of assets, with any stockholder that, together with affiliates, owns 15 percent or more of the corporation’s outstanding voting stock, which similarly could prohibit or delay the accomplishment of a change of control transaction. In addition, under each of the ABL facility and the term loan facility, a\n16\nchange of control (as defined in the applicable credit agreement) constitutes an event of default, entitling our lenders to terminate the ABL facility or the term loan facility, as applicable, and require us to repay outstanding borrowings. A change of control (as defined in the applicable agreement) is also a termination event under our accounts receivable securitization facility and generally would require us to offer to repurchase our outstanding senior notes. As a result, the provisions of the agreements governing our debt also may affect the likelihood of a takeover or other change of control.\nOperational Risks\nIf we are unable to collect on contracts with customers, our operating results would be adversely affected.\nOne of the reasons some of our customers find it more attractive to rent equipment than own that equipment is the need to deploy their capital elsewhere. This has been particularly true in industries with recent high growth rates such as the construction industry. However, some of our customers may have liquidity issues and ultimately may not be able to fulfill the terms of their rental agreements with us. If we are unable to manage credit risk issues adequately, or if a large number of customers have financial difficulties at the same time, our credit losses could increase above historical levels and our operating results would be adversely affected. Further, delinquencies and credit losses generally would be expected to increase if there was a worsening of economic conditions. While delinquencies and credit losses did not materially increase during 2021, they may increase in the future if economic conditions worsen as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise.\nTurnover of members of our management and our ability to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to efficiently manage our business and execute our strategy.\nOur success is dependent, in part, on the experience and skills of our management team, and competition in our industry and the business world for top management talent is generally significant. Although we believe we generally have competitive pay packages, we can provide no assurance that our efforts to attract and retain our senior management staff will be successful. Moreover, in the past, we have experienced volatility in our stock price, and we may experience such volatility again in the future, which may make it more difficult and expensive to recruit and retain employees, particularly senior management, through grants of stock or stock options. This, in turn, could place greater pressure on the Company to increase the cash component of its compensation packages, which may adversely affect our operating results. If we are unable to fill and keep filled all of our senior management positions, or if we lose the services of any key member of our senior management team and are unable to find a suitable replacement in a timely fashion, we may be challenged to effectively manage our business and execute our strategy.\nIn addition, we must continue to identify, hire, train and retain key personnel who maintain relationships with our customers and who provide technical skills required for our Company's growth. There is a shortage of qualified personnel in these fields, and we compete with other companies for the limited pool of talent. The failure to recruit and retain necessary key personnel could cause disruption, harm our business and hamper our ability to grow our Company.\nOur operational and cost reduction strategies may not generate the improvements and efficiencies we expect.\nWe have been pursuing a general strategy of optimizing our field operations in order to address potential labor shortages, improve servicing capabilities, improve sales force effectiveness, and focus our sales force’s efforts on increasing revenues from our national account and other large customers. We also continue to pursue general cost reduction strategies. The extent to which these efforts and strategies will achieve our desired efficiencies and goals in 2022 and beyond is uncertain, as their success depends on a number of factors, some of which are beyond our control. Even if we carry out these strategies in the manner we currently expect, we may not achieve the efficiencies or savings we anticipate, or on the timetable we anticipate, and there may be unforeseen productivity, revenue or other consequences resulting from our strategies that may adversely affect us. Therefore, there can be no guarantee that our strategies will prove effective in achieving the desired level of profitability, margins or returns to stockholders.\nWe are dependent on our relationships with key suppliers to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business on acceptable terms.\nWe have achieved significant cost savings through our centralization of equipment and non-equipment purchases. However, as a result, we depend on and are exposed to the credit risk of a group of key suppliers. While we make every effort to evaluate our counterparties prior to entering into long-term and other significant procurement contracts, we cannot predict the impact on our suppliers of the economic environment and other developments in their respective businesses. Insolvency, financial difficulties or other factors may result in our suppliers not being able to fulfill the terms of their agreements with us. Further, such factors may render suppliers unwilling to extend contracts that provide favorable terms to us, or may force them to seek to renegotiate existing contracts with us. Although we believe we have alternative sources of supply for the equipment and other supplies used in our business, termination of our relationship with any of our key suppliers could have a material\n17\nadverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations in the unlikely event that we were unable to obtain adequate equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner, at a reasonable cost or at all.\nDisruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance.\nSupply chain disruptions could impact our ability to obtain equipment and other supplies for our business from our key suppliers on acceptable terms or at all. To date, our supply chain disruptions have been limited, but we may experience, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, more severe supply chain disruptions in the future or supplier inability to manufacture or deliver equipment or parts. Any suspension or delay in our suppliers’ ability to provide us adequate equipment or supplies, or in our ability to procure equipment or supplies from other sources in a timely manner or at all, could impair our ability to meet customer demand and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our rental fleet ages, our operating costs may increase, we may be unable to pass along such costs, and our earnings may decrease. The costs of new equipment we use in our fleet may increase, requiring us to spend more for replacement equipment or preventing us from procuring equipment on a timely basis.\nIf our rental equipment ages, the costs of maintaining such equipment, if not replaced within a certain period of time, will likely increase. The costs of maintenance may materially increase in the future and could lead to material adverse effects on our results of operations.\nThe cost of new equipment for use in our rental fleet could also increase due to increased material costs for our suppliers (including tariffs on raw materials) or other factors beyond our control. Such increases could materially adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations in future periods. Furthermore, changes in customer demand could cause certain of our existing equipment to become obsolete and require us to purchase new equipment at increased costs.\nDisruptions in our information technology systems or a compromise of security with respect to our systems could adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives or support our online ordering system.\nWe rely on our information technology systems to be able to monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives and support our online ordering system. Any disruptions in these systems or the failure of these systems to operate as expected could adversely affect our ability to access and use certain applications and could, depending on the nature and magnitude of the problem, adversely affect our operating results by limiting our ability to effectively monitor and control our operations, adjust to changing market conditions, implement strategic initiatives and service online orders. In addition, the security measures we employ to protect our systems may not detect or prevent all attempts to hack our systems, denial-of-service attacks, viruses, malicious software, employee error or malfeasance, phishing attacks, security breaches, disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware or integrating systems of acquired businesses, or other attacks and similar disruptions that may jeopardize the security of information stored in or transmitted by the sites, networks and systems that we otherwise maintain, which include cloud-based networks and data center storage.\nWe have, from time to time, experienced threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks. We are continuously developing and enhancing our controls, processes, and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data, and networks from attack, damage, or unauthorized access. This continued development and enhancement requires us to expend significant additional resources. However, we may not anticipate or combat all types of future attacks until after they have been launched. If any of these breaches of security occur or are anticipated in the future, we could be required to expend additional capital and other resources, including costs to deploy additional personnel and protection technologies, train employees and engage third-party experts and consultants. During the COVID-19 pandemic, we face increased cybersecurity risks due to our reliance on internet technology and the number of our employees who are working remotely, which could strain our technology resources or create additional opportunities for cybercriminals to exploit vulnerabilities.\nIn addition, because our systems sometimes contain information about individuals and businesses, our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold, whether as a result of our own error or the malfeasance or errors of others, have led, in one limited instance, and could in the future lead, to disruptions in our online ordering system or other data systems, and could lead to unauthorized release of confidential or otherwise protected information or corruption of data. Our failure to appropriately maintain the security of the data we hold could also violate applicable privacy, data security and other laws and subject us to lawsuits, fines and other means of regulatory enforcement. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (Regulation (EU) 2016/679) (the “GDPR”) has caused European Union (“EU”) data protection requirements to be more stringent and provides for greater penalties. Non-compliance with the GDPR could lead to lower revenues, increased costs (including fines, which could be significant) and other material adverse effects on our results of operations. In addition,\n18\ncountries such as the United Kingdom (the “UK”) have implemented the GDPR through their own legislation, for example, the UK Data Protection Act 2018, and certain countries and U.S. states have proposed or adopted their own data protection legislation. Complying with any new regulatory requirements could require us to incur substantial expenses or require us to change our business practices in a manner that could harm our business.\nAny compromise or breach of our systems could result in adverse publicity, harm our reputation, lead to claims against us and affect our relationships with our customers and employees, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. Certain of our software applications are also utilized by third parties who provide outsourced administrative functions, which may increase the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Although we maintain insurance coverage for various cybersecurity risks, there can be no guarantee that all costs or losses incurred will be fully insured.\nClimate change, climate change regulations and greenhouse effects may materially adversely impact our operations and markets.\nClimate change and its association with greenhouse gas emissions is receiving increased attention from the scientific and political communities. The U.S. federal government, certain U.S. states and certain other countries and regions have adopted or are considering legislation or regulation imposing overall caps or taxes on greenhouse gas emissions from certain sectors or facility categories. Such new laws or regulations, or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations, could increase the costs of operating our businesses, reduce the demand for our products and services and impact the prices we charge our customers, any or all of which could adversely affect our results of operations. Failure to comply with any legislation or regulation could potentially result in substantial fines, criminal sanctions or operational changes. Moreover, even without such legislation or regulation, the perspectives of our customers, stockholders, employees and other stakeholders regarding climate change are continuing to evolve, and increased awareness of, or any adverse publicity regarding, the effects of greenhouse gases could harm our reputation or reduce customer demand for our products and services.\nAdditionally, as severe weather events become increasingly common, our or our customers’ operations may be disrupted, which could result in increased operational costs or reduced demand for our products and services, and climate change may also reduce the availability or increase the cost of insurance for weather-related events. In addition, climate change may impact the global economy, including as a result of disruptions to supply chains. While we have invested in the administration of programs and physical loss prevention improvements to mitigate the risk of natural disasters causing disruption to our ability to serve our customers and communities in times of need, extended periods of disruptions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. We anticipate that climate change-related risks will increase over time.\nOur rental fleet is subject to residual value risk upon disposition, and may not sell at the prices or in the quantities we expect.\nThe market value of any given piece of rental equipment could be less than its depreciated value at the time it is sold. The market value of used rental equipment depends on several factors, including:\n•\nthe market price for new equipment of a like kind;\n•\nwear and tear on the equipment relative to its age and the performance of preventive maintenance;\n•\nthe time of year that it is sold;\n•\nthe supply of used equipment on the market;\n•\nthe existence and capacities of different sales outlets;\n•\nthe age of the equipment at the time it is sold;\n•\nworldwide and domestic demand for used equipment; and\n•\ngeneral economic conditions.\nWe include in income from operations the difference between the sales price and the depreciated value of an item of equipment sold. Changes in our assumptions regarding depreciation could change our depreciation expense, as well as the gain or loss realized upon disposal of equipment. Sales of our used rental equipment at prices that fall significantly below our projections and/or in lesser quantities than we anticipate will have a negative impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nWe have operations outside the United States, in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand. As a result, we may incur losses from the impact of foreign currency fluctuations and have higher costs than we otherwise would have due to the need to comply with foreign laws.\nOur operations in Canada, Europe, Australia and New Zealand are subject to the risks normally associated with international operations. These include (i) the need to convert currencies, which could result in a gain or loss depending on\n19\nfluctuations in exchange rates and (ii) the need to comply with foreign laws and regulations, as well as U.S. laws and regulations, applicable to our operations in foreign jurisdictions. Changes in such laws or regulations, or any material failure to comply with any applicable laws or regulations, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways. In addition, laws or regulations or the interpretations thereof can conflict among jurisdictions, and compliance in one jurisdiction could result in legal or reputational risks in another jurisdiction. See Item 7A—Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk for additional information related to currency exchange risk.\nWe have a holding company structure and depend in part on distributions from our subsidiaries to pay amounts due on our indebtedness. Certain provisions of law or contractual restrictions could limit distributions from our subsidiaries.\nWe derive substantially all of our operating income from, and hold substantially all of our assets through, our subsidiaries. The effect of this structure is that we depend in part on the earnings of our subsidiaries, and the payment or other distribution to us of these earnings, to meet our obligations under our outstanding debt. Provisions of law, such as those requiring that dividends be paid only from surplus, could limit the ability of our subsidiaries to make payments or other distributions to us. Furthermore, these subsidiaries could in certain circumstances agree to contractual restrictions on their ability to make distributions. Distributions from our subsidiaries may also be limited by restrictive covenants in our debt agreements.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business, and our insurance may not fully cover them.\nWe are in the ordinary course exposed to a variety of claims relating to our business. These claims include those relating to (i) personal injury or property damage involving equipment rented or sold by us, (ii) motor vehicle accidents involving our vehicles and our employees and (iii) employment-related claims. Currently, we carry a broad range of insurance for the protection of our assets and operations. However, such insurance may not fully cover these claims for a number of reasons, including:\n•\nour insurance policies, reflecting a program structure that we believe reflects market conditions for companies our size, are often subject to significant deductibles or self-insured retentions;\n•\nour director and officer liability insurance policy has no deductible for individual non-indemnifiable loss, but is subject to a deductible for company reimbursement coverage;\n•\nwe do not currently maintain Company-wide stand-alone coverage for environmental liability (other than legally required coverage), since we believe the cost for such coverage is high relative to the benefit it provides; and\n•\ncertain types of claims, such as claims for punitive damages or for damages arising from intentional misconduct, which are often alleged in third party lawsuits, might not be covered by our insurance.\nWe establish and semi-annually evaluate our loss reserves to address casualty claims, or portions thereof, not covered by our insurance policies. To the extent that we are subject to a higher frequency of claims, are subject to more serious claims or insurance coverage is not available, we could have to significantly increase our reserves, and our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected. It is also possible that some or all of the insurance that is currently available to us will not be available in the future on economically reasonable terms or at all.\nWe are subject to numerous environmental and safety regulations. If we are required to incur compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected.\nOur operations are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing environmental protection and occupational health and safety matters. These laws regulate issues such as wastewater, stormwater, solid and hazardous waste and materials, and air quality. Under these laws, we may be liable for, among other things, (i) the costs of investigating and remediating any contamination at our sites as well as sites to which we send hazardous waste for disposal or treatment, regardless of fault, and (ii) fines and penalties for non-compliance. While our operations generally do not raise significant environmental risks, we use hazardous materials to clean and maintain equipment, dispose of solid and hazardous waste and wastewater from equipment washing, and store and dispense petroleum products from above-ground storage tanks located at certain of our locations.\nWe cannot be certain as to the potential financial impact on our business if new adverse environmental conditions are discovered. If we are required to incur environmental compliance or remediation costs that are not currently anticipated, our liquidity and operating results could be materially and adversely affected, depending on the magnitude of such costs. In addition, as environmental and safety regulations have tended to become stricter, we could incur additional costs in complying\n20\nwith requirements that are promulgated in the future. These include climate change regulation, which could materially affect our operating results through increased compliance costs.\nWe have operations throughout the United States, which exposes us to multiple state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and requirements as a government contractor. Changes in applicable law, regulations or requirements, or our material failure to comply with any of them, can increase our costs and have other negative impacts on our business.\nOur 1,149 branch locations in the United States are located in 49 states, and Puerto Rico, which exposes us to a host of different state and local regulations, in addition to federal law and regulatory and contractual requirements we face as a government contractor. These laws and requirements address multiple aspects of our operations, such as worker safety, consumer rights, privacy, employee benefits and more, and there are often different and potentially conflicting requirements in different jurisdictions. Changes in these requirements, or any material failure by our branches to comply with them, can increase our costs, affect our reputation, limit our business, drain management time and attention and otherwise impact our operations in adverse ways.\nOur collective bargaining agreements and our relationship with our union-represented employees could disrupt our ability to serve our customers, lead to higher labor costs or the payment of withdrawal liability.\nWe currently have approximately 1,450 employees who are represented by unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements and approximately 18,950 employees who are not represented by unions. Various unions occasionally seek to organize certain of our nonunion employees. Union organizing efforts or collective bargaining negotiations could potentially lead to work stoppages and/or slowdowns or strikes by certain of our employees, which could adversely affect our ability to serve our customers. Further, settlement of actual or threatened labor disputes or an increase in the number of our employees covered by collective bargaining agreements can have unknown effects on our labor costs, productivity and flexibility.\nUnder the collective bargaining agreements that we have signed, we are obligated to contribute to several multiemployer pension plans on behalf of some of our unionized employees. A multiemployer pension plan is a plan that covers the union-represented workers of various unrelated companies. Under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, a contributing employer to an underfunded multiemployer plan is liable, generally upon withdrawal from a plan, for its proportionate share of the plan's unfunded vested liability. We currently have no intention of withdrawing from any multiemployer plan. However, there can be no assurance that we will not withdraw from one or more multiemployer plans in the future and be required to pay material amounts of withdrawal liability if one or more of those plans are underfunded at the time of withdrawal.\n21"

    "text": "As discussed in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements, in 2021, we adopted SEC guidance that is intended to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain disclosures throughout this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” In accordance with this guidance, we have omitted discussions comparing 2020 and 2019 results, as such disclosures were included in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020. As discussed below, in March 2020, we first experienced rental volume declines associated with COVID-19, and the COVID-19 impact was more pronounced in 2020 than 2021. Our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2021 include detailed disclosures addressing the COVID-19 response plan that is summarized below.\nCOVID-19\nAs discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, the COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See \"Item 1. Business-Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020.\nWe began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, which is when the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic and when our rental volume first declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021, and we have seen recent evidence of recovery across our construction and industrial markets, as well as encouraging gains in end-market indicators, as reflected in our 2022 forecast. In early March 2020, we initiated contingency planning ahead of the impact of COVID-19 on our end-markets.\nOur COVID-19 response plan is focused on five work-streams: 1) ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and customers, 2) leveraging our competitive advantages to support the needs of customers, 3) aggressively managing capital expenditures, 4) controlling core operating expenses and 5) proactively managing the balance sheet with a focus on liquidity. We believe that this response plan helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results. As noted above, our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 and our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q filed in 2021 include additional detailed COVID-19 disclosures. The impact of COVID-19 on our business is discussed throughout this “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nExecutive Overview\nWe are the largest equipment rental company in the world, with an integrated network of 1,345 rental locations. We primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand (see Item 2—Properties for further detail). Although the equipment rental industry is highly fragmented and diverse, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of this environment because, as a larger company, we have more extensive resources and certain competitive advantages. These include a fleet of rental equipment with a total original equipment cost (“OEC”) of $15.8 billion, and a North American branch network that operates in 49 U.S. states and every Canadian province, and serves 99 of the 100 largest metropolitan areas in the U.S. Our size also gives us greater purchasing power, the ability to provide customers with a broader range of equipment and services, the ability to provide customers with equipment that is more consistently well-maintained and therefore more productive and reliable, and the ability to enhance the earning potential of our assets by transferring equipment among branches to satisfy customer needs.\nWe offer approximately 4,300 classes of equipment for rent to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. Our revenues are derived from the following sources: equipment rentals, sales of rental equipment, sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues. In 2021, equipment rental revenues represented 84 percent of our total revenues.\nFor the past several years, we have executed a strategy focused on improving the profitability of our core equipment rental business through revenue growth, margin expansion and operational efficiencies. In particular, we have focused on customer segmentation, customer service differentiation, rate management, fleet management and operational efficiency.\nWe are continuing to manage the impact of COVID-19, which is discussed above. Our general strategy focuses on profitability and return on invested capital, and, in particular, calls for:\n25\n•\nA consistently superior standard of service to customers\n, often provided through a single lead contact who can coordinate the cross-selling of the various services we offer throughout our network. We utilize a proprietary software application, Total Control\n®\n, which provides our key customers with a single in-house software application that enables them to monitor and manage all their equipment needs. Total Control\n®\nis a unique customer offering that enables us to develop strong, long-term relationships with our larger customers. Our digital capabilities, including our Total Control\n®\nplatform, allow our sales teams to provide contactless end-to-end customer service;\n•\nThe further optimization of our customer mix and fleet mix,\nwith a dual objective: to enhance our performance in serving our current customer base, and to focus on the accounts and customer types that are best suited to our strategy for profitable growth. We believe these efforts will lead to even better service of our target accounts, primarily large construction and industrial customers, as well as select local contractors. Our fleet team's analyses are aligned with these objectives to identify trends in equipment categories and define action plans that can generate improved returns;\n•\nA continued focus on “Lean” management techniques, including kaizen processes focused on continuous improvement\n. We continue to implement Lean kaizen processes across our branch network, with the objectives of: reducing the cycle time associated with renting our equipment to customers; improving invoice accuracy and service quality; reducing the elapsed time for equipment pickup and delivery; and improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our repair and maintenance operations;\n•\nThe continued expansion of our specialty footprint, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, and the cross-selling of these services throughout our network\n. We believe that the expansion of our specialty business, as exhibited by our acquisition of General Finance discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, as well as our tools and onsite services offerings, will further position United Rentals as a single source provider of total jobsite solutions through our extensive product and service resources and technology offerings; and\n•\nThe pursuit of strategic acquisitions to continue to expand our core equipment rental business\n. Strategic acquisitions allow us to invest our capital to expand our business, further driving our ability to accomplish our strategic goals.\nIn 2022, based on our analyses of industry forecasts and macroeconomic indicators, we expect a continuation of the market recovery experienced in 2021, following a market decline in 2020, which included the pronounced impact of COVID-19. Specifically, we expect that North American industry equipment rental revenue will increase approximately 10 percent in 2022. See \"Item 1. Business- Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020.\nAs discussed below, fleet productivity is a comprehensive metric that reflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. For the full year 2021:\n•\nEquipment rentals increased 14.9 percent year-over-year, including the impact of the May 2021 acquisition of General Finance discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements;\n•\nAverage OEC increased 4.0 percent year-over-year, including the impact of the General Finance acquisition;\n•\nFleet productivity increased 10.4 percent, primarily due to improved fleet absorption in 2021. 2020 reflected more pronounced rental volume declines associated with COVID-19, and in 2021, we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets; and\n•\n72 percent of equipment rental revenue was derived from key accounts, as compared to 74 percent in 2020. Key accounts are each managed by a single point of contact to enhance customer service. The slight decrease from 2020 includes the impact of the General Finance acquisition, which added revenue from Australia and New Zealand that is not from key accounts.\nFinancial Overview\nPrior to taking actions pertaining to our financial flexibility and liquidity, we consider the impact of COVID-19 on liquidity, and assess our available sources and anticipated uses of cash, including, with respect to sources, cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment. In 2021, we took the following actions to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity, and to position us to invest the necessary capital in our business:\n•\nIssued $750 principal amount of 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Senior Notes due 2032;\n•\nRedeemed all $1 billion principal amount of our 5\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes due 2026; and\n•\nAmended and extended our accounts receivable securitization facility, which expires on June 24, 2022 and may be further extended on a 364-day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility, including an increase in the size of the facility from $800 to $900.\n26\nTotal debt as of December 31, 2021 was flat year-over-year. In 2021, borrowings under the ABL facility were used to fund most of the cost of the General Finance acquisition discussed above. 2021 debt activity also included the use of cash generated from operations, net of the funds used for capital expenditures, to reduce borrowings under the ABL facility (excluding the impact of the General Finance acquisition) and the net impact of the debt issuance and redemption discussed above. As of December 31, 2021, we had available liquidity of $2.851 billion, comprised of cash and cash equivalents, and availability under the ABL and accounts receivable securitization facilities.\nNet income\n. Net income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 are presented below.\nNet income and diluted earnings per share for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 include the after-tax impacts of the items below. The tax rates applied to the items below reflect the statutory rates in the applicable entities.\n(1)\nThis primarily reflects transaction costs associated with the General Finance acquisition discussed above. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions completed since 2012 that significantly impact our operations (the \"major acquisitions,\" each of which had annual revenues of over $200 prior to acquisition). For additional information, see \"Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-merger related costs\" below.\n(2)\nThis reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the major acquisitions.\n(3)\nThis reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment.\n(4)\nThis reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold.\n(5)\nAs discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs.\n(6)\nThis reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. As discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, the 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19.\n(7)\nReflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see \"Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net\" below.\nEBITDA GAAP Reconciliations\n.\nEBITDA represents the sum of net income, provision for income taxes, interest expense, net, depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA represents EBITDA plus the sum of the merger related costs, restructuring charge, stock compensation expense, net, and the impact of the fair value mark-up of acquired fleet. These items are excluded from adjusted EBITDA internally when evaluating our operating performance and for strategic planning and forecasting purposes, and allow investors to make a more meaningful comparison between our core business operating results over different periods of time, as well as with those of other similar companies. The\n27\nnet income and adjusted EBITDA margins represent net income or adjusted EBITDA divided by total revenue. Management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA, when viewed with the Company’s results under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and the accompanying reconciliations, provide useful information about operating performance and period-over-period growth, and provide additional information that is useful for evaluating the operating performance of our core business without regard to potential distortions. Additionally, management believes that EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA help investors gain an understanding of the factors and trends affecting our ongoing cash earnings, from which capital investments are made and debt is serviced. However, EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP and, accordingly, should not be considered as alternatives to net income or cash flow from operating activities as indicators of operating performance or liquidity.\nThe table below provides a reconciliation between net income and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\nThe table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA:\n28\n_________________\n(1)\nThis primarily reflects transaction costs associated with the General Finance acquisition discussed above. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations. For additional information, see \"Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-merger related costs\" below.\n(2)\nAs discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs.\n(3)\nRepresents non-cash, share-based payments associated with the granting of equity instruments.\n(4)\nThis reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold.\n(5)\nReflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. For additional information, see \"Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-Interest expense, net\" below.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net income increased $496, or 55.7 percent, and net income margin increased 390 basis points to 14.3 percent. For the year ended December 31, 2021, adjusted EBITDA increased $482, or 12.3 percent, and adjusted EBITDA margin decreased 70 basis points to 45.4 percent.\nThe year-over-year increase in net income margin primarily reflected a reduction in interest expense, improved gross margins from equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment and decreased non-rental depreciation and amortization as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") and income tax expenses. Net interest expense decreased $245, or 37 percent, year-over-year. Excluding the impact of debt redemption losses, net interest expense decreased 19 percent year-over-year, primarily due to decreases in both average debt and the average cost of debt. Equipment rentals gross margin increased year-over-year primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher bonus expense primarily due to improved profitability, and increases in certain operating expenses, including delivery costs, as a percentage of revenue. Gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market. Non-rental depreciation and amortization decreased 4 percent year-over-year, which equated to a significant improvement as a percentage of revenue. SG&A expense increased year-over-year primarily due to higher bonus and stock compensation expenses, which reflect improved profitability. Year-over-year, income tax expense increased $211, or 85 percent, and the effective income tax rate increased by 300 basis points, primarily reflecting the release in 2020 of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\n29\nThe decrease in the adjusted EBITDA margin primarily reflects lower margins from equipment rentals (excluding depreciation) and increased SG&A expense, partially offset by higher margins from sales of rental equipment. Gross margin from equipment rentals (excluding depreciation) decreased 110 basis points primarily due to a higher bonus accrual, which reflects improved profitability, and increases in certain operating expenses, including delivery costs, as a percentage of revenue. SG&A expense increased primarily due to increased bonus expense, which reflects improved profitability. Gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market.\nRevenues.\nRevenues for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n_________________\n(1)\nReflects the estimated impact of inflation on the revenue productivity of fleet based on OEC, which is recorded at cost.\n(2)\nReflects the combined impact of changes in rental rates, time utilization, and mix that contribute to the variance in owned equipment rental revenue. See note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the different types of equipment rentals revenue. Rental rate changes are calculated based on the year-over-year variance in average contract rates, weighted by the prior period revenue mix. Time utilization is calculated by dividing the amount of time an asset is on rent by the amount of time the asset has been owned during the year. Mix includes the impact of changes in customer, fleet, geographic and segment mix. The positive fleet productivity for 2021 and the negative fleet productivity for 2020 include the impact of COVID-19, which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions, as discussed further above. The COVID-19 volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021, and in 2021, we saw evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets.\n(3)\nReflects the combined impact of changes in the other types of equipment rentals revenue (see note 3 for further detail), excluding owned equipment rental revenue.\nEquipment rentals include our revenues from renting equipment, as well as revenue related to the fees we charge customers: for equipment delivery and pick-up; to protect the customer against liability for damage to our equipment while on rent; for fuel; and for environmental costs. Collectively, these \"ancillary fees\" represented approximately 14 percent of equipment rental revenue in 2021. Delivery and pick-up revenue, which represented approximately eight percent of equipment rental revenue in 2021, is the most significant ancillary revenue component. Sales of rental equipment represent our revenues from the sale of used rental equipment. Sales of new equipment represent our revenues from the sale of new equipment. Contractor supplies sales represent our sales of supplies utilized by contractors, which include construction consumables, tools, small equipment and safety supplies. Services and other revenues primarily represent our revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet (including parts sales). See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue recognition accounting.\n2021 total revenues of $9.7 billion increased 13.9 percent compared with 2020. Equipment rentals and sales of rental equipment are our largest revenue types (together, they accounted for 94 percent of total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021). Equipment rentals increased 14.9 percent, primarily due to a 10.4 percent increase in fleet productivity, which included the more pronounced impact of COVID-19, which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions, in 2020. COVID-19 began to impact our operations in March 2020. In 2021, we have seen evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets. Sales of rental equipment increased 12.8 percent, primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market and the impact of the General Finance acquisition.\n30\nCritical Accounting Policies\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with GAAP. A summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. In applying many accounting principles, we make assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. These assumptions, estimates and/or judgments are often subjective and may change based on changing circumstances or changes in our analysis. Material changes in these assumptions, estimates and/or judgments have the potential to materially alter our results of operations. We have identified below our accounting policies that we believe could potentially produce materially different results if we were to change underlying assumptions, estimates and/or judgments. Although actual results may differ from those estimates, we believe the estimates are reasonable and appropriate.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\n. We maintain allowances for doubtful accounts. These allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances. Trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written-off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes. Write-offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds. See note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\nUseful Lives and Salvage Values of Rental Equipment and Property and Equipment.\nWe depreciate rental equipment and property and equipment over their estimated useful lives, after giving effect to an estimated salvage value which ranges from zero percent to 50 percent of cost. The weighted average salvage value of our rental equipment is 11 percent of cost (immaterial salvage values are assigned to our property and equipment). Rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent.\nThe useful life of an asset is determined based on our estimate of the period over which the asset can generate revenues; such periods are periodically reviewed for reasonableness. In addition, the salvage value, which is also reviewed periodically for reasonableness, is determined based on our estimate of the minimum value we will realize from the asset after such period. We may be required to change these estimates based on changes in our industry or other changing circumstances. If these estimates change in the future, we may be required to recognize increased or decreased depreciation expense for these assets.\nTo the extent that the useful lives of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one year, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately $170 or $213, respectively. If the estimated salvage values of all of our rental equipment were to increase or decrease by one percentage point, we estimate that our annual depreciation expense would change by approximately $19. Any change in depreciation expense as a result of a hypothetical change in either useful lives or salvage values would generally result in a proportional increase or decrease in the gross profit we would recognize upon the ultimate sale of the asset. To the extent that the useful lives of all of our depreciable property and equipment were to increase or decrease by one year, we estimate that our annual non-rental depreciation expense would decrease or increase by approximately $36 or $55, respectively.\nAcquisition Accounting\n. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets (principally rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data. The intangible assets that we have acquired are non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows.\nDetermining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The significant judgments include estimation of future cash flows, which is dependent on forecasts; estimation of the long-term rate of growth; estimation of the useful life over which cash flows will occur; and determination of a risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. When appropriate, our estimates of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired include assistance from independent third-party appraisal firms. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. As discussed below, we regularly review for impairments.\n31\nWhen we make an acquisition, we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities. These other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities' balance sheets.\nEvaluation of Goodwill Impairment\n. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant (either a taxable or nontaxable transaction).\nWhen conducting the goodwill impairment test, we are required to compare the fair value of our reporting units (which are our regions) with the carrying amount. As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, our divisions were our operating segments. We conducted the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2021 at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. We conducted the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2020 at the same reporting unit level, although at that time, the reporting unit was also the operating segment (see note 5 for further discussion of our segment structure).\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our Company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions. We believe this approach, which utilizes multiple valuation techniques, yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value.\nInherent in our preparation of cash flow projections are assumptions and estimates derived from a review of our operating results, business plans, expected growth rates, cost of capital and tax rates. We also make certain forecasts about future economic conditions, interest rates and other market data. Many of the factors used in assessing fair value are outside the control of management, and these assumptions and estimates may change in future periods. Changes in assumptions or estimates could materially affect the estimate of the fair value of a reporting unit, and therefore could affect the likelihood and amount of potential impairment. The following assumptions are significant to our income approach:\nBusiness Projections\n- We make assumptions about the level of equipment rental activity in the marketplace and cost levels. These assumptions drive our planning assumptions for pricing and utilization and also represent key inputs for developing our cash flow projections. These projections are developed using our internal business plans over a ten-year planning period that are updated at least annually;\nLong-term Growth Rates\n- Beyond the planning period, we also utilize an assumed long-term growth rate representing the expected rate at which a reporting unit's cash flow stream is projected to grow. These rates are used to calculate the terminal value of our reporting units, and are added to the cash flows projected during our ten-year planning period; and\nDiscount Rates\n- Each reporting unit's estimated future cash flows are discounted at a rate that is consistent with a weighted-average cost of capital that is likely to be expected by market participants. The weighted-average cost of capital is an estimate of the overall after-tax rate of return required by equity and debt holders of a business enterprise.\nThe market approach is one of the other methods used for estimating the fair value of our reporting units' business enterprise. This approach takes two forms: The first is based on the market value (market capitalization plus interest-bearing liabilities) and operating metrics (e.g., revenue and EBITDA) of companies engaged in the same or similar line of business. The second form is based on multiples paid in recent acquisitions of companies.\nIn connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of October 1, 2021, we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts. Our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 59 percent. As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance. All of the assets in the Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units were acquired in the General Finance acquisition. The estimated fair values of our Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by 10 percent and 17 percent, respectively. As all of the assets in the Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units were recorded at fair value as of the May 2021 acquisition date, we\n32\nexpected the percentages by which the fair values for these reporting units exceeded the carrying values to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units.\nIn connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of October 1, 2020, we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts. We considered the impact of COVID-19 when performing the test, and it did not have a material impact on the test results. Our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least 42 percent. As discussed above, in July 2018, we completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. All of the assets in the Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit were acquired in the BakerCorp acquisition. The estimated fair value of our Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by 22 percent. As all of the assets in the Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the July 2018 acquisition date, we expected the percentage by which the Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets (Excluding Goodwill).\nWe review the recoverability of our rental equipment, property and equipment and lease assets when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If there are such indications, we assess our ability to recover the carrying value of the assets from their expected future pre-tax cash flows (undiscounted and without interest charges). If the expected cash flows are less than the carrying value of the assets, an impairment loss is recognized for the difference between the estimated fair value and carrying value. We also conduct impairment reviews in connection with branch consolidations and other changes in our business. As discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded asset impairment charges of $14, $36 and $5, respectively. The 2020 charges principally related to the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19.\nIn support of our review for indicators of impairment, we perform a review of all assets at the district level relative to district performance and conclude whether indicators of impairment exist associated with our long-lived assets, including rental equipment. We also specifically review the financial performance of our rental equipment. Such review includes an estimate of the future rental revenues from our rental assets based on current and expected utilization levels, the age of the assets and their remaining useful lives. Additionally, we estimate when the assets are expected to be removed or retired from our rental fleet as well as the expected proceeds to be realized upon disposition. Based on our most recently completed quarterly reviews, there were no indications of impairment associated with our rental equipment, property and equipment or lease assets.\nIncome Taxes\n. We recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for certain future deductible or taxable temporary differences expected to be reported in our income tax returns. These deferred tax assets and liabilities are computed using the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods when the related future deductible or taxable temporary difference is expected to be settled or realized. In the case of deferred tax assets, the future realization of the deferred tax benefits and carryforwards are determined with consideration to historical profitability, projected future taxable income, the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences, and tax planning strategies. After consideration of all these factors, we recognize deferred tax assets when we believe that it is more likely than not that we will realize them. The most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets.\nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nWe are subject to ongoing tax examinations and assessments in various jurisdictions. Accordingly, accruals for tax contingencies are established based on the probable outcomes of such matters. Our ongoing assessments of the probable outcomes of the examinations and related tax accruals require judgment and could increase or decrease our effective tax rate as well as impact our operating results.\nWe have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no taxes were provided on such earnings prior to the fourth quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs, and determined that such cash could no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result, our prior assertion that all undistributed earnings of our foreign\n33\nsubsidiaries should be considered indefinitely reinvested changed. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified additional cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs, and remitted $203 of cash from foreign operations (such amount represents the cumulative amount of identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs). The taxes recorded associated with the remitted cash were immaterial in both 2020 and 2021.\nWe continue to expect that the remaining balance of our undistributed foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. If we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nReserves for Claims\n. We are exposed to various claims relating to our business, including those for which we retain portions of the losses through the application of deductibles and self-insured retentions, which we sometimes refer to as “self-insurance.” These claims include (i) workers' compensation claims and (ii) claims by third parties for injury or property damage involving our equipment, vehicles or personnel. These types of claims may take a substantial amount of time to resolve and, accordingly, the ultimate liability associated with a particular claim may not be known for an extended period of time. Our methodology for developing self-insurance reserves is based on management estimates, which incorporate periodic actuarial valuations. Our estimation process considers, among other matters, the cost of known claims over time, cost inflation and incurred but not reported claims. These estimates may change based on, among other things, changes in our claims history or receipt of additional information relevant to assessing the claims. Further, these estimates may prove to be inaccurate due to factors such as adverse judicial determinations or settlements at higher than estimated amounts. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our reserve levels.\nResults of Operations\nAs discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, our reportable segments are general rentals and specialty. The general rentals segment includes the rental of construction, aerial, industrial and homeowner equipment and related services and activities. The general rentals segment’s customers include construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. This segment operates throughout the United States and Canada. The specialty segment includes the rental of specialty construction products such as i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, ii) power and HVAC equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment, iii) fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment, transfer and treatment, and iv) mobile storage equipment and modular office space. The specialty segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment primarily operates in the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\nAs discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, we aggregate our four geographic divisions—Central, Northeast, Southeast and West—into our general rentals reporting segment. Historically, there have occasionally been variances in the levels of equipment rentals gross margins achieved by these divisions, though such variances have generally been small (close to or less than 10 percent, measured versus the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' divisions). For the five year period ended December 31, 2021, there was no general rentals' division with an equipment rentals gross margin that differed materially from the equipment rentals gross margin of the aggregated general rentals' divisions. The rental industry is cyclical, and there historically have occasionally been divisions with equipment rentals gross margins that varied by greater than 10 percent from the equipment rentals gross margins of the aggregated general rentals' divisions, though the specific divisions with margin variances of over 10 percent have fluctuated, and such variances have generally not exceeded 10 percent by a significant amount. We monitor the margin variances and confirm margin similarity between divisions on a quarterly basis.\nWe believe that the divisions that are aggregated into our segments have similar economic characteristics, as each division is capital intensive, offers similar products to similar customers, uses similar methods to distribute its products, and is subject to similar competitive risks. The aggregation of our divisions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance. Although we believe aggregating these divisions into our reporting segments for segment reporting purposes is appropriate, to the extent that there are significant margin variances that do not converge, we may be required to disaggregate the divisions into separate reporting segments. Any such disaggregation would have no impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nThese reporting segments align our external segment reporting with how management evaluates business performance and allocates resources. We evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit. Our revenues, operating results, and financial condition fluctuate from quarter to quarter reflecting the seasonal rental patterns of our customers, with rental activity tending to be lower in the winter.\nRevenues by segment were as follows:\n34\nEquipment rentals.\n2021 equipment rentals of $8.2 billion increased 14.9 percent as compared to 2020, primarily due to a 10.4 percent increase in fleet productivity, which included the more pronounced impact of COVID-19, which resulted in rental volume declines in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions, in 2020. COVID-19 began to impact our operations in March 2020. In 2021, we have seen evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets. Equipment rentals represented 84 percent of total revenues in\n2021.\nOn a segment basis, equipment rentals represented 83 percent and 90 percent of total revenues for general rentals and specialty, respectively. General rentals equipment rentals increased 11.0 percent as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased fleet productivity, which included the more pronounced impact of COVID-19 during 2020. In 2021, we have seen evidence of a continuing recovery of activity across our end-markets. Specialty rentals increased 27.9 percent as compared to 2020, including the impact of the General Finance acquisition. On a pro forma basis including the standalone, pre-acquisition revenues of General Finance, equipment rentals increased 18 percent. The increase in equipment rentals reflects increased fleet productivity, which included the more pronounced impact of COVID-19 during 2020, as well as a slight increase in average OEC.\nSales of rental equipment\n. For the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, sales of rental equipment represented approximately 10 percent of our total revenues. Our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales. 2021 sales of rental equipment increased 12.8 percent from 2020 primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market and the impact of the General Finance acquisition.\nSales of new equipment\n. For the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, sales of new equipment represented approximately 3 percent of our total revenues. Our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales. 2021 sales of new equipment of $203 decreased 17.8 percent from 2020 primarily due to supply chain challenges. For a discussion of the risks associated with supply chain disruptions, see Item 1A- Risk Factors (“Operational Risks-\nDisruptions in our supply chain could result in adverse effects on our results of operations and financial performance\n\").\nSales of contractor supplies\n. For the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, sales of contractor supplies represented approximately 1 percent of our total revenues. Our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales. 2021 sales of contractor supplies did not change materially from 2020.\n35\nService and other revenues\n. For the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, service and other revenues represented approximately 2 percent of our total revenues. Our general rentals segment accounted for most of these sales. 2021 service and other revenues increased 22.5 percent from 2020 primarily due to the more pronounced impact of COVID-19 in 2020.\nFourth Quarter Items\n. There were no unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 that had a material impact on our financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we redeemed all of our 4\n5\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes due 2025 using borrowings available under our ABL facility. Upon redemption, we recognized a loss of $24 in interest expense, net, reflecting the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes.\nSegment Equipment Rentals Gross Profit\nSegment equipment rentals gross profit and gross margin for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nGeneral rentals.\nFor the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, general rentals accounted for 72 percent of our total equipment rentals gross profit. This contribution percentage is consistent with general rentals’ equipment rental revenue contribution over the same period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, general rentals’ equipment rentals gross profit increased by $315, and equipment rentals gross margin increased by 170 basis points, from 2020, which included a $26 asset impairment charge that primarily reflected the discontinuation of certain equipment programs and was not related to COVID-19. Excluding the impact of asset impairment charges, equipment rentals gross margin increased 130 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher bonus accrual, which reflects improved profitability, and increases in certain operating expenses, including delivery costs, as a percentage of revenue.\nSpecialty\n. For the year ended December 31, 2021, equipment rentals gross profit increased by $233, and equipment rentals gross margin increased by 90 basis points from 2020. Gross margin increased primarily due to decreases in depreciation and labor expenses as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by a higher proportion of revenue from certain lower margin ancillary fees in 2021 and increases in certain operating expenses, including delivery costs, as a percentage of revenue.\nGross Margin\n. Gross margins by revenue classification were as follows:\n2021 gross margin of 39.7 percent increased 240 basis points from 2020. Equipment rentals gross margin increased 170 basis points from 2020, which included a $30 asset impairment charge that primarily reflected the discontinuation of certain equipment programs and was not related to COVID-19. Excluding the impact of asset impairment charges, equipment rentals\n36\ngross margin increased 150 basis points year-over-year, primarily due to a reduction in depreciation expense as a percentage of revenue, partially offset by higher bonus expense, which reflects improved profitability, and increases in certain operating expenses, including delivery costs, as a percentage of revenue. Gross margin from sales of rental equipment increased 580 basis points from 2020 primarily due to improved pricing in a strong used equipment market. The gross margin fluctuations from sales of new equipment, contractor supplies sales and service and other revenues generally reflect normal variability, the more pronounced impact of COVID-19 in 2020 and the impact of the General Finance acquisition, and such revenue types did not account for a significant portion of total gross profit (gross profit for these revenue types represented 4 percent of total gross profit for the year ended December 31, 2021).\nOther costs/(income)\nThe table below includes the other costs/(income) in our consolidated statements of income, as well as key associated metrics, for the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021:\nSG&A expense\nprimarily includes sales force compensation, information technology costs, third party professional fees, management salaries, bad debt expense and clerical and administrative overhead. The increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to higher bonus and stock compensation expenses, which reflect improved profitability.\nThe\nmerger related costs\nprimarily reflect transaction costs associated with the General Finance acquisition that was completed in May 2021, as discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. We have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions, each of which had annual revenues of over $200 prior to acquisition, that significantly impact our operations.\nThe\nrestructuring charges\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 primarily reflect severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. See note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nNon-rental depreciation and amortization\nincludes (i) the amortization of other intangible assets and (ii) depreciation expense associated with equipment that is not offered for rent (such as computers and office equipment) and amortization expense associated with leasehold improvements. Our other intangible assets consist of customer relationships, non-compete agreements and trade names and associated trademarks.\nInterest expense, net\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included aggregate debt redemption losses of $30 and $183, respectively. The debt redemption losses reflect the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes. Excluding the impact of these losses, interest expense, net for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 18.9 percent year-over-year primarily due to decreases in average debt and the average cost of debt.\nOther expense (income), net\nprimarily includes (i) currency gains and losses, (ii) finance charges, (iii) gains and losses on sales of non-rental equipment and (iv) other miscellaneous items.\nA detailed reconciliation of the\neffective tax rates\nto the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate is included in note 15 to our consolidated financial statements. The effective income tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year-over-year primarily due to the release in 2020 of a valuation allowance on foreign tax credits.\n37\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations, technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property and deferral of employer payroll taxes. The CARES Act did not materially impact our effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we have deferred employer payroll taxes of $27 under the CARES Act, all of which is due in 2022.\nBalance sheet\n. Accounts receivable, net increased by $362, or 27.5 percent, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 primarily due to increased revenue. Prepaid expenses and other assets decreased by $209, or 55.7 percent, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, primarily due to refundable deposits on expected purchases, primarily of rental equipment, pursuant to advanced purchase agreements, as discussed further in note 7 to our consolidated financial statements. Rental equipment, net increased by $1.855 billion, or 21.3 percent, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 primarily due to the impact of the General Finance acquisition and increased capital expenditures. As discussed above, capital expenditures were significantly reduced in 2020 due to COVID-19, while capital expenditures in 2021 have exceeded historic (pre-COVID-19) levels. Accounts payable increased by $350, or 75.1 percent, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, primarily due to increased business activity. Accrued expenses and other liabilities increased $161, or 22.4 percent, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021, primarily due to a higher bonus accrual, which reflects increased profitability, and the impact of the General Finance acquisition. See note 11 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on accrued expenses and other liabilities. Deferred taxes increased by $386, or 21.8 percent, from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 primarily due to the impact of the General Finance acquisition and increased capital expenditures. See note 15 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail on deferred taxes.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources.\nWe manage our liquidity using internal cash management practices, which are subject to (i) the policies and cooperation of the financial institutions we utilize to maintain and provide cash management services, (ii) the terms and other requirements of the agreements to which we are a party and (iii) the statutes, regulations and practices of each of the local jurisdictions in which we operate. See \"Financial Overview\" above for a summary of the 2021 capital structure actions taken to improve our financial flexibility and liquidity.\nSince 2012, we have repurchased a total of $3.7 billion of Holdings' common stock under five completed share repurchase programs. On January 28, 2020, our Board of Directors authorized a $500 share repurchase program, which commenced in the first quarter of 2020 and was intended to run for 12 months. Through March 2020, when the program was paused due to the COVID-19 pandemic, we repurchased $257 of common stock under the program. On January 25, 2022, our Board authorized a $1 billion share repurchase program, which is expected to commence in the first quarter of 2022 and be completed in 2022. This program replaces the prior $500 program.\nOur principal existing sources of cash are cash generated from operations and from the sale of rental equipment, and borrowings available under our ABL and accounts receivable securitization facilities. As of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $144. Cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated A or better. We believe that our existing sources of cash will be sufficient to support our existing operations over the next 12 months. The table below presents financial information associated with our principal sources of cash as of and for the year December 31, 2021:\n___________________\n38\n(1)\nThe maximum outstanding debt under the ABL facility exceeded the average outstanding debt primarily due to the use of borrowings under the ABL facility to fund most of the cost of the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n(2)\nAs discussed in note 13 to the consolidated financial statements, the accounts receivable securitization facility expires on June 24, 2022 and may be further extended on a 364-day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility.\nWe expect that our principal short-term (over the next 12 months) and long-term needs for cash relating to our operations will be to fund (i) operating activities and working capital, (ii) the purchase of rental equipment and inventory items offered for sale, (iii) payments due under operating leases, (iv) debt service, (v) share repurchases and (vi) acquisitions. We plan to fund such cash requirements from our existing sources of cash. In addition, we may seek additional financing through the securitization of some of our real estate, the use of additional operating leases or other financing sources as market conditions permit. The table below presents information on payments coming due under the most significant categories of our needs for cash (excluding operating cash flows pertaining to normal business operations, such as human capital costs, which are not accurately estimable) as of December 31, 2021:\n_________________\n(1)    The payments due with respect to a period represent (i) in the case of debt and finance leases, the scheduled principal payments due in such period, and (ii) in the case of operating leases, the payments due in such period for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more. See note 13 to the consolidated financial statements for further debt information, and note 14 for further finance lease and operating lease information.\n(2)    Estimated interest payments have been calculated based on the principal amount of debt and the applicable interest rates as of December 31, 2021.\n(3)    As of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding advance purchase orders, which were negotiated in the ordinary course of business, with our equipment and inventory suppliers. These purchase orders can generally be cancelled by us without cancellation penalties. The equipment and inventory receipts from the suppliers pursuant to these purchase orders and the related payments to the suppliers are expected to be completed throughout 2022 and 2023.\nThe amount of our future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including general economic conditions and growth prospects. We expect that we will fund such expenditures from cash generated from operations, proceeds from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment and, if required, borrowings available under the ABL facility and accounts receivable securitization facility. Net rental capital expenditures (defined as purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment) were $2.030 billion and $103 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. As discussed above, disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our COVID-19 response plan, which contributed to net rental capital expenditures in 2020 that were significantly below historic levels.\nTo access the capital markets, we rely on credit rating agencies to assign ratings to our securities as an indicator of credit quality. Lower credit ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs and reduced access to debt capital markets. Credit ratings also affect the costs of derivative transactions, including interest rate and foreign currency derivative transactions. As a result, negative changes in our credit ratings could adversely impact our costs of funding. Our credit ratings as of January 24, 2022 were as follows:\nA security rating is not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities. There is no assurance that any rating will remain in effect for a given period of time or that any rating will not be revised or withdrawn by a rating agency in the future.\nLoan Covenants and Compliance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the senior notes. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\n39\nThe only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below 10 percent of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of December 31, 2021, specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility.\nURNA’s payment capacity is restricted under the covenants in the ABL and term loan facilities and the indentures governing its outstanding indebtedness. Although this restricted capacity limits our ability to move operating cash flows to Holdings, because of certain intercompany arrangements, we do not expect any material adverse impact on Holdings’ ability to meet its cash obligations.\nSources and Uses of Cash\n. During 2021, we (i) generated cash from operating activities of $3.689 billion and (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $998. We used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment and intangible assets of $3.198 billion, (ii) purchase other companies for $1.436 billion and (iii) make debt payments, net of proceeds, of $98. During 2020, we (i) generated cash from operating activities of $2.658 billion, which included $300 of cash outflow for refundable deposits on expected rental equipment purchases, as discussed further in note 7 to the consolidated financial statements, and (ii) generated cash from the sale of rental and non-rental equipment of $900. We used cash during this period principally to (i) purchase rental and non-rental equipment of $1.158 billion, (ii) make debt payments, net of proceeds, of $1.985 billion and (iii) purchase shares of our common stock for $286.\nFree Cash Flow GAAP Reconciliation\nWe define “free cash flow” as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of, and plus proceeds from, equipment and intangible assets. The equipment and intangible asset purchases and proceeds are included in cash flows from investing activities. Management believes that free cash flow provides useful additional information concerning cash flow available to meet future debt service obligations and working capital requirements. However, free cash flow is not a measure of financial performance or liquidity under GAAP. Accordingly, free cash flow should not be considered an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as an indicator of operating performance or liquidity. The table below provides a reconciliation between net cash provided by operating activities and free cash flow.\nFree cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1.514 billion, a decrease of $926 as compared to $2.440 billion for the year ended December 31, 2020. Free cash flow decreased primarily due to increased net rental capital expenditures (purchases of rental equipment less the proceeds from sales of rental equipment), partially offset by increased net cash provided by operating activities. Net rental capital expenditures increased $1.927 billion, or 1,871 percent, year-over-year. As discussed above, disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our COVID-19 response plan, which contributed to net rental capital expenditures in 2020 that were significantly below historic (pre-COVID-19) levels, while capital expenditures in 2021 have exceeded historic levels.\nRelationship between Holdings and URNA\n. Holdings is principally a holding company and primarily conducts its operations through its wholly owned subsidiary, URNA, and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings licenses its tradename and other intangibles and provides certain services to URNA in connection with its operations. These services principally include: (i) senior management services; (ii) finance and tax-related services and support; (iii) information technology systems and\n40\nsupport; (iv) acquisition-related services; (v) legal services; and (vi) human resource support. In addition, Holdings leases certain equipment and real property that are made available for use by URNA and its subsidiaries.\nInformation Regarding Guarantors of URNA Indebtedness\nURNA is 100 percent owned by Holdings and has certain outstanding indebtedness that is guaranteed by both Holdings and, with the exception of its U.S. special purpose vehicle which holds receivable assets relating to the Company’s accounts receivable securitization facility (the “SPV”), captive insurance subsidiaries and immaterial subsidiaries acquired in connection with the General Finance acquisition, all of URNA’s U.S. subsidiaries (the “guarantor subsidiaries”). Other than the guarantee by our Canadian subsidiary of URNA's indebtedness under the ABL facility, none of URNA’s indebtedness is guaranteed by URNA's foreign subsidiaries, the SPV, captive insurance subsidiaries or immaterial subsidiaries acquired in connection with the General Finance acquisition (together, the “non-guarantor subsidiaries”). The receivable assets owned by the SPV have been sold or contributed by URNA to the SPV and are not available to satisfy the obligations of URNA or Holdings’ other subsidiaries. Holdings consolidates each of URNA and the guarantor subsidiaries in its consolidated financial statements. URNA and the guarantor subsidiaries are all 100 percent-owned and controlled by Holdings. Holdings’ guarantees of URNA’s indebtedness are full and unconditional, except that the guarantees may be automatically released and relieved upon satisfaction of the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met. The Holdings guarantees are also subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by Holdings will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws.\nThe guarantees of Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries are made on a joint and several basis. The guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are not full and unconditional because a guarantor subsidiary can be automatically released and relieved of its obligations under certain circumstances, including sale of the guarantor subsidiary, the sale of all or substantially all of the guarantor subsidiary's assets, the requirements for legal defeasance or covenant defeasance under the applicable indenture being met, designating the guarantor subsidiary as an unrestricted subsidiary for purposes of the applicable covenants or the notes being rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA. Like the Holdings guarantees, the guarantees of the guarantor subsidiaries are subject to subordination provisions (to the same extent that the obligations of the issuer under the relevant notes are subordinated to other debt of the issuer) and to a standard limitation which provides that the maximum amount guaranteed by each guarantor will not exceed the maximum amount that can be guaranteed without making the guarantee void under fraudulent conveyance laws.\nAll of the existing guarantees by Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries rank equally in right of payment with all of the guarantors' existing and future senior indebtedness. The secured indebtedness of Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries (including guarantees of URNA’s existing and future secured indebtedness) will rank effectively senior to guarantees of any unsecured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness. Future guarantees of subordinated indebtedness will rank junior to any existing and future senior indebtedness of the guarantors. The guarantees of URNA’s indebtedness are effectively junior to any indebtedness of our subsidiaries that are not guarantors, including our foreign subsidiaries. As of December 31, 2021, indebtedness of our non-guarantors included (i) $843 of outstanding borrowings by the SPV in connection with the Company’s accounts receivable securitization facility, (ii) $141 of outstanding borrowings under the ABL facility by non-guarantor subsidiaries and (iii) $9 of finance leases of our non-guarantor subsidiaries.\nCovenants in the ABL facility, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities, and the other agreements governing our debt, impose operating and financial restrictions on URNA, Holdings and the guarantor subsidiaries, including limitations on the ability to make share repurchases and dividend payments. As of December 31, 2021, the amount available for distribution under the most restrictive of these covenants was $1.602 billion. The Company’s total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments includes the intercompany receivable balance of Holdings. As of December 31, 2021, our total available capacity for making share repurchases and dividend payments, which includes URNA’s capacity to make restricted payments and the intercompany receivable balance of Holdings, was $5.396 billion.\nBased on our understanding of Rule 3-10 of Regulation S-X (\"Rule 3-10\"), we believe that Holdings’ guarantees of URNA indebtedness comply with the conditions set forth in Rule 3-10, which enable us to present summarized financial information for Holdings, URNA and the consolidated guarantor subsidiaries in accordance with Rule 13-01 of Regulation S-X. The summarized financial information excludes information regarding the non-guarantor subsidiaries. In accordance with Rule 3-10, separate financial statements of the guarantor subsidiaries have not been presented.\nThe summarized financial information of Holdings, URNA and the guarantor subsidiaries on a combined basis is as follows:\n41"

    "text": "Our exposure to market risk primarily consists of (i) interest rate risk associated with our variable and fixed rate debt and (ii) foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign operations.\nInterest Rate Risk\n. As of December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $2.8 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates, comprised of borrowings under the ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities. See note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for the amounts outstanding, and the interest rates thereon, as of December 31, 2021 under these facilities. As of December 31, 2021, based upon the amount of our variable rate debt outstanding, our annual after-tax earnings would decrease by approximately $21 for each one percentage point increase in the interest rates applicable to our variable rate debt.\nThe amount of variable rate indebtedness outstanding may fluctuate significantly. For additional information concerning the terms of our variable rate debt, see note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate of $6.9 billion of indebtedness that bears interest at fixed rates. A one percentage point decrease in market interest rates as of December 31, 2021 would increase the fair value of our fixed rate indebtedness by approximately six percent. For additional information concerning the fair value and terms of our fixed rate debt, see note 12 (see “Fair Value of Financial Instruments”) and note 13 to our consolidated financial statements.\nCurrency Exchange Risk\n.\nWe primarily operate in the U.S. and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our foreign subsidiaries accounted for $955, or 10 percent, of our total revenue of $9.716 billion, and $134, or 7 percent, of our total pretax income of $1.846 billion. Based on the size of our foreign operations relative to the Company as a whole, we do not believe that a 10 percent change in exchange rates would have a material impact on our earnings. We do not engage in purchasing forward exchange contracts for speculative purposes.\n42"

    "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of United Rentals, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of United Rentals, Inc. (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n43\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

(\"Holdings\") is principally a holding company and conducts its operations primarily through its wholly owned subsidiary, United Rentals (North America), Inc. (“URNA”), and subsidiaries of URNA. Holdings’ primary asset is its sole ownership of all issued and outstanding shares of common stock of URNA. URNA’s various credit agreements and debt instruments place restrictions on its ability to transfer funds to its stockholder. As used in this report, the terms the “Company,” “United Rentals,” “we,” “us,” and “our” refer to United Rentals, Inc. and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated.\nWe rent equipment to a diverse customer base that includes construction and industrial companies, manufacturers, utilities, municipalities, homeowners and government entities. We primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of BakerCorp International Holdings, Inc. (“BakerCorp”), which allowed for our entry into select European markets. As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance Corporation (“General Finance”), which allowed for our entry into select markets in Australia and New Zealand. In addition to renting equipment, we sell new and used rental equipment, as well as related contractor supplies, parts and service.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include our accounts and those of our controlled subsidiary companies. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. We consolidate variable interest entities if we are deemed the primary beneficiary of the entity.\nCOVID-19\nThe novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was first identified in people in late 2019. COVID-19 spread rapidly throughout the world and, in March 2020, the World Health Organization characterized COVID-19 as a pandemic. COVID-19 is a pandemic of respiratory disease spreading from person-to-person that poses a serious public health risk. The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. Uncertainty remains regarding the ongoing impact of existing and emerging variant strains of COVID-19 on the operations and financial position of United Rentals, and on the global economy. Uncertainty also remains regarding the length of time it will take for the COVID-19 pandemic to ultimately subside, which will be impacted by the effectiveness of vaccines against COVID-19 (including against emerging variant strains), and by measures that may in the future be implemented to protect public health. See \"Item 1. Business-Industry Overview and Economic Outlook\" for a discussion of market performance in 2021 and 2020. The health and safety of our employees and customers remains our top priority, and we also implemented a detailed COVID-19 response plan, which is explained in more detail in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” and which we believe helped mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our results.\nWe began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, when rental volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021, and we have seen recent evidence of recovery across our construction and industrial markets, as well as encouraging gains in end-market indicators, as reflected in our 2022 forecast. COVID-19 is discussed in more detail throughout “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nCash Equivalents\nWe consider all highly liquid instruments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consist of direct obligations of financial institutions rated A or better.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nWe maintain allowances for doubtful accounts. These allowances reflect our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances. Trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written-off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes. Write-offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds.\nSee note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail.\n52\nInventory\nInventory consists of new equipment, contractor supplies, tools, parts, fuel and related supply items. Inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is determined, depending on the type of inventory, using either a specific identification, weighted-average or first-in, first-out method.\nRental Equipment\nRental equipment, which includes service and delivery vehicles, is recorded at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful life of the equipment using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for rental equipment is\ntwo\nto\n20\nyears. Rental equipment is depreciated to a salvage value of\nzero\nto\n50\npercent of cost. The weighted average salvage value of our rental equipment is\n11\npercent of cost. Rental equipment is depreciated whether or not it is out on rent.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The range of estimated useful lives for property and equipment is\ntwo\nto\n39\nyears. Ordinary repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. Leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives or the remaining life of the lease, whichever is shorter.\nAcquisition Accounting\nWe have made a number of acquisitions in the past and may continue to make acquisitions in the future. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded based on their respective fair values at the date of acquisition. Long-lived assets (principally rental equipment), goodwill and other intangible assets generally represent the largest components of our acquisitions. Rental equipment is valued utilizing either a cost, market or income approach, or a combination of certain of these methods, depending on the asset being valued and the availability of market or income data. The intangible assets that we have acquired are non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks. The estimated fair values of these intangible assets reflect various assumptions about discount rates, revenue growth rates, operating margins, terminal values, useful lives and other prospective financial information. Goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of the acquired business over the net of the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks are valued based on an excess earnings or income approach based on projected cash flows.\nDetermining the fair value of the assets and liabilities acquired can be judgmental in nature and can involve the use of significant estimates and assumptions. The judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to the assets acquired, as well as the estimated life of the assets, can materially impact net income in periods subsequent to the acquisition through depreciation and amortization, and in certain instances through impairment charges, if the asset becomes impaired in the future. As discussed below, we regularly review for impairments.\nWhen we make an acquisition, we also acquire other assets and assume liabilities. These other assets and liabilities typically include, but are not limited to, parts inventory, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other working capital items. Because of their short-term nature, the fair values of these other assets and liabilities generally approximate the book values on the acquired entities' balance sheets.\nEvaluation of Goodwill Impairment\nGoodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that an impairment loss may have been incurred. Application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including: the identification of reporting units; assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units; assignment of goodwill to reporting units; determination of the fair value of each reporting unit; and an assumption as to the form of the transaction in which the reporting unit would be acquired by a market participant (either a taxable or nontaxable transaction).\nWhen conducting the goodwill impairment test, we are required to compare the fair value of our reporting units (which are our regions) with the carrying amount. As discussed in note 5 to our consolidated financial statements, as of December 31, 2021, our divisions were our operating segments. We conducted the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2021 at the reporting unit level, which is one level below the operating segment level. We conducted the goodwill impairment test as of October 1, 2020 at the same reporting unit level, although at that time, the reporting unit was also the operating segment (see note 5 for further discussion of our segment structure).\nFinancial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") guidance permits entities to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We estimate the fair\n53\nvalue of our reporting units using a combination of an income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows and a market approach based on market price data of shares of our Company and other corporations engaged in similar businesses as well as acquisition multiples paid in recent transactions. We believe this approach, which utilizes multiple valuation techniques, yields the most appropriate evidence of fair value.\nIn connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of October 1, 2021, we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and quantitatively compared the fair values of our reporting units with their carrying amounts. Our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least\n59\npercent. As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance. All of the assets in the Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units were acquired in the General Finance acquisition. The estimated fair values of our Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units exceeded their carrying amounts by\n10\npercent and\n17\npercent, respectively. As all of the assets in the Mobile Storage and Mobile Storage International reporting units were recorded at fair value as of the May 2021 acquisition date, we expected the percentages by which the fair values for these reporting units exceeded the carrying values to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units.\nIn connection with our goodwill impairment test that was conducted as of October 1, 2020, we bypassed the optional qualitative assessment for each reporting unit and proceeded directly to the first step of the goodwill impairment test. We considered the impact of COVID-19 when performing the test, and it did not have a material impact on the test results. Our goodwill impairment testing as of this date indicated that all of our reporting units, excluding our Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit, had estimated fair values which exceeded their respective carrying amounts by at least\n42\npercent. As discussed above, in July 2018, we completed the acquisition of BakerCorp. All of the assets in the Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit were acquired in the BakerCorp acquisition. The estimated fair value of our Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount by\n22\npercent. As all of the assets in the Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit were recorded at fair value as of the July 2018 acquisition date, we expected the percentage by which the Fluid Solutions Europe reporting unit’s fair value exceeded its carrying value to be significantly less than the equivalent percentages determined for our other reporting units.\nRestructuring Charges\nCosts associated with exit or disposal activities, including lease termination costs and certain employee severance costs associated with restructuring, branch closings or other activities, are recognized at fair value when they are incurred.\nOther Intangible Assets\nOther intangible assets consist of non-compete agreements, customer relationships and trade names and associated trademarks. The non-compete agreements are being amortized on a straight-line basis over initial periods of approximately\n5\nyears. The customer relationships are being amortized either using the sum of the years' digits method or on a straight-line basis over initial periods ranging from\n5\nto\n15\nyears. The trade names and associated trademarks are being amortized using the sum of the years' digits method over initial periods of approximately\n5\nyears. We believe that the amortization methods used reflect the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed.\nLong-Lived Assets\nLong-lived assets are recorded at the lower of amortized cost or fair value. As part of an ongoing review of the valuation of long-lived assets, we assess the carrying value of such assets if facts and circumstances suggest they may be impaired. If this review indicates the carrying value of such an asset may not be recoverable, as determined by an undiscounted cash flow analysis over the remaining useful life, the carrying value would be reduced to its estimated fair value.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency\nAssets and liabilities of our foreign subsidiaries that have a functional currency other than U.S. dollars are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates at the balance sheet date. Revenues and expenses are translated at average exchange rates effective during the year. Foreign currency translation gains and losses are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income within stockholders’ equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nAs discussed in note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, we recognize revenue in accordance with two different accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 (which addresses revenue from contracts with customers) and 2) Topic 842 (which\n54\naddresses lease revenue). As discussed in note 3, most of our revenue is accounted for under Topic 842. The discussion below addresses our primary revenue types based on the accounting standard used to determine the accounting.\nLease revenues (Topic 842)\nThe accounting for the significant types of revenue that are accounted for under Topic 842 is discussed below.\nOwned equipment rentals:\nOwned equipment rentals represent revenues from renting equipment that we own. We account for such rentals as operating leases.\nRe-rent revenue:\nRe-rent revenue reflects revenues from equipment that we rent from vendors and then rent to our customers. We account for such rentals as subleases. The accounting for re-rent revenue is the same as the accounting for owned equipment rentals described above.\nRevenues from contracts with customers (Topic 606)\nThe accounting for the significant types of revenue that are accounted for under Topic 606 is discussed below.\nDelivery and pick-up:\nDelivery and pick-up revenue associated with renting equipment is recognized when the service is performed.\nSales of rental equipment, new equipment and contractor supplies\nare recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer and when collectibility is probable.\nService and other revenues\nprimarily represent revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet (including parts sales). Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nSee note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our revenue accounting.\nDelivery Expense\nEquipment rentals include our revenues from fees we charge for equipment delivery. Delivery costs are charged to operations as incurred, and are included in cost of revenues on our consolidated statements of income.\nAdvertising Expense\nWe promote our business through local and national advertising in various media, including television, trade publications, branded sponsorships, yellow pages, the internet, radio and direct mail. Advertising costs are generally expensed as incurred. These costs may include the development costs for branded content and advertising campaigns. Advertising expense, net of the qualified advertising reimbursements discussed below, was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nWe receive reimbursements for advertising that promotes a vendor’s products or services. Such reimbursements that meet the applicable criteria under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) are offset against advertising costs in the period in which we recognize the incremental advertising cost.\nThe amounts of qualified advertising reimbursements that reduced advertising expense were $\n49\n, $\n22\nand $\n49\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInsurance\nWe are insured for general liability, workers’ compensation and automobile liability, subject to deductibles or self-insured retentions per occurrence. Losses within the deductible amounts are accrued based upon the aggregate liability for reported claims incurred, as well as an estimated liability for claims incurred but not yet reported. These liabilities are not discounted. We are also self-insured for group medical claims but purchase “stop loss” insurance as protection against any one significant loss.\nIncome Taxes\nWe use the liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. Recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely than not to be realized in future periods. The most significant positive evidence that we consider in the recognition of deferred tax assets is the expected reversal of cumulative deferred tax liabilities resulting from book versus tax depreciation of our rental equipment fleet that is well in excess of the deferred tax assets.\n55\nWe use a two-step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return regarding uncertainties in income tax positions. The first step is recognition: we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. In evaluating whether a tax position has met the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority with full knowledge of all relevant information. The second step is measurement: a tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements. The tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements will generally result in one or more of the following: an increase in a liability for income taxes payable, a reduction of an income tax refund receivable, a reduction in a deferred tax asset or an increase in a deferred tax liability.\nWe have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no taxes were provided on such earnings prior to the fourth quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs, and determined that such cash could no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result, our prior assertion that all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries should be considered indefinitely reinvested changed. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified additional cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs, and remitted $\n203\nof cash from foreign operations (such amount represents the cumulative amount of identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs). The taxes recorded associated with the remitted cash were immaterial in both 2020 and 2021.\nWe continue to expect that the remaining balance of our undistributed foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. If we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Significant estimates impact the calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts, depreciation and amortization, income taxes and reserves for claims. Actual results could materially differ from those estimates.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to significant concentrations of credit risk include cash and cash equivalents and accounts receivable. We maintain cash and cash equivalents with high quality financial institutions. Concentration of credit risk with respect to receivables is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers makes up our customer base (see note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for further detail). We manage credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and other monitoring procedures.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe measure stock-based compensation at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and recognize stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value of stock option awards requires judgment, including estimating stock price volatility and expected option life. Restricted stock awards are valued based on the fair value of the stock on the grant date and the related compensation expense is recognized over the service period. Similarly, for time-based restricted stock awards subject to graded vesting, we recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period. For performance-based restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), compensation expense is recognized if satisfaction of the performance condition is considered probable. We recognize forfeitures of stock-based compensation as they occur.\nAccounting/Disclosure Guidance Adopted in 2021\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued guidance intended to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance removes the following exceptions: 1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation when there is a loss from continuing operations and income or a gain from other items, 2) exception to the requirement to recognize a deferred tax liability for equity method investments when a foreign subsidiary becomes an equity method investment, 3) exception to the ability not to recognize a deferred tax liability for a foreign subsidiary when a foreign equity method investment becomes a subsidiary and 4) exception to the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. Additionally, the guidance simplifies the accounting for income taxes by: 1) requiring that an entity recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and account for any incremental amount incurred as a non-income-based tax, 2) requiring that an entity evaluate when a step up in the tax basis of goodwill should be considered part of the business combination in which\n56\nthe book goodwill was originally recognized and when it should be considered a separate transaction, 3) specifying that an entity is not required to allocate the consolidated amount of current and deferred tax expense to a legal entity that is not subject to tax in its separate financial statements (although the entity may elect to do so (on an entity-by-entity basis) for a legal entity that is both not subject to tax and disregarded by the taxing authority), 4) requiring that an entity reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in the annual effective tax rate computation in the interim period that includes the enactment date and 5) making minor improvements for income tax accounting related to employee stock ownership plans and investments in qualified affordable housing projects accounted for using the equity method. Different components of the guidance required retrospective, modified retrospective or prospective adoption. We adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2021, and the impact on our financial statements was not material.\nAmendments to Management's Discussion and Analysis, Selected Financial Data, and Supplementary Financial Information\n. In February 2021, a Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") rule intended to modernize, simplify, and enhance certain financial disclosure requirements became effective. We have adopted this rule in this Form 10-K, and the impact on our financial statements was not material, although several disclosures were updated. The primary disclosure changes we made associated with this rule were to remove: 1) discussions comparing 2020 and 2019 results, as such disclosures were included in our prior SEC filings, 2) selected financial data for the preceding five years and 3) the tabular disclosure of contractual obligations, although we continue to provide disclosures addressing the most significant categories of our short-term and long-term needs for cash.\n3.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue Recognition Accounting Standards\nWe recognize revenue in accordance with two different accounting standards: 1) Topic 606 (which addresses revenue from contracts with customers) and 2) Topic 842 (which addresses lease revenue). Under Topic 606, revenue from contracts with customers is measured based on the consideration specified in the contract with the customer, and excludes any sales incentives and amounts collected on behalf of third parties. A performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to a customer, and is the unit of account under Topic 606. As reflected below, most of our revenue is accounted for under Topic 842. Our contracts with customers generally do not include multiple performance obligations. We recognize revenue when we satisfy a performance obligation by transferring control over a product or service to a customer. The amount of revenue recognized reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for such products or services.\nNature of goods and services\nIn the following table, revenue is summarized by type and by the applicable accounting standard.\nRevenues by reportable segment and geographical market are presented in note 5 of the consolidated financial statements using the revenue captions reflected in our consolidated statements of operations. The majority of our revenue is recognized in\n57\nour general rentals segment and in the U.S. (for the year ended December 31, 2021,\n76\npercent and\n90\npercent, respectively). We believe that the disaggregation of our revenue from contracts to customers as reflected above, coupled with the further discussion below and the reportable segment and geographical market disclosures in note 5, depicts how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nLease revenues (Topic 842)\nThe accounting for the types of revenue that are accounted for under Topic 842 is discussed below.\nOwned equipment rentals represent our most significant revenue type (they accounted for\n70\npercent of total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021) and are governed by our standard rental contract. We account for such rentals as operating leases. The lease terms are included in our contracts, and the determination of whether our contracts contain leases generally does not require significant assumptions or judgments. Our lease revenues do not include material amounts of variable payments.\nOwned equipment rentals:\nOwned equipment rentals represent revenues from renting equipment that we own. We do not generally provide an option for the lessee to purchase the rented equipment at the end of the lease, and do not generate material revenue from sales of equipment under such options.\nWe recognize revenues from renting equipment on a straight-line basis. Our rental contract periods are hourly, daily, weekly or monthly. By way of example, if a customer were to rent a piece of equipment and the daily, weekly and monthly rental rates for that particular piece were (in actual dollars) $100, $300 and $900, respectively, we would recognize revenue of $32.14 per day. The daily rate for recognition purposes is calculated by dividing the monthly rate of $900 by the monthly term of 28 days. This daily rate assumes that the equipment will be on rent for the full 28 days, as we are unsure of when the customer will return the equipment and therefore unsure of which rental contract period will apply.\nAs part of this straight-line methodology, when the equipment is returned, we recognize as incremental revenue the excess, if any, between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, which is based on the rental contract period applicable to the actual number of days the equipment was out on rent, over the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date. In any given accounting period, we will have customers return equipment and be contractually required to pay us more than the cumulative amount of revenue recognized to date under the straight-line methodology. For instance, continuing the above example, if the customer rented the above piece of equipment on December 29 and returned it at the close of business on January 1, we would recognize incremental revenue on January 1 of $171.44 (in actual dollars, representing the difference between the amount the customer is contractually required to pay, or $300 at the weekly rate, and the cumulative amount recognized to date on a straight-line basis, or $128.56, which represents four days at $32.14 per day).\nWe record amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue as deferred revenue on our balance sheet. We had deferred revenue (associated with both Topic 842 and Topic 606) of $\n83\nand $\n51\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in 2021 primarily reflects the impact of the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nAs noted above, we are unsure of when the customer will return rented equipment. As such, we do not know how much the customer will owe us upon return of the equipment and cannot provide a maturity analysis of future lease payments. Our equipment is generally rented for short periods of time (significantly less than a year). Lessees do not provide residual value guarantees on rented equipment.\nWe expect to derive significant future benefits from our equipment following the end of the rental term. Our rentals are generally short-term in nature, and our equipment is typically rented for the majority of the time that we own it. We additionally recognize revenue from sales of rental equipment when we dispose of the equipment.\nRe-rent revenue:\nRe-rent revenue reflects revenues from equipment that we rent from vendors and then rent to our customers. We account for such rentals as subleases. The accounting for re-rent revenue is the same as the accounting for owned equipment rentals described above.\n“Other”\nequipment rental revenue is primarily comprised of 1) Rental Protection Plan (or \"RPP\") revenue associated with the damage waiver customers can purchase when they rent our equipment to protect against potential loss or damage, 2) environmental charges associated with the rental of equipment, 3) charges for rented equipment that is damaged by our customers and 4) charges for setup and other services performed on rented equipment.\nRevenues from contracts with customers (Topic 606)\n58\nThe accounting for the types of revenue that are accounted for under Topic 606 is discussed below. Substantially all of our revenues under Topic 606 are recognized at a point-in-time rather than over time.\nDelivery and pick-up:\nDelivery and pick-up revenue associated with renting equipment is recognized when the service is performed.\n“Other”\nequipment rental revenue is primarily comprised of revenues associated with the consumption of fuel by our customers which are recognized when the equipment is returned by the customer (and consumption, if any, can be measured).\nSales of rental equipment, new equipment and contractor supplies\nare recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer and when collectibility is probable.\nService and other revenues\nprimarily represent revenues earned from providing repair and maintenance services on our customers’ fleet (including parts sales). Service revenue is recognized as the services are performed.\nReceivables and contract assets and liabilities\nAs reflected above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for under Topic 842 (such revenue represented\n77\npercent of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021). The customers that are responsible for the remaining revenue that is accounted for under Topic 606 are generally the same customers that rent our equipment. We manage credit risk associated with our accounts receivables at the customer level. Because the same customers generate the revenues that are accounted for under both Topic 606 and Topic 842, the discussions below on credit risk and our allowances for doubtful accounts address receivables arising from revenues from both Topic 606 and Topic 842.\nConcentration of credit risk with respect to our receivables is limited because a large number of geographically diverse customers makes up our customer base. Our largest customer accounted for less than\none\npercent of total revenues in each of 2021, 2020, and 2019. Our customer with the largest receivable balance represented approximately\none\npercent and\ntwo\npercent of total receivables at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We manage credit risk through credit approvals, credit limits and other monitoring procedures.\nOur allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our estimate of the amount of our receivables that we will be unable to collect based on historical write-off experience and, as applicable, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Our estimate could require change based on changing circumstances, including changes in the economy or in the particular circumstances of individual customers. Accordingly, we may be required to increase or decrease our allowances. Trade receivables that have contractual maturities of one year or less are written-off when they are determined to be uncollectible based on the criteria necessary to qualify as a deduction for federal tax purposes. Write-offs of such receivables require management approval based on specified dollar thresholds. See the table below for a rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts.\nIn 2020, we adopted accounting guidance that requires companies to present certain financial assets net of the amount expected to be collected. Adoption of this guidance did not materially impact our financial statements. The measurement of expected credit losses is based on relevant information from past events, including historical experiences, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect collectibility. Trade receivables are the only material financial asset we have that is subject to the requirement to measure expected credit losses as noted above, as this requirement does not apply to receivables arising from operating lease revenues. Substantially all of our non-lease trade receivables are due in one year or less. As discussed above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for as lease revenue (such revenue represented\n77\npercent of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021), and these revenues account for corresponding portions of the $\n1.677\nbillion of net accounts receivable and the associated allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n112\nreported on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021.\nAs discussed above, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for under Topic 842. The customers that are responsible for the remaining revenue that is accounted for under Topic 606 are generally the same customers that rent our equipment. We manage credit risk associated with our accounts receivables at the customer level.\nThe rollforward of our allowance for doubtful accounts (in total, and associated with revenues arising from both Topic 606 and Topic 842) is shown\n59\nbelow.\n_________________\n(1)    Reflects bad debt expenses recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses (associated with Topic 606 revenues).\n(2)    Primarily reflects doubtful accounts associated with lease revenues that were recognized as a reduction to equipment rentals revenue (primarily associated with Topic 842 revenues).\n(3)    Primarily represents write-offs of accounts, net of immaterial recoveries and other activity.\nWe do\nno\nt have material contract assets, or impairment losses associated therewith, or material contract liabilities, associated with contracts with customers. Our contracts with customers do not generally result in material amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue. We did\nno\nt recognize material revenue during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 that was included in the contract liability balance as of the beginning of such periods.\nPerformance obligations\nMost of our Topic 606 revenue is recognized at a point-in-time, rather than over time. Accordingly, in any particular period, we do not generally recognize a significant amount of revenue from performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in previous periods, and the amounts of such revenue recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were\nno\nt material. We also do not expect to recognize material revenue in the future related to performance obligations that were unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) as of December 31, 2021.\nPayment terms\nOur Topic 606 revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration. Our payment terms vary by the type and location of our customer and the products or services offered. The time between invoicing and when payment is due is not significant. Our contracts do not generally include a significant financing component. For certain products or services and customer types, we require payment before the products or services are delivered to the customer. Our contracts with customers do not generally result in significant obligations associated with returns, refunds or warranties. See above for a discussion of how we manage credit risk.\nRevenue is recognized net of taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.\nContract costs\nWe do not recognize any assets associated with the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer (for example, a sales commission) that we expect to recover. Most of our revenue is recognized at a point-in-time or over a period of one year or less, and we use the practical expedient that allows us to recognize the incremental costs of obtaining a contract as an expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset that we otherwise would have recognized is one year or less.\nContract estimates and judgments\nOur revenues accounted for under Topic 606 generally do not require significant estimates or judgments, primarily for the following reasons:\n•\nThe transaction price is generally fixed and stated in our contracts;\n•\nAs noted above, our contracts generally do not include multiple performance obligations, and accordingly do not generally require estimates of the standalone selling price for each performance obligation;\n•\nOur revenues do not include material amounts of variable consideration, or result in significant obligations associated with returns, refunds or warranties; and\n60\n•\nMost of our revenue is recognized as of a point-in-time and the timing of the satisfaction of the applicable performance obligations is readily determinable. As noted above, our Topic 606 revenue is generally recognized at the time of delivery to, or pick-up by, the customer.\nOur revenues accounted for under Topic 842 also generally do not require significant estimates or judgments. We monitor and review our estimated standalone selling prices on a regular basis.\n4.\nAcquisitions\nOn May 25, 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance. General Finance previously operated as Pac-Van and Container King in the U.S. and Canada, and as Royal Wolf in Australia and New Zealand, and was a leading provider of mobile storage equipment and modular office space. Its network served diverse end-markets, including construction, commercial, industrial, retail, transportation, petrochemical, consumer, natural resources, governmental and education. As of March 31, 2021, General Finance’s rental fleet consisted of approximately\n100,000\nunits at an original cost of approximately $\n650\n. For the 12 months ending December 31, 2020, General Finance had revenues of $\n342\n(such amount represents General Finance’s historic revenue presented in accordance with our revenue mapping). The acquisition is expected to:\n• Complement our leading positions in general construction and industrial rentals and specialty rentals, which will further differentiate us through our ability to deliver value as a one-stop-shop for customers;\n• Create immediate cross-sell opportunities, and allow us to introduce mobile storage and modular office solutions in service areas that previously were not served by General Finance; and\n• Provide entry into Australia and New Zealand, with an established platform run by a seasoned management team, and with a strong growth strategy already in place.\nThe aggregate consideration paid to acquire General Finance was $\n1.032\nbillion. The acquisition and related fees and expenses were funded through available cash and drawings on our senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility (“ABL facility”).\nThe following table summarizes the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The purchase price allocations for these assets and liabilities are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the acquisition measurement period, although we do not expect material future changes.\n(1)\nThe fair value of accounts receivables acquired was $\n44\n, and the gross contractual amount was $\n50\n. We estimated that $\n6\nwould be uncollectible.\n61\n(2)\nThe following table reflects the fair values and useful lives of the acquired intangible assets identified based on our preliminary purchase accounting assessments:\n(3)\nAll of the goodwill was assigned to our specialty segment. We have not yet obtained all the information required to finalize the valuations of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, although we do not expect material future changes. Once finalized, we expect that the goodwill that results from the acquisition will be primarily reflective of General Finance's going-concern value, the value of General Finance's assembled workforce, new customer relationships expected to arise from the acquisition, and operational synergies that we expect to achieve that would not be available to other market participants. $\n28\nof goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 includes General Finance acquisition-related costs which are reflected as “Merger related costs” in our consolidated statements of income. It is not practicable to reasonably estimate the amounts of revenue and earnings of General Finance since the acquisition date, primarily due to the movement of fleet between URI locations and the acquired General Finance locations, as well as our corporate structure and the allocation of corporate costs.\nPro forma financial information\nThe pro forma information below gives effect to the General Finance acquisition as if it had been completed on January 1, 2020 (the \"pro forma acquisition date”). The pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of our results had the acquisition been completed on the above date, nor is it necessarily indicative of our future results. The pro forma information reflects General Finance’s historic revenue presented in accordance with our revenue mapping, does not reflect any cost savings from operating efficiencies or synergies that could result from the acquisition, and also does not reflect additional revenue opportunities following the acquisition. The pro forma information includes adjustments to record the acquired assets and liabilities of General Finance at their respective fair values based on available information and to give effect to the financing for the acquisition. The pro forma adjustments reflected in the table below are subject to change as additional analysis is performed. The purchase price allocations for the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the acquisition measurement period, although we do not expect material future changes. Increases or decreases in the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired may impact our statements of income in future periods. We expect that the values assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed will be finalized during the one-year measurement period following the acquisition date.\nThe table below presents unaudited pro forma consolidated income statement information as if General Finance had been included in our consolidated results for the entire periods reflected:\n62\n________________\n(1) Depreciation of rental equipment and non-rental depreciation were adjusted for the fair value mark-ups, and the changes in useful lives and salvage values, of the equipment acquired in the General Finance acquisition.\n(2) Cost of rental equipment sales was adjusted for the fair value mark-ups of rental equipment acquired in the General Finance acquisition.\n(3) Intangible asset amortization was adjusted to include amortization of the acquired intangible assets.\n(4) The goodwill impairment charge that General Finance recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was eliminated. If the acquisition had occurred as of the pro forma acquisition date, this impairment charge would not have been recognized (instead, we would have tested for goodwill impairment based on the post-acquisition reporting unit structure).\n(5) As discussed above, we funded the General Finance acquisition using drawings on our ABL facility. Interest expense was adjusted to reflect interest on the ABL facility borrowings.\n(6) Historic interest on debt that is not part of the combined entity was eliminated. The adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a debt redemption loss of $\n12\n.\n(7) Merger related costs primarily comprised of financial and legal advisory fees associated with the General Finance acquisition were eliminated as they were assumed to have been recognized prior to the pro forma acquisition date. The adjustment for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes $\n9\nof merger related costs recognized by General Finance prior to the acquisition.\n(8) General Finance historically recognized changes in the valuation of bifurcated derivatives in convertible notes in its statements of operations. These historic changes were eliminated because the bifurcated derivatives are not part of the combined entity.\nIn addition to the General Finance acquisition discussed above, during 2021, we completed a series of acquisitions which were not significant individually or in the aggregate. See the consolidated statements of cash flows for the total cash outflow for purchases of other companies, net of cash acquired, which includes General Finance and the other completed acquisitions, and see note 10 to our consolidated financial statements for a rollforward showing the goodwill acquired associated with these acquisitions. The intangible assets acquired in the General Finance acquisition are discussed above, and $\n66\nof intangible assets were acquired in 2021 associated with the other acquisitions.\n5.\nSegment Information\n63\nOur reportable segments are i) general rentals and ii) specialty (formerly \"trench, power and fluid solutions\"). In the fourth quarter of 2021, following a realignment of certain of our divisions and regions, and changes in leadership roles and responsibilities, we updated our analysis of operating segments and concluded that our divisions now represent our operating segments. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2021, our regions were our operating segments. While this update reflects a change in operating segments, it did not result in any changes to the rental locations in each reportable segment (see Item 2—Properties for detail on the locations in each reportable segment), and, as a result, there were no changes to the historically reported segment financial information.\nAs noted below, we evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit. The primary change resulting from the change in segment presentation is to our ongoing review of segment equipment rentals margins, which we monitor on a quarterly basis to assess margin similarity between operating segments. Because of the change in operating segments, this margin analysis is now conducted at the division level, while it was historically performed at the region level. As discussed further in note 2 to our consolidated financial statements (\"Evaluation of Goodwill Impairment\"), we test for goodwill impairment at the reporting unit (the region, which is one level below the operating segment (division)) level, and the change in the segment structure did not impact our goodwill impairment testing.\nFor general rentals, the divisions discussed below, which are our operating segments, are aggregated into the reportable segment. The specialty segment is a single division that is both an operating segment and a reportable segment. We believe that the divisions that are aggregated into our reportable segments have similar economic characteristics, as each region is capital intensive, offers similar products to similar customers, uses similar methods to distribute its products, and is subject to similar competitive risks. The aggregation of our divisions also reflects the management structure that we use for making operating decisions and assessing performance. We evaluate segment performance primarily based on segment equipment rentals gross profit.\nThe general rentals segment includes the rental of i) general construction and industrial equipment, such as backhoes, skid-steer loaders, forklifts, earthmoving equipment and material handling equipment, ii) aerial work platforms, such as boom lifts and scissor lifts and iii) general tools and light equipment, such as pressure washers, water pumps and power tools. The general rentals segment reflects the aggregation of\nfour\ngeographic divisions— Central, Northeast, Southeast and West—and operates throughout the United States and Canada.\nThe specialty segment, which, as noted above, is a single division that is both an operating segment and a reportable segment, includes the rental of specialty construction products such as i) trench safety equipment, such as trench shields, aluminum hydraulic shoring systems, slide rails, crossing plates, construction lasers and line testing equipment for underground work, ii) power and HVAC equipment, such as portable diesel generators, electrical distribution equipment, and temperature control equipment, iii) fluid solutions equipment primarily used for fluid containment, transfer and treatment, and iv) mobile storage equipment and modular office space. The specialty segment’s customers include construction companies involved in infrastructure projects, municipalities and industrial companies. This segment primarily operates in the United States and Canada, and has a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand.\nThe following table presents the percentage of equipment rental revenue by equipment type for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n________________\n(1)\nAs discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance, which was a leading provider of mobile storage equipment and modular office space. Prior to the General Finance acquisition, we did not rent material amounts of such equipment.\n64\nThe accounting policies for our segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in note 2. Certain corporate costs, including those related to selling, finance, legal, risk management, human resources, corporate management and information technology systems, are deemed to be of an operating nature and are allocated to our segments based primarily on rental fleet size.\nThe following table sets forth financial information by segment as of, and for the years ended, December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nEquipment rentals gross profit is the primary measure management reviews to make operating decisions and assess segment performance.\nThe following is a reconciliation of equipment rentals gross profit to income before provision for income taxes:\n65\n___________________\n(1)\nPrimarily reflects transaction costs associated with the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations. For additional information, see \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-merger related costs\" below.\n(2)\nPrimarily reflects severance and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs. For additional information, see note 6 to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe primarily operate in the United States and Canada, and have a limited presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. In July 2018, we completed the acquisition of BakerCorp, which allowed for our entry into select European markets. As discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements, in May 2021, we completed the acquisition of General Finance, which allowed for our entry into select markets in Australia and New Zealand. Our presence in Europe, Australia and New Zealand is limited, and the foreign information in the table below primarily reflects Canada.\nThe following table presents geographic area information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, except for balance sheet information, which is presented as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n66\n6.\nRestructuring and Asset Impairment Charges\nRestructuring charges primarily include severance costs associated with headcount reductions, as well as branch closure charges. We incur severance costs and branch closure charges in the ordinary course of our business. We only include such costs that are part of a restructuring program as restructuring charges. Since the first such program was initiated in 2008, we have completed\nfive\nrestructuring programs and have incurred total restructuring charges of $\n352\n.\nClosed Restructuring Programs\nOur closed restructuring programs were initiated either in recognition of a challenging economic environment or following the completion of certain significant acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, the total liability associated with the closed restructuring programs was $\n9\n. As of December 31, 2021, we have incurred total restructuring charges under the closed restructuring programs of $\n335\n, comprised of $\n194\nof branch closure charges and $\n141\nof severance and other costs.\n2020-2021 Cost Savings Restructuring Program\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we initiated a restructuring program associated with the consolidation of certain common functions, the relocation of our shared-service facilities and certain other cost reduction measures. We did not recognize material costs associated with this program in 2019, which is excluded from the table below. We closed this program in the first quarter of 2022 and do not expect to expect to recognize significant future costs under the program.\n67\nThe table below provides certain information concerning our restructuring charges under the 2020-2021 Cost Savings restructuring program:\n________________\n(1)    Reflected in our consolidated statements of income as “Restructuring charge” (such charge also includes activity under our other restructuring programs). The restructuring charges are not allocated to our segments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have incurred total restructuring charges under the 2020-2021 Cost Savings restructuring program of $\n17\n, comprised of $\n8\nof branch closure charges and $\n9\nof severance and other costs.\nAsset Impairment Charges\nIn addition to the restructuring charges discussed above, during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded asset impairment charges of $\n14\n, $\n36\nand $\n5\n, respectively, primarily in our general rentals segment. The 2020 asset impairment charges, which were not related to COVID-19, are primarily reflected in depreciation of rental equipment in our consolidated statements of income and principally relate to the discontinuation of certain equipment programs.\n7.\nPrepaid Expenses and Other Assets\nPrepaid expenses and other assets consist of the following:\n_________________\n(1)    Reflects refundable deposits on expected purchases, primarily of rental equipment, pursuant to advanced purchase agreements. Such deposits are presented as a component of our cash flow from operations when paid. The decrease in 2021 primarily reflects purchases of equipment that we had placed deposits on as of December 31, 2020.\n(2)    Reflects reimbursements due for advertising that promotes a vendor’s products or services. See note 2 (\"Advertising Expense\") for further detail.\n(3)    Includes multiple items, none of which are individually significant.\n8.\nRental Equipment\nRental equipment consists of the following:\n68\n_________________\n(1)    As discussed above, disciplined management of capital expenditures and fleet capacity is a component of our COVID-19 response plan. In 2020, when we significantly reduced capital expenditures largely due to COVID-19, net rental equipment declined $\n1.082\nbillion. The increase in net rental equipment in 2021 primarily reflects net rental capital expenditures (purchases of rental equipment less proceeds from sales of rental equipment) that exceeded historic (pre-COVID-19) levels, as well as the impact of the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements. Net rental capital expenditures were $\n2.030\nbillion, $\n103\nand $\n1.301\nbillion in 2021, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively.\n9.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment consist of the following:\n10.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021:\n_________________\n(1)    The total carrying amount of goodwill for all periods in the table above is reflected net of $\n1.557\nbillion of accumulated impairment charges, which were primarily recorded in our general rentals segment.\n69\n(2)    Includes goodwill adjustments for the effect on goodwill of changes to net assets acquired during the measurement period, which were not significant to our previously reported operating results or financial condition.\n(3)    For additional detail on the May 2021 acquisition of General Finance, which was assigned to our specialty segment and accounted for most of the goodwill related to acquisitions, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther intangible assets were comprised of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nOur other intangibles assets, net at December 31, 2021 include the following assets associated with the acquisition of General Finance discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. No residual value has been assigned to these assets, which are being amortized using the sum of the years' digits method, which we believe best reflects the estimated pattern in which the economic benefits will be consumed. The intangible asset values are based on preliminary valuations and are subject to change as we obtain additional information during the acquisition measurement period, although we do not expect material future changes.\nAmortization expense for other intangible assets was $\n233\n, $\n250\nand $\n290\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, estimated amortization expense for other intangible assets for each of the next five years and thereafter was as follows:\n11.\nAccrued Expenses and Other Liabilities and Other Long-Term Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other liabilities consist of the following:\n70\n_________________\n(1)    The increase from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was primarily due to a higher bonus accrual, which reflects increased profitability.\n(2)    Primarily relates to branch closure charges and severance costs. See note 6 for additional detail.\n(3)    Reflects amounts billed to customers in excess of recognizable revenue. See note 3 for additional detail.\n(4)    Other includes multiple items, none of which are individually significant.\nOther long-term liabilities consist of the following:\n12.\nFair Value Measurements\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the amounts of our assets and liabilities that were accounted for at fair value were immaterial.\nFair value measurements are categorized in one of the following three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety:\nLevel 1—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2—Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities include:\na) quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\nb) quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets;\nc) inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability;\nd) inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or other means.\nIf the asset or liability has a specified (contractual) term, the Level 2 input must be observable for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3—Inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable (i.e., supported by little or no market activity) and significant to the fair value measure.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\nThe carrying amounts reported in our consolidated balance sheets for accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate fair value due to the immediate to short-term maturity of these financial instruments.\n71\nThe fair values of our ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and finance leases approximated their book values as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe estimated fair values of our other financial instruments, all of which are categorized in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 have been calculated based upon available market information, and were as follows:\n13.\nDebt\nDebt, net of unamortized original issue premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs, consists of the following:\n(1)    The table below presents financial information associated with our variable rate indebtedness as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. We have borrowed the full available amount under the term loan facility. The principal obligation under the term loan facility is required to be repaid in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to\n1.0\npercent per annum, with the balance due at the maturity of the facility. The average amount of debt outstanding under the term loan facility decreases slightly each quarter due to the requirement to repay a portion of the principal obligation.\nThe maximum outstanding debt under the ABL facility exceeded the average outstanding debt primarily due to the use of borrowings under the ABL facility to fund most of the cost of the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n72\n(2)    URNA redeemed all of its 5\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes in August 2021. Upon redemption, we recognized a loss of $\n30\nin interest expense, net, reflecting the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes.\n(3)    URNA separately issued 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes in August 2017 and in September 2017. Following the issuances, we consummated an exchange offer pursuant to which most of the 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes issued in September 2017 were exchanged for additional notes fungible with the 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes issued in August 2017.\n(4)    In August 2021, URNA issued $\n750\naggregate principal amount of 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Senior Notes due 2032. See below for additional detail on the issued debt.\nShort-term debt\nAs of December 31, 2021, our short-term debt primarily reflects $\n843\nof borrowings under our accounts receivable securitization facility.\nAccounts receivable securitization facility\n. In 2021, the accounts receivable securitization facility was amended, primarily to increase the facility size and to extend the maturity date which may be further extended on a\n364\n-day basis by mutual agreement with the purchasers under the facility. The amended facility expires on June 24, 2022 and has a facility size of $\n900\n. Borrowings under the facility are reflected as short-term debt on our consolidated balance sheets. Key provisions of the facility include the following:\n•\nborrowings are permitted only to the extent that the face amount of the receivables in the collateral pool, net of applicable reserves, exceeds the outstanding loans by a specified amount. As of December 31, 2021, there were $\n1.180\nbillion of receivables, net of applicable reserves, in the collateral pool;\n•\nthe receivables in the collateral pool are the lenders’ only source of repayment;\n•\nupon early termination of the facility, no new amounts will be advanced under the facility and collections on the receivables securing the facility will be used to repay the outstanding borrowings; and\n•\nstandard termination events including, without limitation, a change of control of Holdings, URNA or certain of its subsidiaries, a failure to make payments, a failure to comply with standard default, delinquency, dilution and days sales outstanding covenants, or breach of the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility (if applicable).\nSee the table above for financial information associated with the accounts receivable securitization facility.\nLong-term debt\nABL facility.\nIn June 2008, Holdings, URNA, and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement providing for a\nfive-year\n$\n1.25\nbillion ABL facility, a portion of which is available for borrowing in Canadian dollars. The ABL facility was subsequently upsized and extended, and a portion of the facility is also now available for borrowing in British pounds, Euros, Australian dollars and New Zealand dollars by certain subsidiaries of URNA in Europe, Australia and New Zealand. The size of the ABL facility was $\n3.75\nbillion as of December 31, 2021. See the table above for financial information associated with the ABL facility.\nThe ABL facility is subject to, among other things, the terms of a borrowing base derived from the value of eligible rental equipment and eligible inventory. The borrowing base is subject to certain reserves and caps customary for financings of this type. All amounts borrowed under the credit agreement must be repaid on or before February 2024. Loans under the credit agreement bear interest, at URNA’s option: (i) in the case of loans in U.S. dollars, at a rate equal to the London interbank offered rate or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a spread, (ii) in the case of loans in Canadian dollars, at a rate equal to the Canadian prime rate or an alternate rate (Bankers' Acceptance Rate), in each case plus a spread, (iii) in the case of loans in Euros, at a rate equal to the London interbank offered rate or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a spread, (iv) in the case of loans in British pounds, at a rate equal to daily simple Sterling Overnight Interbank Average or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a spread or (v) in the case of loans in Australian Dollars or New Zealand Dollars, at a rate equal to the applicable bank bill rate or an alternate base rate, in each case plus a spread. The interest rates under the credit agreement are subject to change based on the availability in the facility. A commitment fee accrues on any unused portion of the commitments under the credit agreement at a fixed rate per annum. Ongoing extensions of credit under the credit agreement are subject to customary conditions, including sufficient availability under the borrowing base. As discussed below (see “Loan Covenants and Compliance”), the only financial covenant that currently exists in the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. As of December 31, 2021, availability under the ABL facility has exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. In addition, the credit agreement contains customary negative covenants applicable to Holdings, URNA and our subsidiaries, including negative covenants that restrict the ability of such entities to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness or engage in certain other types of financing transactions, (ii) allow certain liens to attach to\n73\nassets, (iii) repurchase, or pay dividends or make certain other restricted payments on, capital stock and certain other securities, (iv) prepay certain indebtedness and (v) make acquisitions and investments. The borrowings under the credit agreement by URNA are secured by substantially all of our assets and substantially all of the assets of certain of our U.S. subsidiaries (other than real property and certain accounts receivable). The borrowings under the credit agreement by URNA are guaranteed by Holdings and, subject to certain exceptions, our domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under the credit agreement by URNA’s Canadian subsidiaries are also secured by substantially all the assets of URNA’s Canadian subsidiaries and supported by guarantees from the Canadian subsidiaries and from Holdings and URNA, and, subject to certain exceptions, our domestic subsidiaries. Borrowings under the credit agreement by URNA’s subsidiaries in Europe, Puerto Rico, Australia and New Zealand are guaranteed by Holdings, URNA, URNA’s Canadian subsidiaries and, subject to certain exceptions, our domestic subsidiaries and secured by substantially all the assets of our U.S. subsidiaries (other than real property and certain accounts receivable) and substantially all the assets of URNA’s Canadian subsidiaries. Under the ABL facility, a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) constitutes an event of default, entitling our lenders, among other things, to terminate our ABL facility and to require us to repay outstanding borrowings.\nTerm loan facility\n. In October 2018, Holdings, URNA, and certain of our subsidiaries entered into a $\n1\nbillion senior secured term loan facility. See the table above for financial information associated with the term loan facility. The term loan facility is guaranteed by Holdings and the same domestic subsidiaries that guarantee the borrowings of URNA under the ABL facility. In addition, the obligations under the term loan facility are secured by first priority security interests in the same collateral that secures the borrowings of URNA under the ABL facility, on a pari passu basis with the ABL facility.\nThe principal obligations under the term loan facility are to be repaid in quarterly installments in an aggregate amount equal to\n1.0\npercent per annum, with the balance due at the maturity of the term loan facility. The term loan facility matures on October 31, 2025. Amounts drawn under the term loan facility bear annual interest, at URNA’s option, at either the London interbank offered rate plus a margin of\n1.75\npercent or at an alternative base rate plus a margin of\n0.75\npercent.\nThe term loan facility contains customary negative covenants applicable to URNA and its subsidiaries, including negative covenants that restrict the ability of such entities to, among other things, (i) incur additional indebtedness; (ii) incur additional liens; (iii) make dividends and other restricted payments; and (iv) engage in mergers, acquisitions and dispositions. The term loan facility does not include any financial covenants. Under the term loan facility, a change of control (as defined in the credit agreement) constitutes an event of default, entitling our lenders to, among other things, terminate the term loan facility and require us to repay outstanding loans.\n5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Senior Notes due 2027.\nIn November 2016, URNA issued $\n750\naggregate principal amount of 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Senior Notes which are due May 15, 2027 (the “2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes”). In February 2017, URNA issued $\n250\naggregate principal amount of 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes as an add-on to the existing 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes, after which the aggregate principal amount of outstanding 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes was $\n1.0\nbillion. The notes issued in February 2017 have identical terms, and are fungible, with the existing 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes. The 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after May 15, 2022, at specified redemption prices that range from\n102.75\npercent in 2022, to\n100\npercent in 2025 and thereafter, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens; (ii) additional indebtedness; (iii) mergers, consolidations and acquisitions; (iv) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (v) loans and other investments; (vi) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; (vii) restrictions affecting subsidiaries; (viii) transactions with affiliates; and (ix) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon. The carrying value of the 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes includes the $\n2\nunamortized portion of the original issue premium recognized in conjunction with the February 2017 issuance, which is being amortized through the maturity date in 2027. The effective interest rate on the 2027 5\n1\n/\n2\npercent Notes, which includes the impact of the original issue premium, is\n5.5\npercent.\n3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Secured Notes due 2027.\nIn November 2019, URNA issued $\n750\naggregate principal amount of 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Secured Notes (the “3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes”) which are due November 15, 2027. The 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA and are secured on a second-priority basis by liens on substantially all of URNA’s and the guarantors’ assets that secure the ABL facility and the term loan facility, subject to certain exceptions. The 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after November 15, 2022, at specified redemption prices that range from\n101.938\npercent in 2022, to\n100\npercent in 2025 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time on or prior to November 15, 2022, up to\n40\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent\n74\nNotes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to\n103.875\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens and (ii) mergers and consolidations, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the requirements to provide subsidiary guarantees, to give further assurances and to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon.\n4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes due 2028\n. In August 2017, URNA issued $\n925\nprincipal amount of 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes (the “Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes”) which are due January 15, 2028. The Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after January 15, 2023, at specified redemption prices that range from\n102.438\npercent in 2023, to\n100\npercent in 2026 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens; (ii) mergers and consolidations; (iii) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (iv) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; and (v) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the covenant relating to dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments and the requirements relating to additional subsidiary guarantors will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon.\nIn September 2017, URNA issued $\n750\nprincipal amount of 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes (the “Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes”) which are due January 15, 2028. The Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes represent a separate a distinct series of notes from the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes. The Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after January 15, 2023, at specified redemption prices that range from\n102.438\npercent in 2023, to\n100\npercent in 2026 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens; (ii) mergers and consolidations; (iii) sales, transfers and other dispositions of assets; (iv) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments; and (v) designations of unrestricted subsidiaries, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the covenant relating to dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments and the requirements relating to additional subsidiary guarantors will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon. The effective interest rate on the Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes, which includes the impact of the original issue premium, is\n4.84\npercent.\nIn December 2017, we consummated an exchange offer pursuant to which approximately $\n744\nprincipal amount of Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes were exchanged for additional Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes issued under the indenture governing the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes and fungible with the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes. As of December 31, 2021, the principal amounts outstanding were $\n1.669\nbillion for the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes and $\n4\nfor the Subsequent 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes. The carrying value of the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes includes $\n1\nof the unamortized original issue premium, which is being amortized through the maturity date in 2028. The effective interest rate on the Initial 4\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes, which includes the impact of the original issue premium, is\n4.86\npercent.\n75\n5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Senior Notes due 2030.\nIn May 2019, URNA issued $\n750\naggregate principal amount of 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Senior Notes (the “5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes”) which are due January 15, 2030. The 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after January 15, 2025, at specified redemption prices that range from\n102.625\npercent in 2025, to\n100\npercent in 2028 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time on or prior to January 15, 2023, up to\n40\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to\n105.250\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens; (ii) mergers and consolidations; and (iii) dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the covenant relating to dividends and other distributions, stock repurchases and redemptions and other restricted payments and the requirements relating to additional subsidiary guarantors will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 5\n1\n/\n4\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon.\n4\npercent Senior Notes due 2030.\nIn February 2020, URNA issued $\n750\naggregate principal amount of 4 percent Notes which are due July 15, 2030. The 4 percent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 4 percent Notes may be redeemed on or after July 15, 2025, at specified redemption prices that range from\n102.000\npercent in 2025, to\n100\npercent in 2028 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time on or prior to July 15, 2023, up to\n40\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the 4 percent Notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to\n104.000\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 4 percent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens and (ii) mergers and consolidations, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the requirements to provide subsidiary guarantees and to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the 4 percent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 4 percent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon.\n3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes due 2031.\nIn August 2020, URNA issued $\n1.100\nbillion aggregate principal amount of 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes (the “3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes”) which are due February 15, 2031. The 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are unsecured and are guaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after August 15, 2025, at specified redemption prices that range from\n101.938\npercent in 2025, to\n100\npercent in 2028 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time on or prior to August 15, 2023, up to\n40\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to\n103.875\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens and (ii) mergers and consolidations, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions. In addition, the requirements to provide subsidiary guarantees and to make an offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control will not apply to URNA and its restricted subsidiaries during any period when the 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes are rated investment grade by both Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services and Moody’s Investors Service, Inc., or, in certain circumstances, another rating agency selected by URNA, provided at such time no default under the indenture has occurred and is continuing. The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 3\n7\n/\n8\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon.\n3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Senior Notes due 2032.\nIn August 2021, URNA issued $\n750\naggregate principal amount of 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Senior Notes (the “3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Notes”) which are due January 15, 2032. The 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Notes are unsecured and are\n76\nguaranteed by Holdings and certain domestic subsidiaries of URNA. The 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Notes may be redeemed on or after July 15, 2026, at specified redemption prices that range from\n101.875\npercent in 2026, to\n100\npercent in 2029 and thereafter, in each case, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. In addition, at any time on or prior to July 30, 2024, up to\n40\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Notes may be redeemed with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings at a redemption price equal to\n103.750\npercent of the aggregate principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The indenture governing the 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Notes contains certain restrictive covenants, including, among others, limitations on (i) liens and (ii) mergers and consolidations, as well as a requirement to timely file periodic reports with the SEC. Each of the restrictive covenants is subject to important exceptions and qualifications that would allow URNA and its subsidiaries to engage in these activities under certain conditions.

The indenture also requires that, in the event of a change of control (as defined in the indenture), URNA must make an offer to purchase all of the then-outstanding 3\n3\n/\n4\npercent Notes tendered at a purchase price in cash equal to\n101\npercent of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, thereon.\nLoan Covenants and Compliance\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants and other provisions of the ABL, accounts receivable securitization and term loan facilities and the senior notes. Any failure to be in compliance with any material provision or covenant of these agreements could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and operations.\nThe only financial covenant that currently exists under the ABL facility is the fixed charge coverage ratio. Subject to certain limited exceptions specified in the ABL facility, the fixed charge coverage ratio covenant under the ABL facility will only apply in the future if specified availability under the ABL facility falls below\n10\npercent of the maximum revolver amount under the ABL facility. When certain conditions are met, cash and cash equivalents and borrowing base collateral in excess of the ABL facility size may be included when calculating specified availability under the ABL facility. As of December 31, 2021, specified availability under the ABL facility exceeded the required threshold and, as a result, this financial covenant was inapplicable. Under our accounts receivable securitization facility, we are required, among other things, to maintain certain financial tests relating to: (i) the default ratio, (ii) the delinquency ratio, (iii) the dilution ratio and (iv) days sales outstanding. The accounts receivable securitization facility also requires us to comply with the fixed charge coverage ratio under the ABL facility, to the extent the ratio is applicable under the ABL facility.\nMaturities\nDebt maturities (exclusive of any unamortized original issue premiums and unamortized debt issuance costs) for each of the next five years and thereafter at December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n14.\nLeases\nAs discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements, most of our equipment rental revenue is accounted for as lease revenue under Topic 842 (such revenue represented\n77\npercent of our total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021). See note 3 for a discussion of our revenue accounting (such discussion includes lessor disclosures required under Topic 842).\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Our material lease contracts are generally for real estate or vehicles, and the determination of whether such contracts contain leases generally does not require significant estimates or judgments. We lease real estate and equipment under operating leases. We lease a significant portion of our branch locations, and also lease other premises used for purposes such as district and regional offices and service centers. Our finance lease obligations consist primarily of rental equipment (primarily vehicles) and building leases.\n77\nOperating leases result in the recognition of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use the leased asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date to determine the present value of lease payments. The operating lease ROU assets also include any lease payments made and exclude lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options, at our sole discretion, to extend or terminate the lease that we are reasonably certain to exercise. The amount of payments associated with such options reflected in the “Maturity of lease liabilities” table below is not material. Most real estate leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from\n1\nto\n5\nyears or more. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense on such leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The primary leases we enter into with initial terms of 12 months or less are for equipment that we rent from vendors and then rent to our customers. We generate sublease revenue from such leases that we refer to as \"re-rent revenue\" as discussed in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements. Apart from the re-rent revenue discussed in note 3, we do not generate material sublease income.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and, for our real estate operating leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Our lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nThe tables below present financial information associated with our leases as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n_________________\n(1)    The increases in 2021 include the impact of the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n78\n_________________\n(1)    Includes variable lease costs, which are immaterial. Cost of equipment rentals, excluding depreciation for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes $\n163\n, $\n124\nand $\n142\n, respectively, of short-term lease costs associated with equipment that we rent from vendors and then rent to our customers, as discussed further above. Apart from these costs, short-term lease costs are immaterial.\n(2)    Primarily reflects re-rent revenue as discussed further above.\n_________________\n(1)    Reflects payments for non-cancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more as of December 31, 2021. The table above does not include any legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced, and such leases are not material in the aggregate.\n(2)    The table above does not include any legally binding minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced, and such leases are not material in the aggregate.\n79\n_________________\n(1)    The increase in 2021 includes the impact of the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\n15.\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of the provision (benefit) for income taxes for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nA reconciliation of the provision (benefit) for income taxes and the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate of 21 percent to the income before provision (benefit) for income taxes for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nThe components of deferred income tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\n80\n_________________\n(1)    Relates to state net operating loss carryforwards and state tax credits that may not be realized.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S., Canada and Europe. Without exception, we have completed our domestic and international income tax examinations, or the statute of limitations has expired in the respective jurisdictions, for years prior to 2012.\nFor financial reporting purposes, income before provision for income taxes for our foreign subsidiaries was $\n134\n, $\n83\nand $\n62\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe have historically considered the undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries to be indefinitely reinvested, and, accordingly, no taxes were provided on such earnings prior to the fourth quarter of 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs, and determined that such cash could no longer be considered indefinitely reinvested. As a result, our prior assertion that all undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries should be considered indefinitely reinvested changed. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified additional cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs, and remitted $\n203\nof cash from foreign operations (such amount represents the cumulative amount of identified cash in our foreign operations in excess of near-term working capital needs). The taxes recorded associated with the remitted cash were immaterial in both 2020 and 2021.\nWe continue to expect that the remaining balance of our undistributed foreign earnings will be indefinitely reinvested. If we determine that all or a portion of such foreign earnings are no longer indefinitely reinvested, we may be subject to additional foreign withholding taxes and U.S. state income taxes. At December 31, 2021, unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries were $\n737\n. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability on these unremitted earnings is not practicable.\nWe have net operating loss carryforwards (“NOLs”) of $\n475\nfor federal income tax purposes that expire from 2032 through 2037, $\n3\nfor foreign income tax purposes that expire from 2024 through 2030 and $\n621\nfor state income tax purposes that expire from 2022 through 2034.\n16.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWe are subject to a number of claims and proceedings that generally arise in the ordinary conduct of our business. These matters include, but are not limited to, general liability claims (including personal injury, product liability, and property and automobile claims), indemnification and guarantee obligations, employee injuries and employment-related claims, self-insurance obligations and contract and real estate matters. Based on advice of counsel and available information, including current status or stage of proceeding, and taking into account accruals included in our consolidated balance sheets for matters where we have established them, we currently believe that any liabilities ultimately resulting from these ordinary course claims and proceedings will not, individually or in the aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIndemnification\nThe Company indemnifies its officers and directors pursuant to indemnification agreements and may in addition indemnify these individuals as permitted by Delaware law.\n81\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nWe currently sponsor\ntwo\ndefined contribution 401(k) retirement plans, which are subject to the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. We also sponsor a deferred profit sharing plan and a registered retirement savings plan for the benefit of the full-time employees of our Canadian subsidiaries. Under these plans, we match a percentage of the participants’ contributions up to a specified amount. Company contributions to the plans were $\n36\n, $\n33\nand $\n37\nin the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company and its operations are subject to various laws and related regulations governing environmental matters. Under such laws, an owner or lessee of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances located on or in, or emanating from, such property, as well as investigation of property damage. We incur ongoing expenses associated with the performance of appropriate remediation at certain locations.\n17.\nCommon Stock\nWe have\n500\nmillion authorized shares of common stock, $\n0.01\npar value. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were\n0.0 million\nshares of common stock reserved for issuance pursuant to options granted under our stock option plans.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were an aggregate of\n0.7\nmillion outstanding time and performance-based RSUs and\n1.8\nmillion shares available for grants of stock and options under our 2019 Long Term Incentive Plan.\nA summary of the transactions within the Company’s stock option plans follows (shares in thousands):\nThe following table presents information associated with stock options as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. No stock options were granted during any of the years presented below.\nIn addition to stock options, the Company issues time-based and performance-based RSUs to certain officers and key executives under various equity incentive plans. The RSUs automatically convert to shares of common stock on a\none\n-for-one basis as the awards vest. The time-based RSUs typically vest over a\nthree year\nvesting period beginning\n12\nmonths from the grant date and thereafter annually on the anniversary of the grant date. The performance-based RSUs vest based on the achievement of the performance conditions during the applicable performance periods (currently the calendar year). There were\n219\nthousand shares of common stock issued upon vesting of RSUs during 2021, net of\n123\nthousand shares surrendered to satisfy tax obligations. The Company measures the value of RSUs at fair value based on the closing price of the underlying common stock on the grant date. The Company amortizes the fair value of outstanding RSUs as stock-based compensation expense over the requisite service period on a straight-line basis, or sooner if the employee effectively vests upon termination of employment under certain circumstances. For performance-based RSUs, compensation expense is recognized to the extent that the satisfaction of the performance condition is considered probable.\nA summary of RSUs granted follows (RSUs in thousands):\n82\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total pretax compensation cost not yet recognized by the Company with regard to unvested RSUs was $\n48\n. The weighted-average period over which this compensation cost is expected to be recognized is\n2.0\nyears.\nA summary of RSU activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 follows (RSUs in thousands):\nThe total fair value of RSUs vested during the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n94\n, $\n75\n, and $\n80\n, respectively.\nDividend Policy\n. Holdings has not paid dividends on its common stock since inception. The payment of any future dividends or the authorization of stock repurchases or other recapitalizations will be determined by our Board of Directors in light of conditions then existing, including earnings, financial condition and capital requirements, financing agreements, business conditions, stock price and other factors. The terms of certain agreements governing our outstanding indebtedness contain certain limitations on our ability to move operating cash flows to Holdings and/or to pay dividends on, or effect repurchases of, our common stock. In addition, under Delaware law, dividends may only be paid out of surplus or current or prior year’s net profits.\nStockholders’ Rights Plan.\nOur stockholders' rights plan expired in accordance with its terms in 2011. Our Board of Directors elected not to renew or extend the plan.\n18.\nQuarterly Financial Information (Unaudited)\n83\n(1)    As discussed in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements, COVID-19 has significantly disrupted supply chains and businesses around the world. We began to experience a decline in revenues in March 2020, when rental volume declined in response to shelter-in-place orders and other market restrictions. The volume declines were more pronounced in 2020 than 2021, and we have seen recent evidence of recovery across our construction and industrial markets, as well as encouraging gains in end-market indicators, as reflected in our 2022 forecast.\n(2)    There were no unusual or infrequently occurring items recognized in the fourth quarter of 2021 that had a material impact on our financial statements. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we redeemed all of our 4\n5\n/\n8\npercent Senior Notes due 2025, and recognized a redemption loss of $\n24\nin interest expense, net. The loss represented the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes.\n(3)    Diluted earnings per share includes the after-tax impacts of the following:\n(4)\nThis reflects transaction costs associated with the General Finance acquisition discussed in note 4 to our consolidated financial statements. Merger related costs only include costs associated with major acquisitions that significantly impact our operations (the \"major acquisitions,\" each of which had annual revenues of over $\n200\nprior to acquisition). For additional information, see \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations-Results of Operations-Other costs/(income)-merger related costs\".\n(5)\nThis reflects the amortization of the intangible assets acquired in the major acquisitions.\n(6)\nThis reflects the impact of extending the useful lives of equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions, net of the impact of additional depreciation associated with the fair value mark-up of such equipment.\n(7)\nThis reflects additional costs recorded in cost of rental equipment sales associated with the fair value mark-up of rental equipment acquired in certain major acquisitions that was subsequently sold.\n(8)\nAs discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, this primarily reflects severance costs and branch closure charges associated with our restructuring programs.\n(9)\nThis reflects write-offs of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets. As discussed in note 6 to our consolidated financial statements, the 2020 charges primarily reflect the discontinuation of certain equipment programs, and were not related to COVID-19.\n(10)\nReflects the difference between the net carrying amount and the total purchase price of the redeemed notes.\n19.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of common shares plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (shares in thousands):\n84\nSCHEDULE II—VALUATION AND QUALIFYING ACCOUNTS\nUNITED RENTALS, INC.\n(In millions)\nThe above information reflects the continuing operations of the Company for the periods presented. Additionally, because the Company has retained certain self-insurance liabilities associated with the discontinued traffic control business, those amounts have been included as well.\n(a)    Amounts charged to cost and expenses reflect bad debt expenses recognized within selling, general and administrative expenses. The amounts charged to revenue primarily reflect doubtful accounts associated with lease revenues that were recognized as a reduction to equipment rentals revenue.\n(b)    Primarily represents write-offs of accounts, net of recoveries and other activity.\n(c)    Primarily represents write-offs.\n(d)    Represents payments."

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\n85\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the Company’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nThe Company’s management carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined in Rules 13a–15(e) and 15d–15(e) of the Exchange Act, as of December 31, 2021. Based on the evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rules 13a–15(f) and 15d–15(f) under the Exchange Act. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nUnder the supervision of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, our management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework\n(2013 framework) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). Based on this assessment, our management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company’s financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K have been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, independent registered public accounting firm, as indicated in the following report. Ernst & Young LLP has also provided an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\n86\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of United Rentals, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited United Rentals, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, United Rentals, Inc. (the “Company”) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and schedule of the Company and our report dated January 26, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Controls over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nStamford, Connecticut\nJanuary 26, 2022\n87\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
