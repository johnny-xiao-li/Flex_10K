    "text": "General\nNVR, Inc., a Virginia corporation, was formed in 1980 as NVHomes, Inc. Our primary business is the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings, all of which are primarily constructed on a pre-sold basis. To more fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations, we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business. We conduct our homebuilding activities directly. Our mortgage banking operations are operated primarily through a wholly owned subsidiary, NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. (“NVRM”). Unless the context otherwise requires, references to “NVR”, “we”, “us” or “our” include NVR, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nWe are one of the largest homebuilders in the United States. We operate in thirty-four metropolitan areas in fourteen states, and Washington, D.C.  Our homebuilding operations include the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings under three trade names: Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes. Our Ryan Homes product is marketed primarily to first-time and first-time move-up buyers. Ryan Homes operates in thirty-four metropolitan areas located in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee. Our NVHomes and Heartland Homes products are marketed primarily to move-up and luxury buyers. NVHomes operates in Delaware and the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD and Philadelphia, PA metropolitan areas. Heartland Homes operates in the Pittsburgh, PA metropolitan area.  During 2021, approximately 16% of our home settlements accounting for approximately 22% of our homebuilding revenue occurred in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nWe generally do not engage in land development (see discussion below of our land development activities). Instead, we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers pursuant to fixed price finished lot purchase agreements (“LPAs”) that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the LPAs. The deposits required under the LPAs are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and typically range up to 10% of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe believe that our lot acquisition strategy avoids the financial requirements and risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. We may, at our option, choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these LPAs by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract. Our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these LPAs is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provision contained within the LPAs. We do not have any financial guarantees or completion obligations and we typically do not guarantee lot purchases on a specific performance basis under these LPAs. None of the creditors of any of the development entities with which we have entered these LPAs have recourse to our general credit. We generally seek to maintain control over a supply of lots believed to be suitable to meet our five-year business plan.\nIn addition to constructing homes primarily on a pre-sold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy, we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve. This strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets, which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets. Our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build. As a result, in certain specific strategic circumstances we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development. Once we acquire control of raw ground, we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an LPA with the developer to purchase the finished lots or hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf. While joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots, we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so. We expect, however, to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using LPAs with forfeitable deposits. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of lots controlled.  In addition, see Notes 3, 4 and 5 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding LPAs, joint ventures and land under development, respectively.\nIn addition to building and selling homes, we provide a number of mortgage-related services through our mortgage banking operations. Through operations in each of our homebuilding markets, NVRM originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuyers. NVRM generates revenues primarily from origination fees, gains on sales of loans and title fees. NVRM sells all of the mortgage loans it closes into the secondary markets on a servicing released basis.\nSegment information for our homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses is included in Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n1\nHomebuilding\nProducts\nWe offer single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings with many different home designs. These home designs have a variety of elevations and numerous other options. Our homes combine traditional, transitional, cottage or urban exterior designs with contemporary interior designs and amenities, generally include two to four bedrooms and range from approximately 1,000 to 10,000 finished square feet. During 2021, the prices at which we settled homes ranged from approximately $140,000 to $2 million and averaged $403,900. During 2020, our average price of homes settled was $370,800.\nMarkets\nOur four reportable homebuilding segments operate in the following geographic regions:\nBacklog\nBacklog, which represents homes sold but not yet settled with the customer, totaled 12,730 units and approximately $5.8 billion at December 31, 2021 compared to 11,549 units and approximately $4.6 billion at December 31, 2020. The average price of homes in backlog increased to $454,200 at December 31, 2021 from $396,200 at December 31,2020. Backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, such as the customer’s failure to obtain mortgage financing, inability to sell an existing home, job loss or a variety of other reasons. In any period, a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period, and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the opening backlog for the current period. Expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross sales during the period, our cancellation rate was 9.2%, 14.9% and 14.6% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Additionally, approximately 3% in 2021, and 6% in both 2020 and 2019, of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog balance cancelled during the quarter. We can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future periods. Other than those units that are cancelled, and subject to potential construction delays resulting from COVID-19 related restrictions and/or continued supply chain disruptions, we expect to settle substantially all of our December 31, 2021 backlog during 2022. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A and “Seasonality” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nFurther discussion of settlements, new orders and backlog activity by our homebuilding reportable segment for each of the last three years can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K.\nConstruction\nWe utilize independent subcontractors under fixed price contracts to perform construction work on our homes. We use many independent subcontractors in our various markets and we are not dependent on any single subcontractor or on a small number of subcontractors.\nSales and Marketing\nOur preferred marketing method is for customers to visit a furnished model home featuring many built-in options and a landscaped lot. The garages of these model homes are usually converted into temporary sales centers where alternative facades and floor plans are displayed and designs for other models are available for review. Sales representatives are compensated predominantly on a commission basis.\nRegulation\nWe and our subcontractors must comply with various federal, state and local zoning, building, environmental, advertising and consumer credit statutes, rules and regulations, as well as other regulations and requirements in connection with our construction and sales activities. All of these regulations have increased the cost to produce and market our products, and in some instances, have delayed our developers’ ability to deliver finished lots to us. Counties and cities in which we build homes have at times declared moratoriums on the issuance of building permits and imposed other restrictions in the areas in which sewage treatment facilities and other public facilities do not reach minimum standards. In addition, our homebuilding operations are regulated in certain areas by restrictive zoning and density requirements that limit the number of homes that can be built within the boundaries of a particular area. To date, restrictive zoning laws and the imposition of moratoriums have not had a material adverse effect on our construction activities.\n2\nCompetition and Market Factors\nThe housing industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size, ranging from local to national in scope, some of which have greater financial resources than we do. We also face competition from the home resale market. Our homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and reputation. Historically, we have been one of the market leaders in each of the markets where we build homes.\nThe housing industry is cyclical and is affected by consumer confidence levels, prevailing economic conditions and interest rates. Other factors that affect the housing industry and the demand for new homes include: the availability and the cost of land, labor and materials; changes in consumer preferences; demographic trends; and the availability of mortgage finance programs. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for additional information regarding these risks.\nWe are dependent upon building material suppliers for a continuous flow of raw materials. Whenever possible, we utilize standard products available from multiple sources. In the past, such raw materials have been generally available to us in adequate supply, however, during 2021 increased construction activity and demand for building materials, coupled with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to supply chain disruptions and longer construction cycle times.\nMortgage Banking\nWe provide a number of mortgage related services to our homebuilding customers through our mortgage banking operations. Our mortgage banking operations also include separate subsidiaries that broker title insurance and perform title searches in connection with mortgage loan closings for which they receive commissions and fees. Because NVRM originates mortgage loans almost exclusively for our homebuilding customers, NVRM is dependent on our homebuilding segment. In 2021, NVRM closed approximately 17,700 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $6.1 billion as compared to approximately 16,700 loans with an aggregate principal amount of approximately $5.3 billion in 2020.\nNVRM sells all of the mortgage loans it closes to investors in the secondary markets on a servicing released basis, typically within 30 days from the loan closing. NVRM is an approved seller/servicer for Fannie Mae (“FNMA”) and Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\") mortgage loans and an approved seller/issuer of Ginnie Mae (“GNMA”), Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”) mortgage loans.\nRegulation\nNVRM is subject to the rules and regulations of FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA. These rules and regulations restrict certain activities of NVRM. NVRM is currently eligible and expects to remain eligible to participate in such programs. In addition, NVRM is subject to regulation at the state and federal level, including regulations issued by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (the “CFPB”) with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices.\nCompetition and Market Factors\nNVRM’s main competition comes from national, regional, and local mortgage bankers, mortgage brokers, credit unions and banks in each of these markets. NVRM competes primarily on the basis of customer service, variety of products offered, interest rates offered, prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs.\nPipeline\nNVRM’s mortgage loans in process that had not closed had an aggregate principal balance of approximately $3.9 billion as of  December 31, 2021 compared to approximately $3.4 billion as of December 31, 2020.  NVRM’s cancellation rate was approximately 41%, 40% and 36% in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We can provide no assurance that our historical loan cancellation rates are indicative of the actual loan cancellation rate that may occur in future periods. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A in this Form 10-K for additional information about factors that could increase our cancellation rate.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 6,600 full time employees, of whom approximately 5,600 worked in our homebuilding operations, and approximately 1,000 worked in our mortgage banking operations, compared to December 31, 2020, when we had approximately 6,100 full time employees, of whom approximately 5,100 worked in our homebuilding operations, and approximately 1,000 worked in our mortgage banking operations.  None of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nOur employees are our most important asset.  We are committed to hiring and developing an inclusive workplace with a strong diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. All of our employees must adhere to our code of ethics and standards of business conduct that sets standards for appropriate behavior in the workplace.  Our compensation philosophy has been consistent for over 20 years and is designed to motivate and retain highly qualified and experienced employees.\nWe provide tools for the advancement of our employees by offering training and development opportunities that align with each employee’s responsibilities and career path. We strive to promote employees from within our workforce, as we believe this provides\n3\nboth long-term success and continuity to our operations and growth for our employees. Our focus is demonstrated by the tenure of our executives and our regional and division leaders.\nDuring the past year, we hired additional employees to meet the strong housing demand and generally increased our employees’ compensation and benefits packages. To protect our employees and homebuyers during the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented safety protocols, such as social distancing on job sites, doing virtual house tours, working remotely and other health and safety standards as required by federal, state and local government agencies. We believe our employees adapted and have successfully managed the business during the pandemic.\nAvailable Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”). These filings are available to the public over the internet at the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.\nOur principal internet website can be found at\nwww.nvrinc.com\n.\nWe make available free of charge on or through our website, access to our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed, or furnished, to the SEC.\nOur website also includes a corporate governance section which contains our Corporate Governance Guidelines (which includes our Directors’ Independence Standards), Code of Ethics and Standards of Business Conduct, Board Committee Charters, Policies and Procedures for the Consideration of Board of Director Candidates, and Policies and Procedures Regarding Communications with the NVR, Inc. Board of Directors, the Independent Lead Director and the Non-Management Directors as a Group.\nForward-Looking Statements\nSome of the statements in this Form 10-K, as well as statements made by us in periodic press releases or other public communications, constitute “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

    "text": "Our business is affected by the risks generally incident to the residential construction business, including, but not limited to:\n•\nactual and expected direction of interest rates, which affect the availability of mortgage financing for potential purchasers of homes;\n•\nthe availability of adequate land in desirable locations on favorable terms;\n•\nemployment levels, consumer confidence and spending and unexpected changes in customer preferences; and\n•\nchanges in the national economy and in the local economies of the markets in which we operate.\nAll of these risks are discussed in detail below.\nBusiness and Industry Risks\nAn economic downturn or decline in economic conditions could adversely affect our business and our results of operations.\nDemand for new homes is sensitive to economic changes driven by conditions such as employment levels, job growth, consumer confidence, inflation and interest rates.  If the housing industry suffers a downturn, our sales may decline which could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\n4\nInterest rate movements, inflation and other economic factors can negatively impact our business.\nHigh rates of inflation generally affect the homebuilding industry adversely because of their adverse impact on interest rates. High interest rates not only increase the cost of borrowed funds to homebuilders but also have a significant adverse effect on housing demand and on the affordability of permanent mortgage financing to prospective purchasers. We are also subject to potential volatility in the price of commodities that impact costs of materials used in our homebuilding business. Increases in prevailing interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nOur financial results also are affected by the risks generally incident to our mortgage banking business, including interest rate levels, the impact of government regulation on mortgage loan originations and servicing and the need to issue forward commitments to fund and sell mortgage loans. Our homebuilding customers account for almost all of our mortgage banking business. The volume of our continuing homebuilding operations therefore affects our mortgage banking business.\nOur mortgage banking business also is affected by interest rate fluctuations. We also may experience marketing losses resulting from daily increases in interest rates to the extent we are unable to match interest rates and amounts on loans we have committed to originate with forward commitments from third parties to purchase such loans. Increases in interest rates may have a material adverse effect on our mortgage banking revenue, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nOur operations may also be adversely affected by other economic factors within our markets such as negative changes in employment levels, job growth, wage growth, consumer confidence and household formation and availability of mortgage financing, one or all of which could result in reduced demand or price depression from current levels. Such negative trends could have a material adverse effect on homebuilding operations.\nThese factors and thus, the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses, have at times in the past been cyclical in nature. Any downturn in the national economy or the local economies of the markets in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance and ability to service our debt obligations. In particular, during 2021, approximately 16% of our home settlements, which accounted for 22% of our homebuilding revenues, occurred in the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area. Thus, we are dependent to a significant extent on the economy and demand for housing in that market.\nBecause almost all of our customers require mortgage financing, the availability of suitable mortgage financing could impair the affordability of our homes, lower demand for our products, and limit our ability to fully deliver our backlog.\nOur business and earnings depend on the ability of our potential customers to obtain mortgages for the purchase of our homes. In addition, many of our potential customers must sell their existing homes in order to buy a home from us. The tightening of credit standards and the availability of suitable mortgage financing could prevent customers from buying our homes and could prevent buyers of our customers’ homes from obtaining mortgages they need to complete that purchase, either of which could result in potential customers’ inability to buy a home from us. If potential customers or the buyers of our customers’ current homes are not able to obtain suitable financing, the result could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nIf our ability to sell mortgages to investors is impaired, we may be required to fund these commitments ourselves, or we may not be able to originate loans at all.\nOur mortgage banking business sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market, usually within 30 days from the date of closing, and has up to $150 million available under a repurchase agreement to fund mortgage closings. See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources” in Item 7 of this Form 10-K for more information about the repurchase agreement. In the event that disruptions to the secondary markets tighten or eliminate the available liquidity within the secondary markets for mortgage loans, or the underwriting requirements by our secondary market investors continue to become more stringent, our ability to sell future mortgages could decline and we could be required, among other things, to fund our commitments to our buyers with our own financial resources, which is limited, or require our home buyers to find another source of financing. The result of such secondary market disruption could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nIf the market value of our inventory or controlled lot position declines, our profit could decrease and we may incur losses.\nInventory risk can be substantial for homebuilders. The market value of building lots and housing inventories can fluctuate significantly as a result of changing market conditions. In addition, inventory carrying costs can be significant and can result in losses in a poorly performing community or market. We must continuously acquire lots for expansion into new markets as well as for replacement and expansion within our current markets, which we generally accomplish by entering into LPAs and paying forfeitable deposits under the LPAs to developers for the contractual right to acquire the lots. In the event of adverse changes in economic, market or community conditions, we may cease further building activities in certain communities or restructure existing LPAs, resulting in forfeiture of some or all of any remaining land contract deposit paid to the developer. We may also have significant impairments of land under development. The forfeiture of land contract deposits or inventory impairments may result in a loss that could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\n5\nWe face competition in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations.\nThe homebuilding industry is highly competitive. We compete with numerous homebuilders of varying size, ranging from local to national in scope, some of whom have greater financial resources than we do. We face competition:\n•\nfor suitable and desirable lots at acceptable prices;\n•\nfrom selling incentives offered by competing builders within and across developments; and\n•\nfrom the existing home resale market.\nOur homebuilding operations compete primarily on the basis of price, location, design, quality, service and reputation.\nThe mortgage banking industry is also competitive. Our main competition comes from national, regional and local mortgage bankers, credit unions, banks and mortgage brokers in each of these markets. Our mortgage banking operations compete primarily on the basis of customer service, variety of products offered, interest rates offered, prices of ancillary services and relative financing availability and costs.\nWe might not be able to continue to compete successfully in our homebuilding or mortgage banking operations. An inability to effectively compete may have an adverse impact on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nOur inability to secure and control an adequate inventory of lots could adversely impact our operations.\nThe results of our homebuilding operations depend upon our continuing ability to control an adequate number of homebuilding lots in desirable locations. There can be no assurance that an adequate supply of building lots will continue to be available to us on terms similar to those available in the past, or that we will not be required to devote a greater amount of capital to controlling building lots than we have historically. An insufficient supply of building lots in one or more of our markets, an inability of our developers to deliver finished lots in a timely fashion due to their inability to secure financing to fund development activities or for other reasons, or our inability to purchase or finance building lots on reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nA shortage of building materials or labor, or increases in materials or labor costs may adversely impact our operations.\nThe homebuilding business has from time to time experienced building material and labor shortages, including fluctuating lumber prices and supply. In addition, strong construction market conditions could restrict the labor force available to our subcontractors and us in one or more of our markets. Significant increases in costs resulting from these shortages, or delays in construction of homes, could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nWe rely on subcontractors to construct our homes. The failure of our subcontractors to properly construct our homes may be costly.\nWe engage subcontractors to perform the actual construction of our homes. Despite our quality control efforts, we may discover that our subcontractors have engaged in improper construction practices. The occurrence of such events could require us to repair the homes in accordance with our standards and as required by law. The cost of satisfying our legal obligations in these instances may be significant, and we may be unable to recover the cost of repair from subcontractors, suppliers and insurers.\nProduct liability litigation and warranty claims may adversely impact our operations.\nConstruction defect and home warranty claims are common and can represent a substantial risk for the homebuilding industry. The cost of insuring against construction defect and product liability claims, as well as the claims themselves, can be high. In addition, insurance companies limit coverage offered to protect against these claims. Further restrictions on coverage availability, or significant increases in premium costs or claims, could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe are subject to litigation proceedings that could harm our business if an unfavorable ruling were to occur.\nFrom time to time, we are involved in litigation and other legal proceedings relating to claims arising from our operations in the normal course of business. As described in, but not limited to, Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” of this Form 10-K, we are currently subject to certain legal proceedings. Litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings may occur. These or other litigation or legal proceedings could materially affect our ability to conduct our business in the manner that we expect or otherwise adversely affect us should an unfavorable ruling occur.\nIf the underwriting quality of our mortgage originations is found to be deficient, our profit could decrease and we may incur losses.\nWe originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home. We sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market generally within 30 days from the date of closing. All of the loans that we originate are\n6\nunderwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards, we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur. In the event that a substantial number of the loans that we have originated fall into default and the investors to whom we sold the loans determine that we did not underwrite the loans in accordance with their requirements, we could be required to repurchase the loans from the investor or indemnify the investor for any losses incurred. Any resulting losses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nWe may be subject to claims on mortgage loans sold to third parties.\nOur mortgage banking operations may be responsible for losses associated with mortgage loans originated and sold to investors in the event of errors or omissions relating to certain representations and warranties that the loans sold meet certain requirements, including representations as to underwriting standards, the type of collateral, the existence of private mortgage insurance, and the validity of certain borrower representations in connection with the loan. The resolution of claims related to alleged breaches of these representations and warranties and repurchase claims could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations and could result in losses that exceed existing estimates and accruals. Because of the uncertainties inherent in estimating these matters, there can be no assurance that any amounts reserved will be adequate or that any potential inadequacies will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations.\nThe loss of key personnel could adversely impact our business.\nWe rely on our key personnel to effectively operate and manage our business.  Specifically, our future success depends heavily on the performance of our senior management team.  Our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract qualified personnel to manage our business.\nOur failure to maintain the security of our electronic and other confidential information could expose us to liability and materially adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nPrivacy, security, and compliance concerns have continued to increase as technology has evolved. As part of our normal business activities, we collect and store certain confidential information, including personal information of homebuyers/borrowers and information about employees, vendors and suppliers. This information is entitled to protection under a number of federal and state laws. We may share some of this information with vendors who assist us with certain aspects of our business, particularly our mortgage and title businesses.\nWe have implemented systems and processes intended to secure our information technology systems and prevent unauthorized access to or loss of sensitive, confidential and personal data, including through the use of encryption and authentication technologies.  Additionally, we have continued to elevate our monitoring capabilities to enhance early detection and rapid response to potential security anomalies. In 2021, we had an external review of our cybersecurity program performed by a third party, which allowed us to enhance our overall program.  We also require employees to complete training sessions regarding matters such as cybersecurity threats and data protection on a regular basis. These security measures may not be sufficient for all possible occurrences and may be vulnerable to hacking, employee error, malfeasance, system error, faulty password management or other irregularities.  Further, development and maintenance of these measures are costly and require ongoing monitoring and updating as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures become increasingly sophisticated.\nOur failure to maintain the security of the data we are required to protect, including via the penetration of our network security and the misappropriation of confidential and personal information, could result in business disruption, damage to our reputation, financial obligations to third parties, fines, penalties, regulatory proceedings and private litigation with potentially large costs, and also in deterioration in customers’ confidence in us and other competitive disadvantages, and thus could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nVolatility in the credit and capital markets may impact our ability to access necessary financing.\nIf we require working capital greater than that provided by our operations and our credit facility, we may be required to seek to increase the amount available under the facility or seek alternative financing, which might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable. If we are required to seek financing to fund our working capital requirements, volatility in credit or capital markets may restrict our flexibility to access financing. If we are at any time unsuccessful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund our planned homebuilding expenditures, we may experience a substantial delay in the completion of homes then under construction, or we may be unable to control or purchase finished building lots. Any delay could result in cost increases and could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nOur mortgage banking operations depend in part on the availability, cost and other terms of mortgage financing facilities, and may be adversely affected by any shortage or increased cost of such financing. Additional or replacement financing might not be available on terms that are favorable or acceptable. Our mortgage banking operations are also dependent upon the securitization market for mortgage-backed securities, and could be materially adversely affected by any fluctuation or downturn in such market.\n7\nOur current indebtedness may impact our future operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021 we had $1.5 billion in senior notes outstanding.  Our existing indebtedness contains restrictive covenants and any future indebtedness may also contain such covenants. These covenants include, or could include, restrictions on our ability to create, incur, assume or guarantee secured debt, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers and/or the sale of assets. Substantial losses by us or other action or inaction by us or our subsidiaries could result in the violation of one or more of these covenants, which could result in decreased liquidity or a default on our current or future indebtedness, thereby having a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nRegulatory Risk\nGovernment regulations and environmental matters could negatively affect our operations.\nWe are subject to various local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning zoning, building design, construction and similar matters, including local regulations that impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular area. These regulations may further increase the cost to produce and market our products. In addition, we have from time to time been subject to, and may also be subject in the future to, periodic delays in our homebuilding projects due to building moratoriums in the areas in which we operate or delays in receiving the necessary governmental approvals. Changes in regulations that restrict homebuilding activities in one or more of our principal markets could have a material adverse effect on our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nIn addition, new housing developments are often subject to various assessments or impact fees for schools, parks, streets, highways and other public improvements. The cost of these assessments is subject to substantial change and could cause increases in the construction cost of our homes, which, in turn, could reduce our profitability.\nWe are also subject to a variety of local, state and federal statutes, ordinances, rules and regulations concerning the protection of health and the environment. We are subject to a variety of environmental conditions that can affect our business and our homebuilding projects. The particular environmental laws that apply to any given homebuilding site vary greatly according to the location and environmental condition of the site and the present and former uses of the site and adjoining properties. Environmental laws and conditions may result in delays, cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs, or prohibit or severely restrict homebuilding activity in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas, thereby adversely affecting our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nIncreased regulation of the mortgage industry could harm our future sales and earnings.\nThe mortgage industry remains under intense scrutiny and continues to face increasing regulation at the federal, state and local level. Potential changes to federal laws and regulations could have the effect of limiting the activities of FNMA and FHLMC, the entities that provide liquidity to the secondary mortgage market, which could lead to increases in mortgage interest rates. Tighter underwriting requirements and fee restrictions and the increasingly complex regulatory environment may negatively impact our mortgage loan origination business in the form of lower demand, decreased revenue and increased operating costs.\nWe are an approved seller/servicer of FNMA and FHLMC mortgage loans and an approved seller/issuer of GNMA, VA and FHA mortgage loans, and are subject to all of those agencies’ rules and regulations. Any significant impairment of our eligibility to sell/service these loans could have a material adverse impact on our mortgage operations. In addition, we are subject to regulation at the state and federal level with respect to specific origination, selling and servicing practices including the Real Estate Settlement and Protection Act. Adverse changes in governmental regulation may have a negative impact on our mortgage loan origination business.\nRisks Related to the COVID-19 Pandemic and Other External Risks\nHealth epidemics, including the recent COVID-19 pandemic, have had, and could in the future have, an adverse impact on our business and operations, and the markets, states and local communities in which we operate.\nOur business and operations could be adversely affected by health epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic, impacting the markets, states and local communities in which we operate.\nGeneral uncertainty continues regarding the near-term and long-term impact of the COVID-19 virus on the domestic and international economy and on public health. These developments and other consequences of the outbreak could materially and adversely affect our operations, profitability and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on all facets of our business.  Ou\nr primary focus during the pandemic has been to do everything we can to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, customers and trade partners.  In each of our markets, we continue to operate\nin accordance with the guidelines issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as well as state and local guidelines.\n8\nThe ultimate impact of the COVID-19 pandemic or a similar health epidemic is highly uncertain and subject to change.  There is uncertainty regarding governmental actions that may occur, and the effects of economic relief efforts on the U.S. economy, either of which could be potential disruptors to our business. Over the long term, these disruptions related to COVID-19 could lower demand for our products, impair our ability to sell and/or build homes in our normal manner, increase our losses on contract land deposits, and negatively impact our lending and secondary mortgage market activities.\nWhile the spread of COVID-19 may eventually be mitigated, there is no guarantee that a future outbreak of this or any other widespread epidemics will not occur, or that the U.S. economy will recover, either of which could seriously harm our business.\nWeather-related and other events beyond our control may adversely impact our operations.\nExtreme weather or other events, such as significant snowfalls, hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, forest fires, floods, terrorist attacks or war may affect our markets, our operations and our profitability. These events may impact our physical facilities or those of our suppliers or subcontractors and our housing inventories, causing us material increases in costs, or delays in construction of homes, which could have a material adverse effect upon our sales, profitability, stock performance, ability to service our debt obligations and future cash flows.\nOur continued success is dependent on positive perceptions of us and our brands which, if eroded, could adversely affect our business and our relationships with our customers.\nWe believe that one of the reasons our customers buy from us, our employees choose NVR as a place of employment, and our vendors choose to do business with us is the reputation we have built over many years. To be successful in the future, we must continue to preserve our reputation. Reputational value is based in large part on perceptions, and broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of the brands under which we do business. It may be difficult to control negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. While reputations may take decades to build, negative incidents can quickly erode trust and confidence, could damage our reputation, reduce the demand for our homes or negatively impact the morale and performance of our employees, all of which could adversely affect our business."

    "text": "(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nResults of Operations\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nOverview\nBusiness Environment and Current Outlook\nDemand for new homes remained strong across each of our markets throughout 2021, driven by historically low mortgage rates and limited housing supply.  As a result, we were able to consistently increase prices throughout the year, allowing us to improve profitability despite rising lumber and other material costs and labor costs.  Additionally, strong housing demand has resulted in increased construction activity and demand for building materials and contractor labor, which, coupled with the ongoing effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, has led to supply chain disruptions and longer construction cycle times.  We expect to continue to face these disruptions well into 2022 and continue to work closely with our suppliers and trade partners to manage these disruptions.\nAlthough current demand for new homes is strong, there is uncertainty regarding the extent and timing of the supply chain disruption and the effects of the ongoing pandemic and related economic relief efforts on the U.S. economy, inflation, unemployment, consumer confidence, demand for new homes and home affordability. We expect to continue to face cost pressures related to building materials, particularly lumber, as well as labor and land costs. As a result, profit margins will be impacted based on our ability to manage these costs while balancing sales pace and pricing.  Although we are unable to predict the extent to which this will impact our operational and financial performance, we believe that we are well positioned to take advantage of opportunities that may arise from future economic and homebuilding market volatility due to the strength of our balance sheet.\nBusiness\nOur primary business is the construction and sale of single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings, all of which are primarily constructed on a pre-sold basis. To fully serve customers of our homebuilding operations, we also operate a mortgage banking and title services business. We primarily conduct our operations in mature markets. Additionally, we generally grow our business through market share gains in our existing markets and by expanding into markets contiguous to our current active markets. Our four homebuilding reportable segments consist of the following regions:\nOur lot acquisition strategy is predicated upon avoiding the financial risks associated with direct land ownership and development. We generally do not engage in land development (see discussion below of our land development activities). Instead, we typically acquire finished lots from various third party land developers pursuant to LPAs. These LPAs require deposits, typically ranging up to 10% of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots, in the form of cash or letters of credit that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the LPA. This strategy has allowed us to maximize inventory turnover, which we believe enables us to minimize market risk and to operate with less capital, thereby enhancing rates of return on equity and total capital.\nIn addition to constructing homes primarily on a pre-sold basis and utilizing what we believe is a conservative lot acquisition strategy, we focus on obtaining and maintaining a leading market position in each market we serve. This strategy allows us to gain valuable efficiencies and competitive advantages in our markets, which we believe contributes to minimizing the adverse effects of regional economic cycles and provides growth opportunities within these markets. Our continued success is contingent upon our ability to control an adequate supply of finished lots on which to build.\nIn limited specific strategic circumstances, we deviate from our historical lot acquisition strategy and engage in joint venture arrangements with land developers or directly acquire raw ground already zoned for its intended use for development. Once we acquire control of raw ground, we determine whether to sell the raw parcel to a developer and enter into an LPA with the developer to purchase the finished lots or to hire a developer to develop the land on our behalf. While joint venture arrangements and direct land development activity are not our preferred method of acquiring finished building lots, we may enter into additional transactions in the future on a limited basis where there exists a compelling strategic or prudent financial reason to do so. We expect, however, to continue to acquire substantially all of our finished lot inventory using LPAs with forfeitable deposits.\n12\nAs of December 31, 2021, we controlled approximately 124,900 lots as discussed below.\nLot Purchase Agreements (\"LPAs\")\nWe controlled approximately 122,800 lots under LPAs with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately $521,900 and $10,100, respectively. Included in the number of controlled lots are approximately 4,900 lots for which we have recorded a contract land deposit impairment reserve of approximately $30,000 as of December 31, 2021.\nJoint Venture Limited Liability Corporations (“JVs”)\nWe had an aggregate investment totaling approximately $20,300 in four JVs, expected to produce approximately 2,300 lots. Of the lots to be produced by the JVs, approximately 1,900 lots were controlled by us and approximately 400 lots were either under contract with unrelated parties or currently not under contract.\nLand Under Development\nWe owned land with a carrying value of approximately $12,100 that we intend to develop into approximately 200 finished lots. We had additional funding commitments of approximately $2,700 under a joint development agreement related to one project, a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately $800.\nSee Notes 3, 4 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements included herein for additional information regarding LPAs, JVs and land under development, respectively.\nRaw Land Purchase Agreements\nIn addition to the lots we currently control as discussed above, we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately 15,500 lots. Some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield. These properties are controlled with cash deposits totaling approximately $5,300 as of December 31, 2021, of which approximately $3,400 is refundable if we do not perform under the contract. We generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into an LPA with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible.\nKey Financial Results\nOur consolidated revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled $8,951,025, an increase of 19% from $7,536,923 in 2020. Our net income for 2021 was $1,236,719, or $320.48 per diluted share, increases of 37% and 39% compared to 2020 net income and diluted earnings per share, respectively. Our homebuilding gross profit margin percentage was 22.3% in 2021 compared to 19.0% in 2020. Settlements for the year ended December 31, 2021 totaled 21,540 units, an increase of 9% from 2020.  New orders, net of cancellations (“New Orders”) during 2021 were 22,721, a decrease of 2% from 2020 while our average New Order sales price increased 15% to $436.1 in 2021. Our backlog of homes sold but not yet settled with the customer as of December 31, 2021 increased on a unit basis by 10% to 12,730 units and increased on a dollar basis by 26% to $5,782,035 when compared to December 31, 2020. Income before tax from our mortgage banking segment totaled $171,604 in 2021, an increase of 23% when compared to $140,073 in 2020 due primarily to an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans.\nHomebuilding Operations\nThe following table summarizes the results of our consolidated homebuilding operations and certain operating activity for each of the last three years:\n13\nConsolidated Homebuilding\nHomebuilding revenues increased 19% in 2021 compared to 2020, as a result of a 9% increase in both the number of units settled and in the average settlement price year over year.  The increase in the number of units settled was attributable to a 40% higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2020, offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year.  The increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 4% higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to backlog entering 2020 coupled with a 15% increase in the average sales price of New Orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.  The gross profit margin percentage in 2021 increased to 22.3% from 19.0% in 2020\n.\nGross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power in prior quarters and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year.  These favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber, certain other commodities and labor year over year.\nThe number of New Orders decreased 2% while the average sales price of New Orders increased 15% in 2021 when compared to 2020.  The number of New Orders in the current year were lower due primarily to a 9% decrease in the average number of active communities year over year.  The increase in the average sales price of New Orders was primarily attributable to favorable market conditions which, coupled with low housing inventory levels, drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020.\nSelling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\") expenses in 2021 increased by $43,800 compared to 2020, but as a percentage of revenue decreased to 5.5% in 2021 from 5.9% in 2020 due to improved leveraging of SG&A costs.  The increase in SG&A expense year over year was attributable primarily to increased incentive compensation attributable to stronger performance year over year, as well as increased personnel costs due to increased headcount.\nOur backlog represents homes sold but not yet settled with our customers.  Backlog units and dollars were 12,730 units and $5,782,035, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 compared to 11,549 units and $4,575,899, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.  Backlog units were higher despite an 11% decrease in New Orders during the six-month period ending December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, due to a lower backlog turnover rate year over year.  Our backlog turnover rate was negatively impacted by a longer production cycle attributable to supply chain disruptions and subcontractor capacity constraints.  Backlog dollars were higher due to a 15% increase in the average sales price of New Orders during the six-month period ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.\nIn addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our backlog may be impacted by customer cancellations for various reasons that are beyond our control, such as failure to obtain mortgage financing, inability to sell an existing home, job loss, or a variety of other reasons.  In any period, a portion of the cancellations that we experience are related to new sales that occurred during the same period, and a portion are related to sales that occurred in prior periods and therefore appeared in the beginning backlog for the current period.  Additionally, a substantial majority of our cancellations occur prior to starting construction on a home. Expressed as the total of all cancellations during the period as a percentage of gross New Orders during the period, our cancellation rate was 9.2%, 14.9% and 14.6% in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Additionally, approximately 3% in  2021 and 6% in both 2020 and 2019, of a reporting quarter’s opening backlog cancelled during the quarter.  We can provide no assurance that our historical cancellation rates are indicative of the actual cancellation rate that may occur in future years. Other than those units that are cancelled, and subject to potential construction delays resulting from COVID-19 related restrictions and/or continued supply chain disruptions, we expect to settle substantially all of our December 31, 2021 backlog during 2022. See “Risk Factors” in Item 1A of this Form 10-K.\nThe backlog turnover rate is impacted by various factors, including, but not limited to, changes in New Order activity, internal production capacity, external subcontractor capacity and other external factors over which we do not exercise control.\nReportable Homebuilding Segments\nHomebuilding segment profit includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes, less the cost of homes sold, SG&A expenses, and a corporate capital allocation charge determined by corporate management. The corporate capital allocation charge eliminates in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed. The corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the Chief Operating Decision Maker to determine whether the operating segment is providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital.\nWe record impairment charges on contract land deposits when we determine that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired. For segment reporting purposes, impairments on contract land deposits are generally charged to the operating segment upon the termination of an LPA with the developer, or the restructuring of an LPA resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit. We evaluate our entire net contract land deposit portfolio for impairment each quarter.  For presentation purposes below, the contract land deposit reserve at December 31, 2021 and 2020 has been allocated to the reportable segments for the respective years to show contract land deposits on a net basis. The net contract land deposit balances below also include approximately $10,100 and $8,100 at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, of letters of credit issued as deposits in lieu of cash.\n14\nThe following tables summarize certain homebuilding operating activity by reportable segment for each of the last three years:\nSelected Segment Financial Data:\nSegment Operating Activity:\n15\nOperating Data:\nHomebuilding Inventory:\n16\n(1)\nTotal segment inventory differs from consolidated inventory due to certain consolidation adjustments necessary to convert the reportable segments’ results, which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis, to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes.  These consolidation adjustments are not allocated to our operating segments.\nLots Controlled and Land Deposits:\nMid Atlantic\nThe Mid Atlantic segment had an approximate $297,100, or 68%, increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by improved gross profit margins and an increase in segment revenues of approximately $381,300, or 10%, year over year. Segment revenues increased due primarily to an 11% increase in the average settlement price year over year.  The increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 7% higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to backlog entering 2020, coupled with a 17% increase in the average sales price of New Orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The Mid Atlantic segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 24.4% in 2021 from 18.8% in 2020. Gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year.  These favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber, certain other commodities and labor year over year.\n17\nSegment New Orders decreased 5% while the average sales price of New Orders increased 15% in 2021 compared to 2020.  New Orders were negatively impacted primarily by a 13% decrease in the average number of active communities year over year.  The increase in the average sales price of New Orders year over year was attributable to favorable market conditions which, coupled with low housing inventory levels, drove demand and have provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020.\nNorth East\nThe North East segment had an approximate $54,800, or 108%, increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by an increase in segment revenues of approximately $229,100, or 43%, year over year and improved gross profit margins. The increase in segment revenues was attributable to a 21% increase in the number of units settled and an 18% increase in the average settlement price year over year. The increase in the number of units settled was attributable to a 62% higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2020, offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year.  The increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 10% higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to backlog entering 2020, coupled with a 28% increase in the average sales price of New Orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 21.4% in 2021 from 19.0% in 2020.  Gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year.  These favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber, certain other commodities and labor year over year.\nSegment New Orders decreased 3% while the average sales price of New Orders increased 19% in 2021 compared to 2020. New Orders were negatively impacted primarily by a 13% decrease in the average number of active communities year over year.\nThe increase in the average sales price of New Orders year over year was attributable to favorable market conditions which, coupled with low housing inventory levels, drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020.\nMid East\nThe Mid East segment had an approximate $103,200, or 61%, increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in segment profit was driven by an increase of segment revenues of approximately $367,100, or 24%, year over year and improved gross profit margins. Segment revenues increased due to increases in the number of units settled and the average settlement price of 15% and 8%, respectively, year over year. The increase in the number of units settled was largely attributable to a 59% higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the backlog unit balance entering 2020, offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year. The increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 4% higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, coupled with a 13% increase in the average sales price of New Orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020.  The segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 20.7% in 2021 from 18.5% in 2020. Gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and by improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year, offset partially by higher prices for lumber, certain other commodities and labor year over year.\nSegment New Orders decreased 4% while the average sales price of New Orders increased 12% in 2021 compared to 2020.  New Orders were negatively impacted primarily by a 7% decrease in the average number of active communities in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in the average sales price of New Orders was attributable to favorable market conditions which, coupled with low housing inventory levels, drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020.\nSouth East\nThe South East segment had an approximate $125,000, or 61%, increase in segment profit in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in segment profit was primarily driven by an increase in segment revenues of approximately $395,400, or 25%, year over year and improved gross profit margins. The increase in revenues was attributable to a 16% increase in the number of units settled and an 8% increase in the average settlement price year over year. The number of units settled were favorably impacted by a 46% higher backlog unit balance entering 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, offset partially by a lower backlog turnover rate year over year. The increase in the average settlement price was primarily attributable to a 3% higher average sales price of units in backlog entering 2021 compared to the same period in 2020, coupled with a 16% increase in the average sales price of New Orders in the first six months of 2021 compared to the same period in 2020. The segment’s gross profit margin percentage increased to 23.6% in 2021 from 20.5% in 2020.  Gross profit margins were favorably impacted by the increase in the average settlement price attributable to improved pricing power and improved leveraging of certain operating costs attributable to the increase in settlement activity year over year.  These favorable factors were partially offset by higher prices for lumber, certain other commodities and labor year over year.\nSegment New Orders and the average sales price of New Orders increased 6% and 18%, respectively, in 2021 compared to 2020. New Orders and the average sales price of New Orders were higher due to favorable market conditions which, coupled with low housing inventory levels, drove demand and provided us sustained pricing power since the second half of 2020.\n18\nHomebuilding Segment Reconciliations to Consolidated Homebuilding Operations\nIn addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above, the other reconciling items between homebuilding segment profit and homebuilding consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead (which includes all management incentive compensation), equity-based compensation expense, consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense. Our overhead functions, such as accounting, treasury and human resources, are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments. Consolidation adjustments consist of such items to convert the reportable segments’ results, which are predominantly maintained on a cash basis, to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes, and are not allocated to our operating segments. External corporate interest expense is primarily comprised of interest charges on our 3.95% Senior Notes due 2022 and 3.00% Senior Notes due 2030, and is not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above.\n(1)\nThis item represents changes to the contract land deposit impairment reserve, which are not allocated to the reportable segments.  See further discussion of contract land deposit impairment charges in Note 3 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n(2)\nThe decrease in equity-based compensation expense in 2020 was primarily attributable to stock options issued in 2014 under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan becoming fully vested in 2019. In addition, there were higher stock option forfeitures in 2020 compared to 2019.\n(3)\nThis item represents the elimination of the corporate capital allocation charge included in the respective homebuilding reportable segments. The corporate capital allocation charge is based on the segment’s monthly average asset balance and is as follows for the years presented:\n19\n(4)      The decrease in consolidation adjustments and other in 2021 compared to 2020 is driven by changes in lumber prices in 2021. Our reportable segments' results include intercompany profits of our production facilities for home packages delivered to our homebuilding divisions.  For homes not yet settled, these intercompany profits are reversed through the consolidation adjustments. Due to the significantly higher lumber prices in the first half of 2021, the previously reversed intercompany profits were recognized in subsequent quarters through the consolidation adjustment as homes were settled, and our consolidated homebuilding margins were negatively impacted by the higher lumber costs.\nMortgage Banking Segment\nWe conduct our mortgage banking activity through NVRM, a wholly owned subsidiary. NVRM focuses almost exclusively on serving the homebuilding segment customer base. The following table summarizes the results of our mortgage banking operations and certain statistical data for each of the last three years:\nLoan closing volume in 2021 increased by approximately $756,100, or 14%, from 2020.  The increase was primarily attributable to a 6% increase in the number of loans closed year over year due primarily to the aforementioned increase in the homebuilding segment’s number of settlements in 2021 as compared to 2020 and an 8% increase in the average loan amount in 2021 compared to 2020.\nSegment profit in 2021 increased by approximately $32,900, or 23%, from 2020.  The increase in segment profit was primarily attributable to an increase in mortgage banking fees.  Mortgage banking fees increased by approximately $41,300, or 20%, resulting from the aforementioned increase in loan closing volume and an increase in secondary marketing gains on sales of loans.\n20\nMortgage Banking – Other\nWe sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market.  Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor, we have no further financial obligations from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur.  Those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA.  Because we sell all of our loans and do not service them, there is often a substantial delay between the time that a loan goes into default and the time that the investor requests us to reimburse them for losses incurred because of the default.  We believe that all of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor to whom we sell our originated loans.  We employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effective, and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting.\nWe maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure from the loans that we have originated and sold. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had repurchase reserves of approximately $21,400 and $20,500, respectively.\nNVRM is dependent on our homebuilding operation’s customers for business.  If new orders and selling prices of the homebuilding segment decline, NVRM’s operations will also be adversely affected.  In addition, NVRM’s operating results may be adversely affected in future periods due to tightening and volatility of the credit markets, changes in investor funding times, increased regulation of mortgage lending practices and increased competition in the mortgage market.\nSeasonality\nWe generally have higher New Order activity in the first half of the year and higher home settlements, revenues and net income in the second half of the year, however, the impact of the pandemic in both 2021 and 2020 on home demand, as well as supply chain disruptions, have affected our typical seasonal New Order and settlement trends.\nEffective Tax Rate\nOur consolidated effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 were 22.24% and 16.40%, respectively. The higher effective tax rate in 2021 was attributable primarily to the recognition of a lower income tax benefit related to excess tax benefits from stock option exercises in 2021. Excess tax benefit recognized in 2021 and 2020 were approximately $48,400 and $92,200, respectively.\nWe expect continued tax rate volatility in future years attributable to the recognition of excess tax benefits from equity plan activity and distributions from the deferred compensation plans.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Pending Adoption\nSee Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of recently issued accounting pronouncements applicable to us.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe fund our operations primarily from our current cash holdings and cash flows generated by operating activities.  In addition, we have available a short-term unsecured working capital revolving credit facility and revolving mortgage repurchase facility, as further described below. As of December 31, 2021, we had a strong liquidity position with approximately $2,600,000 in cash and cash equivalents, approximately $284,000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving credit facility and $150,000 in unused committed capacity under our revolving mortgage repurchase facility.\nMaterial Cash Requirements\nWe believe that our current cash holdings, cash generated from operations, and cash available under our short-term unsecured credit agreement and revolving mortgage repurchase facility, as well as the public debt and equity markets, will be sufficient to satisfy both our short term and long term cash requirements for working capital to support our daily operations and meet commitments under our contractual obligations with third parties.  Our material contractual obligations primarily consist of (i) payments due to service our debt and interest on that debt.  During 2022, we expect to use cash holdings to repurchase or retire $600,000 in senior notes maturing in September 2022.  Future interest payments on our outstanding senior notes total approximately $242,800, with approximately $43,700 due within twelve months, (ii) payment obligations totaling approximately $300,000 under existing LPAs for deposits to be paid to land developers, assuming that contractual development milestones are met by the developers and we exercise our option to acquire finished lots under those LPAs. We expect to make the majority of these payments within the next three years, and (iii) obligations under operating and finance leases related primarily to office space and our production facilities (see Part I, Item 2 and Note 13 of this Form 10-K for additional discussion of our properties and leases, respectively).\n21\nIn addition to funding growth in our homebuilding and mortgage banking operations, we historically have used a substantial portion of our excess liquidity to repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock in open market and privately negotiated transactions. This ongoing repurchase program assists us in accomplishing our primary objective, creating increases in shareholder value. See “Market for Registrant’s Common Equity, Related Stockholder Matters and Issuer Purchases of Equity Securities” in Item 5 of this Form 10-K for disclosure of amounts repurchased during the fourth quarter of 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased 322,038 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $1,538,019. As of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $508,000 available under Board approved repurchase authorizations.\nCapital Resources\nSenior Notes\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had a total of $1,500,000 in outstanding Senior Notes, $600,000 of which mature in September 2022 and the remaining $900,000 mature in May 2030.  The Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Senior Notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Notes does not contain any financial covenants; however, it does contain, among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict our ability to create, incur, assume or guarantee secured debt, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers and/or the sale of assets. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Notes at December 31, 2021.\nCredit Agreement\nWe have a unsecured revolving credit agreement (the \"Credit Agreement\") with a group of lenders which may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of $300,000 (the \"Facility\").  Under the Credit Agreement, we may request increases of up to $300,000 to the Facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments.  In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $100,000 sublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which there was approximately $16,100 outstanding at December 31, 2021. The Credit Agreement termination date is February 12, 2026. There were no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021.\nRepurchase Agreement\nOur mortgage banking subsidiary, NVRM, has an unsecured revolving mortgage repurchase agreement (the \"Repurchase Agreement\") which is non-recourse to NVR. The purpose of the Repurchase Agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by NVRM. The Repurchase Agreement provides borrowing capacity up to $150,000, subject to certain sublimits. The Repurchase Agreement expires on July 20, 2022.  At December 31, 2021, there was no debt outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement and there were no borrowing base limitations.\nSee Note 9 of this Form 10-K for additional disclosures regarding our Senior Notes, Credit Agreement and Repurchase Agreement.\nCash Flows\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents decreased by $172,798. Net cash provided by operating activities was $1,242,393, due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2021 and net proceeds of $344,750 from mortgage loan activity.  Additionally, cash was provided by an increase in customer deposits of $176,705 attributable to the increase in our ending backlog year over year. Cash was primarily used to fund the increase in inventory of $238,284, attributable to an increase in units under construction at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2021 was $18,179. Cash was used primarily for purchases of property, plant and equipment.\nNet cash used by financing activities in 2021 was $1,397,012.  Cash was used primarily to repurchase shares of our common stock under our ongoing common stock repurchase program as discussed above. Cash was provided from stock option exercise proceeds totaling $142,370.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, cash, restricted cash and cash equivalents increased by $1,648,978. Net cash provided by operating activities was $925,269, due primarily to cash provided by earnings in 2020 and net proceeds of $212,636 from mortgage loan activity. Additionally, cash was provided by an increase in customer deposits attributable to the increase in our ending backlog year over year. Cash was primarily used to fund the increase in inventory of $362,384, attributable to an increase in units under construction at December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities in 2020 of $3,933 was primarily used for purchases of property, plant and equipment of $16,119, offset partially by the receipt of capital distributions from our unconsolidated JVs totaling $11,625.\n22\nNet cash provided by financing activities in 2020 was $727,642, due primarily to the net proceeds received from the issuance of the 2030 Senior Notes totaling $923,905 and by $180,866 in proceeds from stock option exercises in 2020. Cash was used during the period to repurchase 93,346 shares of our common stock at an aggregate purchase price of $371,078 under our ongoing common stock repurchase program discussed above.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the homebuilding segment had restricted cash of $60,730 and $28,912, respectively. Restricted cash in each year was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nGeneral\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. We continually evaluate the estimates we use to prepare the consolidated financial statements and update those estimates as necessary. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management.\nHomebuilding Inventory\nThe carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units. Field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs. Interest costs are not capitalized into inventory, with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments, as applicable. Upon settlement, the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis. Cost of building materials is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nSold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual sales price compared to the total estimated cost to construct. Unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete. Any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales.\nContract Land Deposits\nWe purchase finished lots under LPAs that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract. The deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period. To analyze contract land deposit impairments, we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter. In addition to considering market and economic conditions, we assess contract land deposit impairments on a community-by-community basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms, analyzing quantitative and qualitative information including, as applicable, current sales absorption levels, recent sales’ profit margin, the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots, a developer’s performance, a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices, if necessary, and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default.\nOur analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced. Because we do not own the finished lots on which we had placed a contract land deposit, if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price, we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract, forfeit our deposit and terminate the contract, or whether we will attempt to restructure the LPA, which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract concessions from a developer. We also assess whether an impairment is present due to collectability issues resulting from a developer’s non-performance because of financial or other conditions.\nAlthough we consider the allowance for losses on contract land deposits reflected on the December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate (see Note 1 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein), there can be no assurance that this allowance will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated adverse changes in the economy or other events adversely affecting specific markets or the homebuilding industry.\nWarranty/Product Liability Reserves\nWe establish warranty and product liability reserves to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business. Liability estimates are determined based on our judgment considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and\n23\nsubcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with our General Counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases. Although we consider the warranty and product liability accrual reflected on the December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate (see Note 14 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein), there can be no assurance that this accrual will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to increased costs for material and labor, the inability or refusal of manufacturers or subcontractors to financially participate in corrective action, unanticipated adverse legal settlements, or other unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the warranty and product liability accrual.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe recognize equity-based compensation expense within our income statement for all share-based payment arrangements, which include non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of NVR common stock (\"Options\") and restricted share units (\"RSUs\"). Compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value of the Options and RSUs granted, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award (from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant). Options and RSUs which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “service-only” Options and RSUs, and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved. We calculate the fair value of our Options, which are non-publicly traded, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant. The reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs.\nAs noted above, we calculate the fair value of our Options, which are non-publicly traded, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. While the Black-Scholes model is a widely accepted method to calculate the fair value of options, its results are dependent on input variables, two of which, expected term and expected volatility, are significantly dependent on management’s judgment. We have concluded that our historical exercise experience is the best estimate of future exercise patterns to determine an Option’s expected term. To estimate expected volatility, we analyze the historical volatility of our common stock over a period equal to the Option’s expected term. Changes in management’s judgment of the expected term and the expected volatility could have a material effect on the grant-date fair value calculated and expensed within the income statement.\nIn addition, when recognizing equity-based compensation cost related to “performance condition” Option and RSU grants, we are required to make a determination as to whether the performance conditions will be met prior to the completion of the actual performance period.  The performance metric is based on our return on capital performance during a specified three year period based on the date of Option grant. While we currently believe that this performance condition will be satisfied at the target level and are recognizing compensation expense related to such Options and RSUs accordingly, our future expected activity levels could cause us to make a different determination, resulting in a change to the compensation expense to be recognized related to performance condition Option and RSU grants that would otherwise have been recognized to date.\nAlthough we believe that the compensation costs recognized in 2021 are representative of the cumulative ratable amortization of the grant-date fair value of unvested Options and RSUs outstanding, changes to the estimated input values such as expected term and expected volatility and changes to the determination of whether performance condition grants will vest, could produce widely different expense valuations and recognition.\nMortgage Repurchase Reserve\nWe originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of their home. We sell all of the loans we originate into the secondary mortgage market, on a servicing released basis, typically within 30 days from closing. All of the loans that we originate are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by FNMA, GNMA, FHLMC, VA and FHA. Insofar as we underwrite our originated loans to those standards, we bear no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur. We employ a quality control department to ensure that our underwriting controls are effectively operating, and further assess the underwriting function as part of our assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. We maintain a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that we have originated and sold. The reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure. Although we consider the mortgage repurchase reserve reflected on the December 31, 2021 consolidated balance sheet to be adequate (see Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein), there can be no assurance that this reserve will prove to be adequate over time to cover losses due to unanticipated changes to the assumptions used to estimate the mortgage repurchase reserve.\nImpact of Inflation, Changing Prices and Economic Conditions\nSee “Risk Factors” included in Item 1A of this Form 10-K for a description of the impact of inflation, changing prices and economic conditions on our business and our financial results. See also the discussion of the current business environment in the\nOverview\nsection above.\n24"

    "text": "(dollars in thousands)\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and interest rates. Our market risk arises from interest rate risk inherent in our financial instruments and debt obligations. Interest rate risk results from the possibility that changes in interest rates will cause unfavorable changes in net income or in the value of interest rate-sensitive assets, liabilities and commitments. Lower interest rates tend to increase demand for mortgage loans for home purchasers, while higher interest rates make it more difficult for potential borrowers to purchase residential properties and to qualify for mortgage loans. We have no market rate sensitive instruments held for speculative or trading purposes.\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to our fixed rate debt, primarily our Senior Notes and our variable rate credit facility and loan repurchase facility.  Changes to interest rates generally affect the fair value of fixed-rate debt instruments, but not earnings or cash flows. For variable rate debt, interest rate changes generally will not affect the fair value of the variable debt instruments but will affect earnings and cash flow.  At December 31, 2021, there was no debt outstanding under our credit facility or loan repurchase facility.  See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further  discussion of these debt instruments.\nOur mortgage banking segment is exposed to interest rate risk as it relates to its lending activities, including originating mortgage loans and providing rate lock commitments to borrowers. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, we enter into optional or mandatory delivery forward sales contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage-backed securities to investors. The forward sales contracts lock-in a range of interest rates and prices for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments. We do not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities. All of the mortgage banking segment’s loan portfolio is held for sale and subject to forward sale commitments.  See Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements included herein for further discussion of these items.\nThe following table represents the contractual balances of our on-balance sheet financial instruments at the expected maturity dates, as well as the fair values of those on-balance sheet financial instruments at December 31, 2021. The expected maturity categories take into consideration the actual and anticipated amortization of principal and do not take into consideration the reinvestment of cash or the refinancing of existing indebtedness. Because we sell all of the mortgage loans we originate into the secondary markets, we have made the assumption that the portfolio of mortgage loans held for sale will mature in the first year.\n(a)\nRepresents the fair value recorded pursuant to ASC 815,\nDerivatives and Hedging\n.\n25"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United Sates) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 16, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAssessment of the allowance for losses on contract land deposits\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 3 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s allowance for losses on contract land deposits (“lot deposit reserve”) was $30,041,000 recorded against total contract land deposit assets of $527,180,000 as of December 31, 2021. The Company estimated the lot deposit reserve using a loss contingency analysis that assesses a combination of quantitative and qualitative information for each individual deposit associated with a community. As the Company does not own the lots on which they have placed a deposit, the loss contingency analysis assesses contracts on a community-by-community basis, and records an estimated lot deposit reserve for communities which may result in forfeiture of the lot deposit. In estimating this reserve, the Company evaluates whether it can sell houses at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace, and considers market and economic conditions.\n34\nWe identified the assessment of the lot deposit reserve as a critical audit matter.  Such assessment involved measurement uncertainty that required subjective auditor judgment. Specifically, the assessment encompassed the evaluation of the loss contingency analysis, inclusive of (1) the method used to estimate the reserve assigned to a lot deposit, (2) the quantitative data metrics, as applicable, of profit margin and sales volumes, and (3) the qualitative factors, as applicable, of developer performance and community specific factors. In addition, it was challenging to obtain objective audit evidence, and evaluate the sufficiency of that audit evidence.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over (1) the development and approval of the loss contingency analysis, (2) the determination of the quantitative data metrics and qualitative factors used in the analysis, and (3) the preparation and measurement of the lot deposit reserve estimate. We evaluated the process to develop the quantitative and qualitative information used to assess the lot deposit reserve rates. Specifically, we assessed the consistency of data used in the process with its source, evaluated the reliability of data sources, and considered if all relevant data points were used in the analysis. We tested the reserve balance by:\n•\nassessing the recoverability of a sample of individual lot deposits and comparing our results to those of the Company\n•\nanalyzing the timing of changes for a sample of lot deposits for consistency with changes in quantitative or qualitative data\n•\nevaluating the consistency of the loss contingency analysis by comparing the reserve treatment of similar lot deposits and community positions between the current and prior years\n•\ncomparing prior reserve estimates to subsequent lot deposit forfeiture activity.\nWe also evaluated the collective results of the procedures performed to assess the sufficiency of the audit evidence obtained related to the Company’s lot deposit reserve.\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1987.\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 16, 2022\n35\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors\nNVR, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited NVR, Inc. and subsidiaries\n’\n(the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the years in the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 16, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nKPMG LLP\nMcLean, Virginia\nFebruary 16, 2022\n36\nNVR, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n37\nNVR, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets (Continued)\n(in thousands, except share and per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n38\nNVR, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(in thousands, except per share data)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n39\nNVR, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n40\nNVR, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(in thousands)\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n41\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of NVR, Inc. and its subsidiaries (“NVR”, the “Company”, \"we\", \"us\", or \"our\") and certain other entities in which the Company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary (see Notes 3 and 4 herein for additional information). All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of Estimates in the Preparation of Financial Statements\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Management continually evaluates the estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements and updates those estimates as necessary. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, on information from third party professionals, and other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates made by management.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include short-term investments with maturities at acquisition of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nHomebuilding restricted cash was attributable to customer deposits for certain home sales.  Mortgage banking restricted cash includes amounts collected from customers for loans in process and closed mortgage loans held for sale.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, $\n268\nand $\n269\n, respectively, of cash related to a consolidated variable interest entity is included in homebuilding “Other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\nHomebuilding Inventory\nThe carrying value of inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value. Cost of lots and completed and uncompleted housing units represent the accumulated actual cost of the units. Field construction supervisors’ salaries and related direct overhead expenses are included in inventory costs. Interest costs are not capitalized into inventory, with the exception of land under development and joint venture investments, as applicable (see below). Upon settlement, the cost of the unit is expensed on a specific identification basis. Cost of building materials is determined on a first-in, first-out basis.\nSold inventory is evaluated for impairment based on the contractual sales price compared to the total estimated cost to construct. Unsold inventory is evaluated for impairment by analyzing recent comparable sales prices within the applicable community compared to the costs incurred to date plus the expected costs to complete. Any calculated impairments are recorded immediately in cost of sales.\nContract Land Deposits\nWe purchase finished lots under fixed price lot purchase agreements (“LPAs”) that require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the contract. The deposits are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts and represent a percentage of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe maintain an allowance for losses on contract land deposits that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the existing contract land deposit portfolio at the end of the reporting period. To analyze contract land deposit impairments, we conduct a loss contingency analysis each quarter. In addition to considering market and economic conditions, we assess contract land deposit impairments on a community-by-community basis pursuant to the purchase contract terms, analyzing quantitative and qualitative information including, as applicable, current sales absorption levels, recent sales’ profit margin, the dollar differential between the contractual purchase price and the current market price for lots, a developer’s performance, a developer’s financial ability or willingness to reduce lot prices to current market prices, if necessary, and the contract’s default status by either us or the developer along with an analysis of the expected outcome of any such default.\nOur analysis is focused on whether we can sell houses at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace in a particular community in the current market with which we are faced. Because we do not own the finished lots on which we have placed a contract land deposit, if the above analysis leads to a determination that we cannot sell homes at an acceptable profit margin and sales pace at the current contractual lot price, we then determine whether we will elect to default under the contract, forfeit the deposit and terminate the contract, or whether we will attempt to restructure the LPA, which may require us to forfeit the deposit to obtain contract\n42\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nconcessions from a developer. We also assess whether impairment is present due to collectibility issues resulting from a developer’s non-performance because of financial or other conditions.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 we incurred a net pre-tax recovery of approximately $\n22,100\nof contract land deposits previously determined to be unrecoverable.  For the year ended December 31, 2020, we incurred a net pre-tax charge of approximately $\n25,600\nrelated to the impairment of contract land deposits.  For the year ended December 31, 2019, we incurred a net pre-tax recovery of approximately $\n700\nof contract land deposits previously determined to be unrecoverable.  The contract land deposit assets on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are shown net of the allowance for losses of $\n30,041\nand $\n52,205\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nLand Under Development\nOn a limited basis, we directly acquire raw parcels of land already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots. Land under development includes the land acquisition costs, direct improvement costs, capitalized interest, where applicable, and real estate taxes.\nLand under development, including the land under development held by our unconsolidated joint ventures and the related joint venture investments, is reviewed for potential write-downs when impairment indicators are present. In addition to considering market and economic conditions, we assess land under development impairments on a community-by-community basis, analyzing, as applicable, current sales absorption levels, recent sales’ profit margin, and the dollar differential between the projected fully-developed cost of the lots and the current market price for lots. If indicators of impairment are present for a community, we perform an analysis to determine if the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts, and if so, impairment charges are required to be recorded in an amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of such assets. Our determination of fair value is primarily based on discounting the estimated future cash flows at a rate commensurate with the inherent risks associated with the assets and related estimated cash flow streams.  See Notes 4 and 5 for further discussion of joint venture investments and land under development, respectively.\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is based on the estimated useful lives of the assets using the straight-line method. Model home furniture and fixtures are generally depreciated over a 2-year period, office facilities and other equipment are depreciated over a period of\n3\nto\n10\nyears and production facilities are depreciated over periods of\n5\nto\n40\nyears.\nLeases\nWe determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at the inception of the arrangement.  Once determined that an arrangement is a lease, we then determine if the lease is an operating lease or a finance lease. Both operating and finance leases result in us recording a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease liability on our balance sheet.  The ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term, discounted using our incremental borrowing rate at the commencement date of the lease.  We estimate our incremental borrowing rate based on available published borrowing rates commensurate with our debt rating and the leases term, adjusted to infer collateralization. Specific lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when we believe it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nWe recognize operating lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have elected to use the portfolio approach for certain equipment leases which have similar lease terms and payment schedules. Additionally, for certain equipment we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Our sublease income is de minimis. We have certain leases, primarily the leases of model homes, which have initial lease terms of twelve months or less (\"Short-term leases\").  As is allowed under GAAP, we have elected to exclude Short-term leases from the recognition requirements and they are not included in our recognized ROU assets and lease liabilities. Operating leases are reported in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" and \"Operating lease liabilities\" and finance leases are recorded in homebuilding \"Property, plant and equipment, net\" and\n\"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\"\non the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  See Note 13 herein for further information.\nWarranty/Product Liability Reserves\nWe establish warranty and product liability reserves (\"Warranty Reserve\") to provide for estimated future expenses as a result of construction and product defects, product recalls and litigation incidental to our homebuilding business. Liability estimates are determined based on management’s judgment considering such factors as historical experience, the likely current cost of corrective action, manufacturers’ and subcontractors’ participation in sharing the cost of corrective action, consultations with third party experts such as engineers, and discussions with our general counsel and outside counsel retained to handle specific product liability cases.\n43\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nMortgage Repurchase Reserve, Mortgage Loans Held for Sale and Derivatives and Hedging Activities\nWe originate several different loan products to our customers to finance the purchase of a home through our wholly-owned mortgage subsidiary, NVR Mortgage Finance, Inc. (“NVRM”). NVRM sells all of the loans it originates into the secondary market on a servicing released basis, typically within\n30\ndays from closing. All of the loans that NVRM originates are underwritten to the standards and specifications of the ultimate investor. Those underwriting standards are typically equal to or more stringent than the underwriting standards required by Fannie Mae (“FNMA”), Ginnie Mae (“GNMA”), Freddie Mac (\"FHLMC\"), the Department of Veterans Affairs (“VA”) and the Federal Housing Administration (“FHA”). Insofar as NVRM underwrites its originated loans to those standards, NVRM bears no increased concentration of credit risk from the issuance of loans, except in certain limited instances where repurchases or early payment default occur. NVRM employs a quality control department to ensure that its underwriting controls are effectively operating, and further assesses the underwriting function as part of its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting. NVRM maintains a reserve for losses on mortgage loans originated that reflects our judgment of the present loss exposure in the loans that NVRM has originated and sold. The reserve is calculated based on an analysis of historical experience and exposure (see Note 16 herein for further information).\nMortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value when closed, and thereafter are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, net of deferred origination costs, until sold.\nIn the normal course of business, NVRM enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single-family homes with fixed expiration dates. The commitments become effective when the borrowers “lock-in” a specified interest rate within time frames established by NVRM. All borrowers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment. Market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lock-in” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to an investor. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, NVRM enters into optional or mandatory delivery forward sale contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage-backed securities to investors. The forward sale contracts lock-in a range of interest rates and prices for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments. NVRM does not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities. Both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to investors are undesignated derivatives, and, accordingly, are marked to fair value through earnings. At December 31, 2021, there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating $\n1,028,451\n, and open forward delivery sale contracts aggregating $\n1,184,999\n, which hedge both the rate lock loan commitments and closed loans held for sale (see Note 15 herein for a description of the Company’s fair value accounting).\nEarnings per Share\nThe following weighted average shares and share equivalents were used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nThe assumed proceeds used in the treasury method for calculating our diluted earnings per share includes the amount the employee must pay upon exercise and the amount of compensation cost attributed to future services not yet recognized.\nThe following stock options issued under equity incentive plans were outstanding during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, but were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\n44\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nRevenues – Homebuilding Operations\nWe build single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings, which generally are constructed on a pre-sold basis. Revenue is recognized on the settlement date at the contract sales price, when control is transferred to our customers. Our contract liabilities, consisting of deposits received from customers on homes not settled, were $\n417,463\nand $\n240,758\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Substantially all customer deposits are recognized in revenue within twelve months of being received from customers.  Our contract assets, consisting of prepaid sales compensation, totaled approximately $\n25,200\nand $\n22,500\n, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  These amounts are included in homebuilding “Other assets” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nMortgage Banking Fees\nMortgage banking fees include income earned by NVRM for originating mortgage loans, servicing mortgage loans held on an interim basis, title fees, gains and losses on the sale of mortgage loans and mortgage servicing and other activities incidental to mortgage banking. Mortgage banking fees are generally recognized after the loan has been sold to an unaffiliated, third party investor.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on the deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nASC 740-10,\nIncome Taxes\n, provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more-likely-than-not (defined as a likelihood of more than 50%) that the position will be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, despite our belief that its filing position is supportable, the benefit of that tax position is not recognized in the statements of income. We recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. Based on our historical experience in dealing with various taxing authorities, we have found that it is the administrative practice of the taxing authorities to not seek penalties from us for the tax positions we have taken on our returns related to our unrecognized tax benefits. Therefore, we do not accrue penalties for the positions in which we have an unrecognized tax benefit. We recognize unrecognized tax benefits in the period that the uncertainty is eliminated by either affirmative agreement of the uncertain tax position by the applicable taxing authority, by expiration of the applicable statute of limitation, or by determination in accordance with certain states’ administrative practices that the uncertain tax position has been effectively settled (see Note 11 herein for further information).\nFinancial Instruments\nExcept as otherwise noted herein, we believe that the carrying value approximates the fair value of our financial instruments (see Note 15 herein for further information).\nEquity-Based Compensation\nWe recognize equity-based compensation expense within our income statement for all share-based payment arrangements, which includes non-qualified stock options to purchase shares of NVR common stock (\"Options\") and restricted share units (\"RSUs\"). Compensation expense is based on grant-date fair value of the Options and RSUs granted, and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award (from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant). Options and RSUs which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “service-only” Options and RSUs, and compensation expense is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved. We calculate the fair value of our Options, which are non-publicly traded, using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The grant date fair value of the RSUs is the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant. The reversal of compensation expense previously recognized for grants forfeited is recorded in the period in which the forfeiture occurs. Our equity-based compensation plans are accounted for as equity-classified awards (see Note 12 herein for further discussion of equity-based compensation plans).\nComprehensive Income\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, comprehensive income equaled net income; therefore, a separate statement of comprehensive income is not included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\n45\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n2.    Segment Information, Nature of Operations, and Certain Concentrations\nOur homebuilding operations primarily construct and sell single-family detached homes, townhomes and condominium buildings under\nthree\ntrade names: Ryan Homes, NVHomes and Heartland Homes. The Ryan Homes product is marketed primarily to first-time and first-time move-up buyers. Ryan Homes operates in\nthirty-four\nmetropolitan areas located in Maryland, Virginia, Washington, D.C., West Virginia, Pennsylvania, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, New Jersey, Delaware, Indiana, Illinois and Tennessee.  The NVHomes and Heartland Homes products are marketed primarily to move-up and luxury buyers. NVHomes operates in Delaware and the Washington, D.C., Baltimore, MD and Philadelphia, PA metropolitan areas. Heartland Homes operates in the Pittsburgh, PA metropolitan area. We derived approximately\n22\n% of our 2021 homebuilding revenues from the Washington, D.C. metropolitan area.\nOur mortgage banking segment is a regional mortgage banking operation. Substantially all of our loan closing activity is for our homebuilding customers. Our mortgage banking business generates revenues primarily from origination fees, gains on sales of loans, and title fees. A substantial portion of our mortgage operations is conducted in the Washington, D.C. and Baltimore, MD metropolitan areas.\nThe following disclosure includes\nfour\nhomebuilding reportable segments that aggregate geographically our homebuilding operating segments, and the mortgage banking operations presented as a single reportable segment. The homebuilding reportable segments are comprised of operating divisions in the following geographic areas:\nHomebuilding profit before tax includes all revenues and income generated from the sale of homes, less the cost of homes sold, selling, general and administrative expenses, and a corporate capital allocation charge. The corporate capital allocation charge is eliminated in consolidation and is based on the segment’s average net assets employed. The corporate capital allocation charged to the operating segment allows the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) to determine whether the operating segment’s results are providing the desired rate of return after covering our cost of capital.\nAssets not allocated to the operating segments are not included in either the operating segment's corporate capital allocation charge or the CODM's evaluation of the operating segment's performance. We record charges on contract land deposits when it is determined that it is probable that recovery of the deposit is impaired. For segment reporting purposes, impairments on contract land deposits are charged to the operating segment upon the termination of an LPA with the developer, or the restructuring of an LPA resulting in the forfeiture of the deposit.\nMortgage banking profit before tax consists of revenues generated from mortgage financing, title insurance and closing services, less the costs of such services and general and administrative costs. Mortgage banking operations are not charged a corporate capital allocation charge.\nIn addition to the corporate capital allocation and contract land deposit impairments discussed above, the other reconciling items between segment profit and consolidated profit before tax include unallocated corporate overhead (including all management incentive compensation), equity-based compensation expense, consolidation adjustments and external corporate interest expense. Our overhead functions, such as accounting, treasury and human resources are centrally performed and the costs are not allocated to our operating segments. Consolidation adjustments consist of such items necessary to convert the reportable segments’ results, which are predominately maintained on a cash basis, to a full accrual basis for external financial statement presentation purposes, and are not allocated to our operating segments. External corporate interest expense primarily consists of interest charges on our\n3.95\n% Senior Notes due 2022 and\n3.00\n% Senior Notes due 2030 (the “Senior Notes”), which are not charged to the operating segments because the charges are included in the corporate capital allocation discussed above.\n46\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe following tables present certain segment financial data, with reconciliations to the amounts reported for the consolidated company, where applicable:\n(1)\nThis item represents changes to the contract land deposit impairment reserve, which are not allocated to the reportable segments.  See further discussion of contract land deposit impairment charges in Note 3.\n(2)\nThe decrease in equity-based compensation expense in 2020 was primarily attributable to stock options issued in 2014 under the 2014 Equity Incentive Plan becoming fully vested in 2019. In addition, there were higher stock option forfeitures in 2020 compared to 2019.\n(3)\nThis item represents the elimination of the corporate capital allocation charge included in the respective homebuilding reportable segments. The corporate capital allocation charge is based on the segment’s monthly average asset balance, and was as follows for the years presented:\n47\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n(4)    The decrease in consolidation adjustments and other for 2021 compared to 2020 is driven by changes in lumber prices in 2021.  Our reportable segments' results include the intercompany profits of our production facilities for home packages delivered to our homebuilding divisions. For homes not yet settled, these intercompany profits are reversed through the consolidation adjustments. Due to the significantly higher lumber prices in the first half of 2021, the previously reversed intercompany profits were recognized in subsequent quarters through the consolidation adjustment as homes were settled, and our consolidated homebuilding margins were negatively impacted by the higher lumber costs.\n48\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n3.\nVariable Interest Entities\nLot  Purchase Agreements\nWe generally do not engage in land development. Instead, we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers under LPAs. The LPAs require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the LPAs. The deposits required under the LPAs are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts, and typically range up to\n10\n% of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots.\nWe believe this lot acquisition strategy reduces the financial risks associated with direct land ownership and land development. We may, at our option, choose for any reason and at any time not to perform under these LPAs by delivering notice of our intent not to acquire the finished lots under contract. Our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these LPAs is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provisions contained within the LPAs. None of the creditors of any of\n49\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nthe development entities with which we enter LPAs have recourse to our general credit. We generally do not have any specific performance obligations to purchase a certain number or any of the lots, nor do we guarantee completion of the development by the developer or guarantee any of the developers’ financial or other liabilities.\nWe are not involved in the design or creation of the development entities from which we purchase lots under LPAs. The developer’s equity holders have the power to direct 100% of the operating activities of the development entity. We have no voting rights in any of the development entities. The sole purpose of the development entity’s activities is to generate positive cash flow returns for the equity holders. Further, we do not share in any of the profit or loss generated by the project’s development. The profits and losses are passed directly to the developer’s equity holders.\nThe deposit placed by us pursuant to the LPA is deemed to be a variable interest in the respective development entities. Those development entities are deemed to be variable interest entities (“VIE”). Therefore, the development entities with which we enter into LPAs, including the joint venture limited liability corporations, discussed below, are evaluated for possible consolidation by us. An enterprise must consolidate a VIE when that enterprise has a controlling financial interest in the VIE. An enterprise is deemed to have a controlling financial interest if it has i) the power to direct the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance, and ii) the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could be significant to the VIE or the rights to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE.\nWe believe the activities that most significantly impact a development entity’s economic performance are the operating activities of the entity. Unless and until a development entity completes finished building lots through the development process to be able to sell, the process of which the development entity’s equity investors bear the full risk, the entity does not earn any revenues. The operating development activities are managed solely by the development entity’s equity investors.\nThe development entities with which we contract to buy finished lots typically select the respective projects, obtain the necessary zoning approvals, obtain the financing required with no support or guarantees from us, select who will purchase the finished lots and at what price, and manage the completion of the infrastructure improvements, all for the purpose of generating a cash flow return to the development entity’s equity holders and all independent of us. We possess no more than limited protective legal rights through the LPA in the specific finished lots that we are purchasing, and we possess no participative rights in the development entities. Accordingly, we do not have the power to direct the activities of a developer that most significantly impact the developer’s economic performance. For this reason, we concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of the development entities with which we enter into LPAs, and therefore we do not consolidate any of these VIEs.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we controlled approximately\n122,800\nlots under LPAs with third parties through deposits in cash and letters of credit totaling approximately $\n521,900\nand $\n10,100\n, respectively. As noted above, our sole legal obligation and economic loss for failure to perform under these LPAs is limited to the amount of the deposit pursuant to the liquidated damage provisions contained in the LPAs and, in very limited circumstances, specific performance obligations. During 2021, we recorded a net reversal of approximately $\n22,100\nrelated to previously impaired lot deposits as market conditions have improved.  Our contract land deposit asset is shown net of a $\n30,041\nand $\n52,205\nimpairment reserve at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nIn addition, we have certain properties under contract with land owners that are expected to yield approximately\n15,500\nlots, which are not included in the number of total lots controlled.  Some of these properties may require rezoning or other approvals to achieve the expected yield.  These properties are controlled with deposits in cash totaling approximately $\n5,300\nas of December 31, 2021, of which approximately $\n3,400\nis refundable if we do not perform under the contract. We generally expect to assign the raw land contracts to a land developer and simultaneously enter into an LPA with the assignee if the project is determined to be feasible.\nOur total risk of loss related to contract land deposits as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\n50\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n4.\nJoint Ventures\nOn a limited basis, we obtain finished lots using joint venture limited liability corporations (“JVs”). The JVs are typically structured such that we are a non-controlling member and at risk only for the amount we have invested, or committed to invest, in addition to any deposits placed under LPAs with the joint venture. We are not a borrower, guarantor or obligor on any debt of the JVs, as applicable. We enter into a standard LPA to purchase lots from these JVs, and as a result have a variable interest in these JVs.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately $\n20,300\nin\nfour\nJVs that are expected to produce approximately\n2,300\nfinished lots, of which approximately\n1,900\nlots were controlled by us and the remaining approximately\n400\nlots were either under contract with unrelated parties or not currently under contract. We had additional funding commitments totaling approximately $\n2,500\nin one of the JVs at December 31, 2021.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we recognized an impairment of approximately $\n1,300\nrelated to one of the JVs. The charge was recorded to homebuilding \"Cost of sales\" on the accompanying consolidated statements of income. None of the other JVs had any indicators of impairment during 2021.\nWe determined that we are not the primary beneficiary in three of the JVs because we and the other JV partner either share power or the other JV partner has the controlling financial interest. The aggregate investment in unconsolidated JVs was approximately $\n20,300\nand $\n23,600\nat December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and is reported in the “Other assets” line item on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. For the remaining JV, we concluded that we are the primary beneficiary because we have the controlling financial interest in the JV.  All activities under the consolidated JV had been completed and as of December 31, 2021, we had no remaining investment in the JV.  The JV had remaining balances of $\n268\nin cash and $\n248\nin accrued expenses, which are included in homebuilding \"Other assets\" and \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities,\" respectively, in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nAt December 31, 2020, we had an aggregate investment totaling approximately $\n23,600\nin\nfour\nJVs that were expected to produce approximately\n5,200\nfinished lots, of which approximately\n2,200\nlots were controlled by us and the remaining approximately\n3,000\nlots were either under contract with unrelated parties or not currently under contract. In addition, at December 31, 2020, we had additional funding commitments in the aggregate totaling $\n3,100\nto\none\nof the JVs. During the fourth quarter of 2020, one of the JVs sold a portion of its owned land. As a result of the sale, we received a distribution from the JV of approximately $\n13,100\nand recognized a net gain on the sale of approximately $\n5,000\n.\n5.\nLand Under Development\nOn a limited basis, we directly acquire raw land parcels already zoned for its intended use to develop into finished lots.  Land under development includes the land acquisition costs, direct improvement costs, capitalized interest, where applicable, and real estate taxes.\nDuring 2021, we had the following significant land under development transactions:\n–\nSold a land parcel to a developer for approximately $\n45,800\n, which approximated our carrying value of the property as of the sale date.  In conjunction with the sale, we entered into an LPA with the developer for the option to purchase the finished lots expected to be developed from the parcel.\n–\nCompleted the development of\none\nland parcel and transferred development costs totaling approximately $\n16,500\nto inventory.\n–\nPurchased\ntwo\nraw land parcels for a total purchase price of approximately $\n11,200\n, which are expected to produce approximately\n200\nlots.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned land with a carrying value of $\n12,147\nthat we intend to develop into approximately\n200\nfinished lots primarily for use in our homebuilding operations. We also have additional funding commitments of approximately $\n2,700\nunder a joint development agreement related to one project, a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately $\n800\n. None of our land under development projects had any indicators of impairment as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we directly owned land with a carrying value of $\n62,790\n, which was expected to produce approximately\n500\nfinished lots.\n51\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n6.\nCapitalized Interest\nWe capitalize interest costs to land under development during the active development of finished lots. In addition, we capitalize interest costs to our joint venture investments while the investments are considered qualified assets pursuant to ASC 835-20,\nInterest\n. Capitalized interest is transferred to inventory as the development of finished lots is completed, then charged to cost of sales upon our settlement of homes and the respective lots. Interest incurred in excess of the interest capitalizable based on the level of qualified assets is expensed in the period incurred.\nOur interest costs incurred, capitalized, expensed and charged to cost of sales during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n7.\nRelated Party Transactions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we entered into LPAs to purchase finished building lots for a total purchase price of approximately $\n189,000\nwith Elm Street Development, Inc. (“Elm Street”), which is controlled by\none\nof our directors, William Moran. The independent members of our Board of Directors approved these transactions. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, we purchased developed lots at market prices from Elm Street for approximately $\n43,700\n, $\n60,200\nand $\n44,600\n, respectively.\nWe also continue to control a parcel of raw land expected to yield approximately\n1,600\nfinished lots through a JV entered into with Elm Street during 2009. We did not make any investments in the JV in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n8.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment (“PP&E”)\n9.\nDebt\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following debt instruments outstanding:\n3.95% Senior Notes due 2022 (\"2022 Senior Notes\")\nOn September 10, 2012, we issued $\n600,000\nof the 2022 Senior Notes. The 2022 Senior Notes were issued at a discount to yield\n3.97\n% and have been reflected net of the unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs in the accompanying\n52\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nconsolidated balance sheets. The offering of the 2022 Senior Notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $\n593,900\n, after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering expenses. The 2022 Senior Notes mature on\nSeptember 15, 2022\nand bear interest at\n3.95\n%, payable\nsemi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15\n. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the unamortized discount was $\n87\nand $\n207\n, respectively, and unamortized debt issuance costs were $\n359\nand $\n868\n, respectively.\n3.00% Senior Notes due 2030 (\"2030 Senior Notes\")\nOn May 4, 2020, we issued $\n600,000\nof the 2030 Senior Notes. The 2030 Senior Notes were issued at a discount to yield\n3.02\n% and have been reflected net of the unamortized discount and unamortized debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The offering of the 2030 Senior Notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $\n595,200\n, after deducting underwriting discount and offering expenses. The 2030 Senior Notes mature on\nMay 15, 2030\nand bear interest at\n3.00\n%, payable\nsemi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15\n. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the unamortized discount was $\n975\nand $\n1,075\n, respectively, and unamortized debt issuance costs were $\n3,025\nand $\n3,387\n, respectively.\nOn September 9 and September 17, 2020, we issued an additional $\n250,000\nand $\n50,000\n, respectively, of the 2030 Senior Notes (the \"2030 Additional Notes\" and together with the 2030 Senior Notes and the 2022 Senior Notes, the \"Senior Notes\"). The 2030 Additional Notes were issued at a premium to yield\n2.00\n% and have been reflected net of the unamortized premium and unamortized debt issuance costs in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet. The offering of the 2030 Additional Notes resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately $\n323,600\n, including the underwriting premium, less offering expenses. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the 2030 Additional Notes unamortized premium was $\n21,945\nand $\n24,324\n, respectively, and unamortized debt issuance costs were $\n1,243\nand $\n1,392\n, respectively.\nThe Senior Notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with any of our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness, will rank senior in right of payment to any of our future indebtedness that is by its terms expressly subordinated to the Senior Notes and will be effectively subordinated to any of our existing and future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the collateral securing such indebtedness. The indenture governing the Senior Notes has, among other items, and subject to certain exceptions, covenants that restrict our ability to create, incur, assume or guarantee secured debt, enter into sale and leaseback transactions and conditions related to mergers and/or the sale of assets. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Senior Notes at December 31, 2021.\nCredit Agreement\nOn February 12, 2021, we entered into The Amended and Restated Credit Agreement with Bank of America, N.A., as Administrative Agent, BOFA Securities, Inc. as Sole Lead Arranger and Sole Bookrunner, and other lenders party thereto (the \"Credit Agreement\").  The Credit Agreement provides for aggregate revolving loan commitments of $\n300,000\n(the \"Facility\").  Under the Credit Agreement, we may request increases of up to $\n300,000\nto the Facility in the form of revolving loan commitments or term loans to the extent that new or existing lenders agree to provide additional revolving loan or term loan commitments.  In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $\n100,000\nsublimit for the issuance of letters of credit of which approximately $\n16,100\nwas outstanding at December 31, 2021.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement generally bear interest for Base Rate Loans at a Base Rate equal to the highest of (i) a Federal Funds Rate plus one-half of one percent, (ii) Bank of America’s publicly announced “prime rate,” and (iii) the Eurodollar Rate plus one percent, plus the Applicable Rate which is based on our debt rating, or for Eurodollar Rate Loans, at the Eurodollar Rate equal to LIBOR plus the Applicable Rate.\nThe Credit Agreement contains various representations and affirmative and negative covenants that are generally customary for credit facilities of this type. Such covenants include, among others, the following financial maintenance covenants: (i) minimum consolidated tangible net worth; (ii) minimum interest coverage ratio or minimum liquidity and (iii) a maximum leverage ratio. The negative covenants include, among others, certain limitations on liens, investments and fundamental changes. The Credit Agreement termination date is\nFebruary 12, 2026\n. We were in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement at December 31, 2021.  There was\nno\ndebt outstanding under the Facility at December 31, 2021.\nRepurchase Agreement\nIn July 2021, NVRM entered into the Thirteenth Amendment (the “Amendment”) to its Amended and Restated Master Repurchase Agreement dated August 2, 2011 with U.S. Bank National Association (as amended by the Amendment and twelve earlier amendments, the “Repurchase Agreement”). The purpose of the Repurchase Agreement is to finance the origination of mortgage loans by NVRM. The Repurchase Agreement provides for loan purchases up to $\n150,000\n, subject to certain sub limits.\nAdvances under the Repurchase Agreement carry a Pricing Rate based on the LIBOR Rate plus the LIBOR Margin, as determined under the Repurchase Agreement, provided that the Pricing Rate shall not be less than\n1.75\n%. The Pricing Rate at December 31, 2021 was\n1.88\n%. There are several restrictions on purchased loans, including that they cannot be sold to others, they cannot be pledged to anyone other than the agent, and they cannot support any other borrowing or repurchase agreement. Amounts\n53\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\noutstanding under the Repurchase Agreement are collateralized by our mortgage loans held for sale. At December 31, 2021, there were no borrowing base limitations reducing the amount available under the Repurchase Agreement. As of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was\nno\ndebt outstanding under the Repurchase Agreement. The Repurchase Agreement expires on\nJuly 20, 2022\n.\nThe Repurchase Agreement contains various affirmative and negative covenants. The negative covenants include, among others, certain limitations on transactions involving acquisitions, mergers, the incurrence of debt, sale of assets and creation of liens upon any of its Mortgage Notes. Additional covenants include (i) a tangible net worth requirement, (ii) a minimum liquidity requirement, (iii) a minimum net income requirement, and (iv) a maximum leverage ratio requirement. NVRM was in compliance with all covenants under the Repurchase Agreement at December 31, 2021.\n10.\nCommon Stock\nThere were\n3,447,441\nand\n3,695,577\ncommon shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe made the following share repurchases during the years indicated:\nWe issue shares from the treasury account for all equity plan activity. We issued\n74,027\n,\n159,151\nand\n275,906\nsuch shares during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n11.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nDeferred income taxes on our consolidated balance sheets were comprised of the following:\nDeferred tax assets arise principally as a result of various accruals required for financial reporting purposes and equity-based compensation expense, which are not currently deductible for tax return purposes.\n54\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nManagement believes that we will have sufficient future taxable income to make it more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized. Federal taxable income is estimated to be approximately $\n1,334,100\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, and was $\n770,000\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020.\nA reconciliation of income taxes computed at the federal statutory rate (\n21\n% in 2021, 2020, and 2019) to income tax expense is as follows:\n(1)\nExcludes state excess tax benefits from equity-based compensation included in the line below.\n(2)\nPrimarily attributable to tax benefits from certain energy credits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nOur effective tax rate in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was\n22.24\n%,\n16.40\n% and\n14.36\n%, respectively.\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return, as well as state and local tax returns in all jurisdictions where we maintain operations. With few exceptions, we are no longer subject to income tax examinations by tax authorities for years prior to 2018.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nIf recognized, the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the effective tax rate (net of the federal tax benefit) is $\n26,456\nas of December 31, 2021.\nWe recognize interest related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recognized a net reversal of accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits in the amount of $\n1,455\n, $\n420\nand $\n1,467\n, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had a total of $\n13,849\nand $\n15,304\n, respectively, of accrued interest on unrecognized tax benefits which are included in “Accrued expenses and other liabilities” on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nWe believe that within the next 12 months, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 will be reduced by approximately $\n6,464\ndue to statute expiration and effectively settled positions in various state jurisdictions.\n55\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\n12.\nEquity-Based Compensation, Profit Sharing and Deferred Compensation Plans\nEquity-Based Compensation Plans\nOur equity-based compensation plans provide for the granting of Options and RSUs to key management employees, including executive officers and members of our Board of Directors (\"Directors\"). The exercise price of Options granted is equal to the closing price of our common stock on the New York Stock Exchange (the “NYSE”) on the day prior to the date of grant. Options are granted for a\n10\n-year term and typically vest in separate tranches over periods of\n3\nto\n6\nyears. RSUs generally vest in separate tranches over periods of\n2\nto\n6\nyears.  Grants are generally divided such that vesting for\n50\n% of the grant is contingent solely on continued employment or service as a Director, while vesting for the remaining\n50\n% of the grant is contingent upon both continued employment or service as a Director and the achievement of a performance metric based on our return on capital performance relative to a peer group during a 3-year period specified on the date of grant.\nThe following table provides a summary of each of our equity-based compensation plans with grants outstanding at December 31, 2021.  Each of the following plans was approved by our shareholders:\n(1)\nThe 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”) authorizes us to issue Options and RSUs. There were\n63,869\nOptions and\n13,034\nRSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Shares can no longer be granted from this plan.\n(2)\nThe 2014 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2014 Plan”) authorizes us to issue Options only.\n(3)\nThe 2018 Equity Incentive Plan (the \"2018 Plan\") authorizes us to issue Options and RSUs. Of the\n275,000\naggregate shares authorized to issue, all may be granted in the form of Options and up to\n40,000\nmay be granted in the form of RSUs.  There were\n115,950\nOptions and\n3,530\nRSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2021.  Of the\n155,270\nshares available to issue,\n36,470\nmay be granted in the form of RSUs.\nDuring 2021, we issued\n18,912\nOptions under the 2014 Plan.  These options vest over\nfour years\nin\n25\n% increments beginning on either December 31, 2023 or December 31, 2024, based on the date of grant. Vesting for half of the Options issued is contingent solely upon continued employment, while vesting for the other half of the Options issued is contingent upon both continued employment and our return on capital performance during the three year periods beginning 2021 or 2022.\nIn addition,\n50\nRSUs were granted under the 2018 Plan during 2021. These RSUs vest over\ntwo years\nin\n50\n% increments beginning on December 31, 2023. Vesting for the RSUs is contingent solely upon continued employment.\n56\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe following table provides additional information relative to our equity-based compensation plans for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nTo estimate the grant-date fair value of our Options, we use the Black-Scholes option-pricing model (the “Pricing Model”). The Pricing Model estimates the per share fair value of an option on its date of grant based on the following factors: the option’s exercise price; the price of the underlying stock on the date of grant; the estimated dividend yield; a risk-free interest rate; the estimated option term; and the expected volatility. For the risk-free interest rate, we use U.S. Treasury STRIPS which mature at approximately the same time as the option’s expected holding term. For expected volatility, we have concluded that our historical volatility over the option’s expected holding term provides the most reasonable basis for this estimate.\nThe fair value of the Options granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was estimated on the grant date using the Pricing Model, based on the following assumptions:\nThe weighted average grant date fair value per share of $\n4,973.30\nfor the RSUs was the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately preceding the date of grant.\nCompensation cost for Options and RSUs is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award (from the date of grant through the period of the last separately vesting portion of the grant). For the recognition of equity-based compensation, the Options and RSUs which are subject to a performance condition are treated as a separate award from the “service-only” Options and RSUs, and compensation cost is recognized when it becomes probable that the stated performance target will be achieved. We currently believe that it is probable that the stated performance condition will be satisfied at the target level for all of our Options and RSUs granted. Compensation cost is recognized within the income statement in the same expense line as the cash compensation paid to the respective employees.\n57\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nWe recognize forfeitures of equity-based awards as a reduction to compensation costs in the period in which they occur. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $\n58,234\n, $\n50,794\n, and $\n78,532\nin equity-based compensation costs, respectively, and approximately $\n12,000\n, $\n10,500\n, and $\n16,800\nin tax benefit related to equity-based compensation costs, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total unrecognized compensation cost for all outstanding Options and RSUs equaled approximately $\n129,700\n. The unrecognized compensation cost will be recognized over each grant’s applicable vesting period with the latest vesting date being December 31, 2027. The weighted-average period over which the unrecognized compensation cost will be recorded is equal to approximately\n2.1\nyears.\nWe settle Option exercises and vesting of RSUs by issuing shares of treasury stock. Shares are relieved from the treasury account based on the weighted average cost of treasury shares acquired. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we issued\n74,027\n,\n159,151\nand\n275,906\nshares, respectively, from the treasury account for Option exercises and vesting of RSUs.\nInformation with respect to the vested RSUs and exercised Options is as follows:\nProfit Sharing Plans\nWe have a trustee-administered, profit sharing retirement plan (the “Profit Sharing Plan”) and an Employee Stock Ownership Plan (“ESOP”) covering substantially all employees. The Profit Sharing Plan and the ESOP provide for annual discretionary contributions in amounts as determined by our Directors. The combined plan contribution for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was approximately $\n24,700\n, $\n22,500\nand $\n20,300\n, respectively. We purchased approximately\n4,500\nand\n5,000\nshares of our common stock in the open market for the 2021 and 2020 plan year contributions to the ESOP. As of December 31, 2021, all shares held by the ESOP had been allocated to participants’ accounts. The 2021 plan year contribution was funded and fully allocated to participants in February 2022.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nWe have\ntwo\ndeferred compensation plans (“Deferred Comp Plans”). The specific purpose of the Deferred Comp Plans is to i) establish a vehicle whereby named executive officers may defer the receipt of salary and bonus that otherwise would be nondeductible for Company tax purposes into a period where we would realize a tax deduction for the amounts paid, and ii) to enable certain employees who are subject to our stock holding requirements to acquire shares of our common stock on a pre-tax basis in order to more quickly meet, and maintain compliance with those stock holding requirements. Amounts deferred into the Deferred Comp Plans are invested in our common stock, held in a rabbi trust account, and are paid out in a fixed number of shares upon expiration of the deferral period.\nThe rabbi trust account held\n106,697\nshares of NVR common stock as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Shares held by the Deferred Comp Plans are treated as outstanding shares in our earnings per share calculation for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n13.\nLeases\nWe have operating leases for our corporate and division offices, production facilities, model homes, and certain office and production equipment.  Additionally, we have entered into finance leases for one of our production facilities and certain plant equipment.  Our leases have remaining lease terms of up to\n18.7\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to\n20\nyears, and some of which include options to terminate the lease.  See Note 1 herein for additional information regarding leases.\n58\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nOther information related to leases was as follows:\n59\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nWe are committed under multiple non-cancelable operating and finance leases involving office space, model homes, production facilities, automobiles and equipment. Future lease payments under these operating and finance leases as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n14.\nCommitments and Contingent Liabilities\nLitigation\nWe are involved in various litigation arising in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, and based on advice of legal counsel, this litigation is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Legal costs incurred in connection with outstanding litigation are expensed as incurred.\nContract Land Deposits\nWe generally do not engage in land development. Instead, we typically acquire finished building lots from various third party land developers under LPAs. The LPAs require deposits that may be forfeited if we fail to perform under the agreement. The deposits required under the LPAs are in the form of cash or letters of credit in varying amounts, and typically range up to\n10\n% of the aggregate purchase price of the finished lots. At December 31, 2021, assuming that contractual development milestones are met and we exercise our option,we expect to place additional forfeitable deposits with land developers under existing LPAs of approximately $\n299,800\n.  Additionally, as of December 31, 2021, we had funding commitments totaling approximately $\n2,700\nunder a joint development agreement related to our land under development, a portion of which we expect will be offset by development credits of approximately $\n800\n.\nBonds and Letters of Credit\nDuring the ordinary course of operating the homebuilding and mortgage banking businesses, we are required to enter into bond or letter of credit arrangements with local municipalities, government agencies, or land developers to collateralize our obligations under various contracts. We had approximately $\n36,600\nof contingent obligations under such agreements, including approximately $\n16,100\nfor letters of credit issued under the Credit Agreement as of December 31, 2021. We believe we will fulfill our obligations under the related contracts and do not anticipate any material losses under these bonds or letters of credit.\n60\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nWarranty Reserve\nThe following table reflects the changes in our warranty reserve (see Note 1 herein for further discussion of warranty/product liability reserves):\n15.\nFair Value\nGAAP assigns a fair value hierarchy to the inputs used to measure fair value. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted market prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe following table presents the estimated fair values and carrying values of our Senior Notes as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. The estimated fair value is based on recent market prices of similar transactions, which is classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nExcept as otherwise noted below, we believe that insignificant differences exist between the carrying value and the fair value of our financial instruments, which consists primarily of cash equivalents, due to their short term nature.\nDerivative Instruments and Mortgage Loans Held for Sale\nIn the normal course of business, NVRM enters into contractual commitments to extend credit to buyers of single-family homes with fixed expiration dates. The commitments become effective when the borrowers “lock-in” a specified interest rate within time frames established by NVRM. All borrowers are evaluated for credit worthiness prior to the extension of the commitment. Market risk arises if interest rates move adversely between the time of the “lock-in” of rates by the borrower and the sale date of the loan to an investor. To mitigate the effect of the interest rate risk inherent in providing rate lock commitments to borrowers, NVRM enters into optional or mandatory delivery forward sales contracts to sell whole loans and mortgage-backed securities to investors. The forward sales contracts lock-in a range of interest rates and prices for the sale of loans similar to the specific rate lock commitments. NVRM does not engage in speculative or trading derivative activities. Both the rate lock commitments to borrowers and the forward sale contracts to investors are undesignated derivatives and, accordingly, are marked to fair value through earnings. At December 31, 2021, there were contractual commitments to extend credit to borrowers aggregating $\n1,028,451\nand open forward delivery contracts aggregating $\n1,184,999\n, which hedge both the rate lock loan commitments and closed loans held for sale.\n61\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nThe fair value of our rate lock commitments to borrowers and the related input levels includes, as applicable:\ni)\nthe assumed gain/loss of the expected resultant loan sale (Level 2);\nii)\nthe effects of interest rate movements between the date of the rate lock and the balance sheet date (Level 2); and\niii)\nthe value of the servicing rights associated with the loan (Level 2).\nThe assumed gain/loss considers the excess servicing to be received or buydown fees to be paid upon securitization of the loan. The excess servicing and buydown fees are calculated pursuant to contractual terms with investors. To calculate the effects of interest rate movements, NVRM utilizes applicable published mortgage-backed security prices, and multiplies the price movement between the rate lock date and the balance sheet date by the notional loan commitment amount. NVRM sells all of its loans on a servicing released basis, and receives a servicing released premium upon sale. Thus, the value of the servicing rights is included in the fair value measurement and is based upon contractual terms with investors and varies depending on the loan type. NVRM assumes a fallout rate when measuring the fair value of rate lock commitments. Fallout is defined as locked loan commitments for which NVRM does not close a mortgage loan and is based on historical experience.\nThe fair value of NVRM’s forward sales contracts to investors solely considers the market price movement of the same type of security between the trade date and the balance sheet date (Level 2). The market price changes are multiplied by the notional amount of the forward sales contracts to measure the fair value.\nMortgage loans held for sale are recorded at fair value when closed, and thereafter are carried at the lower of cost or fair value, net of deferred origination costs, until sold. Fair value is measured using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of loans held for sale of $\n302,192\nincluded on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet were increased by $\n4,296\nfrom the aggregate principal balance of $\n297,896\n.  As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of loans held for sale of $\n449,760\nwere increased by $\n10,042\nfrom the aggregate principal balance of $\n439,718\n.\nThe fair value measurement of NVRM's undesignated derivative instruments was as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the net rate lock commitments are reported in mortgage banking \"Other assets\" and the net forward sales contracts are reported in mortgage banking \"Accrued expenses and other liabilities\" on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nThe fair value measurement as of December 31, 2021 was as follows:\nThe total fair value measurement as of December 31, 2020 was $\n15,583\n. NVRM recorded a fair value adjustment to income of $\n2,654\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, a fair value adjustment to expense of $\n1,472\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020,\n62\nNVR, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nand a fair value adjustment to income of $\n198\nfor the year ended December 31, 2019.  Unrealized gains/losses from the change in the fair value measurements are included in earnings as a component of mortgage banking fees in the accompanying consolidated statements of income. The fair value measurement will be impacted in the future by the change in the value of the servicing rights, interest rate movements, security price fluctuations, and the volume and product mix of NVRM’s closed loans and locked loan commitments.\n16.\nMortgage Repurchase Reserve\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized pre-tax charges for loan losses related to mortgage loans sold of approximately $\n2,600\n, $\n3,200\nand $\n4,200\n, respectively. Included in the Mortgage Banking segment’s “Accounts payable and other liabilities” line item on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets is a mortgage repurchase reserve equal to approximately $\n21,400\nand $\n20,500\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n63"
