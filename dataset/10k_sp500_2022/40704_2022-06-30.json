Internationally,\nwe\ncompete with both multi-national and local manufacturers, and each\ncountry includes a unique group of competitors.\n5\nRaw materials, ingredients, and packaging\nThe\nprincipal\nraw\nmaterials that\nwe\nuse\nare grains\n(wheat, oats,\nand\ncorn),\ndairy\nproducts,\nsugar,\nfruits, vegetable\noils, meats,\nnuts,\nvegetables,\nand\nother\nagricultural\nproducts.\nWe\nalso\nuse\nsubstantial\nquantities\nof\ncarton\nboard,\ncorrugated,\nplastic,\nand\nmetal\npackaging\nmaterials,\noperating\nsupplies,\nand\nenergy.\nMost\nof\nthese\ninputs\nfor\nour\ndomestic\nand\nCanadian\noperations\nare\npurchased\nfrom suppliers\nin the\nUnited States. In\nour other\ninternational operations,\ninputs that\nare not locally\navailable in\nadequate supply\nmay\nbe imported\nfrom other\ncountries.

We\nbelieve\nthat we\nwill be\nable to\nobtain an\nadequate supply\nof needed\ninputs. Occasionally\nand where\npossible, we\nmake advance\npurchases of\nitems\nsignificant\nto our\nbusiness in\norder\nto ensure\ncontinuity\nof operations.\nOur objective\nis to\nprocure\nmaterials\nmeeting\nboth our\nquality standards\nand our\nproduction\nneeds at\nprice levels\nthat allow\na targeted\nprofit margin.\nSince these\ninputs generally\nrepresent\nthe largest\nvariable cost in\nmanufacturing our products,\nto the extent\npossible, we often\nmanage the risk\nassociated with adverse\nprice\nmovements for some inputs using a variety of risk\nmanagement strategies. We also\nhave a grain merchandising operation that provides\nus efficient access\nto, and more informed\nknowledge of, various\ncommodity markets, principally\nwheat and oats.
