    "text": "Overview\nWe are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (“Isle” or “Isle of Capri”) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018. On July 20, 2020, we completed the merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (“Former Caesars”) pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”) and we changed the Company’s ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market from “ERI” to “CZR”. On April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC (the “William Hill Acquisition”).\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by casino properties’ gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming, and we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties.\nWe lease certain real property assets from third parties, including GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”) and VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“VICI”).\nAs of December 31, 2021, we own, lease or manage an aggregate of 52 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 55,700 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,900 table games and approximately 47,700 hotel rooms. We also operate and conduct sports wagering across 21 states and domestic jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in five states. We continue to expand into additional markets as jurisdictions legalize forms of retail and online sports betting. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. See Item 2, “Properties,” for more information about our properties.\nSignificant Transactions in 2021\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which the Company would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for\n£2.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion\n.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the “Bridge Facility Borrower”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day £1.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day £116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Debt Financing”). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The £1.5 billion Interim Facilities Agreement (the “Interim Facilities Agreement”) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, we repaid the £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full £116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of £700 million. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill’s non-U.S. operations including the UK and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, “William Hill International”), all of which are held for\n3\nsale as of the date of the closing of the William Hill Acquisition and reflected within discontinued operations. Certain investments acquired have been excluded from the held for sale asset group.\nOn September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately £2.2 billion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, the Company expects to receive approximately £835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. In order to\nmanage the risk of changes in the GBP denominated sales price and expected proceeds, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts.\nThe sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nOn April 6, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of the equity interests of MontBleu Casino Resort & Spa (“MontBleu”) to Bally’s Corporation for $15 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment, resulting in a gain of less than $1 million. The purchase price for MontBleu is due no later than the first anniversary of the consummation of the transaction. MontBleu was within the Regional segment.\nOn June 3, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of the real property and equity interests of Tropicana Evansville (“Evansville”) to GLPI and Bally’s Corporation (formerly “Twin River” or Twin River Worldwide Holdings, Inc.), respectively, for $480 million, resulting in a gain of $12 million. Evansville was within the Regional segment.\nOn September 3, 2021, the Company consummated the sale of Caesars Southern Indiana to the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (“EBCI”) for $250 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment, resulting in a gain of $12 million. In connection with the transaction, the Company’s annual base rent payments to VICI Properties under the Regional Master Lease (as defined below) were reduced by $33 million. Additionally, the Company and EBCI extended their existing relationship by entering into a 10-year brand license agreement, with cancellation rights in exchange for a termination fee at the buyer’s discretion following the fifth anniversary of the agreement, for the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana. Caesars Southern Indiana was previously reported within the Regional segment and subsequent to the sale, as a result of the license agreement relating to the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana, is reported within the Managed and Branded segment.\nOn November 1, 2021, the Company and VICI consummated the sale of Harrah’s Louisiana Downs Casino, Racing & Entertainment (“Harrah’s Louisiana Downs”) to Rubico Acquisition Corp. for $22 million, subject to a customary working capital adjustment. The proceeds from the sale were split between the Company and VICI. The annual base rent payments under the Regional Lease between Caesars and VICI remain unchanged.\nOn August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC (“Horseshoe Baltimore”), a property which it also manages, to approximately 75.8%. Caesars was subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and we began to consolidate the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. Our previously held investment was remeasured as of the date of our change in ownership and the Company recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. Management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within our Managed and Branded segment. Following the increase in ownership, the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore are presented within the Regional segment.\nOn December 1, 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the operations of Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel (“Baton Rouge”) to CQ Holding Company, Inc. The transaction has received regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to other customary closing conditions.\nDevelopments related to COVID-19\nIn January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified and spread throughout much of the world, including the U.S. All of the Company’s casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.\nFollowing temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the Company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. As properties began to reopen during the year ended December 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal COVID-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.\n4\nThe Company experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. Although we have experienced a decline in net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. However, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. Future effects of COVID-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of Caesars Windsor from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022. Extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.\nBusiness Operations\nOur consolidated business is composed of five complementary businesses that reinforce, cross-promote, and build upon each other: casino, which includes our online sports betting and iGaming, food and beverage, hotel, casino management services, retail and entertainment and other business operations.\nCasino Operations\nOur casino operations generate revenues from approximately 55,700 slot machines and 2,900 table games, including poker, as well as other games such as keno, and race and online sportsbooks, all of which comprised approximately 61% of our total net revenues in 2021. Slot revenues generate the majority of our casino revenues.\nOnline Sports Betting and iGaming\nWe previously entered into a 25-year agreement with William Hill PLC’s U.S. subsidiary, William Hill U.S. Holdco, Inc. (“William Hill US” and together with William Hill PLC, “William Hill”), which became effective January 29, 2019, and granted to William Hill the right to conduct betting activities, including operating sportsbooks, in retail channels and under certain skins for online channels with respect to our current and future properties and conduct certain real money online gaming activities. On April 22, 2021, we consummated our previously announced acquisition of William Hill PLC in an all-cash transaction. Prior to the transaction, we accounted for our investment in William Hill PLC as an investment in equity securities we accounted for our investment in William Hill US as an equity method investment.\nPrior to the acquisition, William Hill operated 37 sportsbooks at our properties in eight states. Subsequent to the William Hill Acquisition, we operate and conduct sports wagering across 21 U.S. states and domestic jurisdictions as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we operate regulated online real money gaming businesses in five states and continue to leverage the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) brand, and license the WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and services. Players in markets such as New Jersey can play hundreds of casino games including slots, table games, and video poker and we expect to similarly increase product offerings in Pennsylvania, Michigan and additional states as iGaming is legalized.\nExtensive usage of digital platforms, continued legalization in additional states, and growing bettor demand are driving the market for online sports betting platforms in the United States and the William Hill Acquisition positioned us to address this growing market.\nOn August 2, 2021, we launched our Caesars Sportsbook app on our owned and integrated technology platform we have labeled Liberty (“Liberty”). We have launched a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and media personalities promoting the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app. The app offers extensive pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Caesars Sportsbook has partnerships with the NFL, NBA, NHL, MLB, and several individual teams, while being the exclusive odds provider for ESPN and CBS Sports. We continue to create new partnerships among collegiate and professional sports teams including the exclusive naming-rights partnership that rebranded the Caesars Superdome. Growth in the Caesars Digital segment continues to be realized with the expansion into new states as jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting.\nSports Brand Partnerships —\nOur strategy includes developing local and national partnerships that align our sportsbooks, casinos, resorts and brands with sports fans. In 2019, we announced high-profile exclusive sports entertainment partnerships with the NFL, making Caesars the first-ever “Official Casino Sponsor” in the history of the league. This historic partnership combines the NFL’s legendary events with our properties to bring unique experiences to Caesars patrons. This includes exclusive rights to use NFL trademarks to promote our properties, also enabling Caesars to host exclusive special events and experiences. Caesars will continue to host brand activations at prominent, high-profile NFL events, including the NFL Draft, NFL playoffs, and the Super Bowl during this multi-year partnership.\n5\nFood and Beverage Operations\nOur food and beverage operations generate revenues from our dining venues, bars, nightclubs, and lounges located throughout our casinos and represented approximately 12% of our total net revenues in 2021. Many of our properties include several dining options, ranging from upscale dining experiences to moderately-priced restaurants, some of which offer pickup or in-room delivery options.\nHotel Operations\nHotel operations generate revenues from hotel stays at our properties in our approximately 47,700 guest rooms and suites worldwide and represented approximately 16% of our total net revenues in 2021. Our properties operate at various price and service points, allowing us to host a variety of casino guests, who are visiting our properties for gaming and other casino entertainment options, and non-casino guests who are visiting our properties for other purposes, such as vacation travel or conventions.\nManagement and Branding Arrangements\nWe earn revenue from fees paid for the management of four domestic casinos. Managed properties represent Caesars-branded properties where we provide staffing and management services under management agreements. In addition, we authorize the use of certain brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. We earn revenue from brand license fees received based on the arrangements.\nEntertainment and Other Non-Gaming Operations\nWe provide a variety of retail and entertainment offerings at our properties. We operate various entertainment venues across the United States, including the Colosseum at Caesars Palace and Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood. These award-winning entertainment venues host or have announced plans to host, prominent headliners, such as Adele, John Legend, Sting, Donny Osmond and Keith Urban.\nThe LINQ Promenade is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail development located between The LINQ Hotel & Casino and Flamingo Las Vegas, which features The High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel, and Fly LINQ, the first and only zipline on the Las Vegas Strip. The retail stores offer guests a wide range of options from high-end brands and accessories to souvenirs and decorative items.\nCAESARS FORUM is a 550,000 square-foot conference center located at the center of the Las Vegas Strip. CAESARS FORUM features 300,000 square feet of flexible meeting space, the two largest pillarless ballrooms in the world, LEED silver-rating, and FORUM Plaza, the first 100,000 square-foot outdoor meeting and event space in Las Vegas. Though currently available for use with no restrictions, COVID-19 related restrictions limited our ability to utilize the convention center and meeting space at full capacity during the first half of 2021.\nMarket Activities\nTrends\nCOVID-19 and Related Impacts —\nThe extent of the ongoing and future effects of COVID-19 on our business and the casino resort industry and economy generally remains uncertain. While we experienced positive operating trends in 2021, we continued to see a prolonged impact of COVID-19 on the economy, our industry and our Company, with increased challenges arising from labor shortages, supply chain challenges, increasing costs of goods and services, inflation and rising interest rates, among other impacts. The continuing impact of COVID-19 and such related challenges on our business will depend on future developments, including but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak or new variants, restrictions on operations imposed by governmental authorities, the potential for authorities reimposing stay at home orders, international and domestic travel restrictions or additional restrictions in response to continued developments with COVID-19, the Company’s ability to adapt to evolving operating procedures and maintain adequate staffing in response to increased consumer demand and discretionary spending, the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines in response to any potential new variants, and the Company’s ability to adjust its cost structures for the duration of the outbreak’s effect on our operations. We also expect that our business and the casino resort industry and economy generally will continue to be impacted by shortages of labor, supply chain challenges, increasing costs of goods and services, inflation and rising interest rates and that such impacts may intensify.\nOnline Betting and Gaming —\nOnline betting and gaming is a rapidly developing sector of the e-commerce industry and we believe the digital segment of the global betting and gaming industry will continue to grow in popularity and consumer confidence. The market for online betting platforms is being driven by increased use of digital processes and global, growing bettor demand. We anticipate that the United States market will begin to have a strong and steady uptake in active wagers as\n6\nstate-by-state legislation in the United States continues to evolve in response to recent legislation resulting in new opportunities in the United States sports betting market. The extent and future effects of online betting and gaming on our casino properties is uncertain but we expect that our online betting and gaming offering will be complementary to our brick-and-mortar casino business.\nCompetition\nThe casino entertainment business is highly competitive. The industry is comprised of a diverse group of competitors that vary considerably in size and geographic diversity, quality of facilities and amenities available, marketing and growth strategies, and financial condition. In most regions, we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding areas. In Las Vegas, our largest jurisdiction, competition is expected to increase in the coming years. In response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. There have also been proposals for other large scale non-gaming development projects in Las Vegas by various other developers. Our Las Vegas Strip hotels and casinos also compete, in part, with each other.\nIn recent years, many casino operators, including us, have been reinvesting in existing facilities, developing or rebranding new casinos or complementary facilities, and acquiring established facilities. These reinvestment and expansion efforts combined with aggressive marketing strategies by us and many of our competitors have resulted in increased competition in many regions. As companies have completed new expansion projects, supply has grown at a faster pace than demand in some areas. The expansion of properties and entertainment venues into new jurisdictions also presents competitive issues.\nOur properties also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on Native American tribal lands. While the competitive impact on operations in Las Vegas from the continued growth of Native American gaming establishments in California remains uncertain, the proliferation of gaming in California and other areas located in the same regions as our properties could have an adverse effect on our results of operations. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes. In addition, certain states have legalized, and others may legalize, casino gaming in specific areas, including metropolitan areas from which we traditionally attract customers. These factors create additional challenges for us in competing for customers and accessing cash flow or financing to fund improvements for our casino and entertainment products that enable us to remain competitive.\nWe also compete with other non-gaming resorts and vacation areas, various other entertainment businesses, and other forms of gaming, such as state lotteries, on-track and off-track wagering, video lottery terminals, and card parlors. Our non-gaming offerings also compete with other retail facilities, amusement attractions, food and beverage offerings, and entertainment venues. Internet gaming and sports betting also create additional competition for our brick-and-mortar operations.\nWe face significant competition in our online sports betting and iGaming businesses in jurisdictions where we currently operate. Although we have experienced recent success in obtaining approval for sports betting and iGaming licenses in new jurisdictions, new state launches require significant upfront investment. Our investment into new markets is executed through promotional incentives, marketing and advertising spend to establish ourselves as an industry leader.\nResources Material to Business\nRewards Programs\nWe believe Caesars Rewards, with a network of more than 60 million people, enables us to compete more effectively and capture a larger share of our customers’ entertainment spending when they travel among regions versus that of a standalone property and engage in online wagering and gaming, which is core to our cross-market strategy.\nMembers who have joined Caesars Rewards can earn Reward Credits for qualifying gaming activity, including sports betting, online gaming and wagering, and qualifying hotel, dining and retail spending at all Caesars-affiliated properties in the United States, Canada and Dubai. Members can also earn additional Reward Credits when they use their Caesars Rewards VISA credit card or make a purchase through a Caesars Rewards partner. Members can redeem their earned Reward Credits with Caesars for hotel amenities, retail and online casino free play and other items such as merchandise, gift cards, and travel.\nCaesars Rewards is structured in tiers (designated as Gold, Platinum, Diamond or Seven Stars), each with increasing member benefits and privileges. Members are provided promotional offers based on their Tier Level, their engagement with Caesars-affiliated properties, aspects of their retail and online casino gaming play, and their preferred spending choices outside of gaming. Member information is also used in connection with various marketing promotions, including campaigns involving direct mail, email, our websites, mobile devices, social media, and interactive slot machines.\n7\nIntellectual Property and Resources\nWe use a variety of trade names, service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights in our operations and believe that we have all the licenses necessary to conduct our continuing operations. The development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy. We regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We have registered several service marks, trademarks, patents and copyrights with the United States Patent and Trademark Office or otherwise acquired the licenses to use those which are material to conduct our business. We also own patents relating to unique casino games. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one patent, trademark, copyright, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations and technology through the use of patents, trademarks, copyrights, and trade secret laws. We file applications for and obtain patents, trademarks, and copyrights in the United States and foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate, including United States and foreign patent applications covering certain proprietary technology of Caesars Enterprise Services, LLC (“CES”). We also seek to maintain our trade secrets and confidential information by nondisclosure policies and through the use of appropriate confidentiality agreements. CES’ United States patents have varying expiration dates.\nWe have not applied for the registration of all of our trademarks, copyrights, proprietary technology, or other intellectual property rights, as the case may be, and may not be successful in obtaining all intellectual property rights for which we have applied. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe upon our intellectual property and use information that we regard as proprietary, and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great of an extent as do the laws of the United States. In addition, others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property.\nWe own or have the right to use proprietary rights to a number of trademarks that we consider, along with the associated name recognition, to be valuable to our business, including Eldorado, Silver Legacy, Isle, Lady Luck, Tropicana, Circus Circus, Caesars, Flamingo, Harrah’s, Horseshoe, Paris, Caesars Rewards, Caesars Sportsbook, William Hill, WSOP, and a license for the Planet Hollywood trademark used in connection with the Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas.\nOur Caesars Sportsbook and iGaming app is powered by our Liberty platform. We currently operate the Liberty platform in 14 mobile sports betting states. The Liberty platform resulted in a significant upgrade to our user interface and significant product upgrades including numerous pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Our Liberty platform also integrates customers with the Caesars Rewards loyalty program.\nIndustry Overview\nSee Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.” See also Exhibit 99.1, “Gaming Overview,” to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nSeasonality\nWe believe that business at our regional properties outside of Las Vegas is subject to seasonality, including seasonality based on the weather in the markets in which they operate and the travel habits of visitors. Business in our properties can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, such as Easter (particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year), the timing of the WSOP tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. We also believe that any seasonality, holiday, or other significant event may affect our various properties or regions differently. We may also experience seasonality with retail and online sports betting which coincides with certain sporting events, as well as seasons of professional and collegiate basketball and football.\nGaming Licenses and Governmental Regulations\nThe gaming and racing industries are highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. We are subject to extensive regulation under laws, rules and supervisory procedures. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and characters of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interests in the gaming operations. If additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate, such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us. From time to time, various proposals have been introduced in legislatures of jurisdictions in which we have operations that, if enacted, could adversely affect the tax, regulatory, operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and us. We do not know whether or when such legislation will be enacted. Gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. Any material increase in these taxes or fees could adversely affect us.\n8\nSome jurisdictions, including those in which we are licensed, empower their regulators to investigate participation by licensees in gaming outside their jurisdiction and require access to periodic reports respecting those gaming activities. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.\nUnder provisions of gaming laws in jurisdictions in which we have operations, and under our organizational documents, certain of our securities are subject to restriction on ownership which may be imposed by specified governmental authorities. The restrictions may require a holder of our securities to dispose of the securities or, if the holder refuses, or is unable to dispose of the securities, we may be required to repurchase the securities.\nA more detailed description of the regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which is incorporated herein by reference.\nInternal Revenue Service Regulations\nThe Internal Revenue Service requires operators of casinos and online sports betting apps located in the United States to file information returns for U.S. citizens, including names and addresses of winners for keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings in excess of stipulated amounts. The Internal Revenue Service also requires operators to withhold taxes on some keno, bingo, slot machine and retail and online sports betting winnings of nonresident aliens. We are unable to predict the extent to which these requirements, if extended, might impede or otherwise adversely affect operations of, and/or income from, other games.\nRegulations adopted by the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network of the Treasury Department (“FINCEN”) requires the reporting of currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day, including identification of the patron by name and social security number. This reporting obligation began in May 1985 and may have resulted in the loss of gaming revenues to jurisdictions outside the United States which are exempt from the ambit of these regulations. In addition to currency transaction reporting requirements, suspicious financial activity is also required to be reported to FINCEN.\nOther Laws and Regulations\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state and local laws and regulations in addition to gaming regulations. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, food service, smoking, environmental matters, employees and employment practices, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.\nThe sale of alcoholic beverages is subject to licensing, control and regulation by applicable local regulatory agencies. All licenses are revocable and are not transferable. The agencies involved have full power to limit, condition, suspend or revoke any license, and any disciplinary action could, and revocation would, have a material adverse effect upon our operations.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional discussion.\nTaxation\nGaming companies are typically subject to significant taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. From time to time, federal, state, local and provincial legislators and officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. It is not possible to determine with certainty the likelihood of changes in tax laws or in the administration of such laws.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to various federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws and regulations, including but not limited to air quality, indoor air quality, water quality, bulk storage of regulated materials, and disposal of waste, including hazardous waste. Such laws and regulations can impose liability on potentially responsible parties (owner/operators of real property) to clean up, or contribute to the cost of cleaning up, sites at which regulated materials were disposed of or released. In addition to investigation and remediation liabilities that could arise under such laws and regulations, we could face personal injury, property damage, fines or other claims by third parties concerning environmental compliance, contamination or exposure to hazardous conditions. Environmental regulatory violations also include monetary penalties assessed by the\n9\njurisdictional regulatory agency and civil or criminal penalties for intentional negligence. Occasionally and under certain circumstances, we have investigated and remediated (or contributed to remediation costs) contamination located at or near our facilities. Examples included contamination related to underground storage tanks and groundwater contamination arising from prior uses of land on which certain facilities are located. In addition, we have and continue to contain, manage, and dispose of manure and wastewater generated by concentrated animal feeding operations due to our racetrack operations; manage, abate, or remove indoor air quality concerns such as mold, lead, or asbestos-containing materials; and manage operations within applicable environmental permitting requirements. Although we have incurred and expect to incur costs related to various environmental matters such as investigations, remediation, and management of hazardous materials or conditions known or discovered to exist at our properties, those costs have not had, and are not expected to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flow.\nClimate Change\nThere has been an increasing focus of international, national, state, regional and local regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas (“GHG”), including carbon dioxide and methane, emissions, and climate change issues. The United States is a member of the Paris Agreement, a climate accord reached at the Conference of the Parties (“COP 21”) in Paris, that set many new goals, and many related policies are still emerging. The Paris Agreement requires set GHG emission reduction goals every five years beginning in 2020. Stronger GHG emission targets were set at COP 26 in Glasgow in November 2021.\nFuture regulation could impose stringent standards to substantially reduce GHG emissions. Legislation to regulate GHG emissions has periodically been introduced in the U.S. Congress. The current Administration has taken steps to further regulate GHG emissions. Those reductions could be costly and difficult to implement or estimate.\nBeyond financial and regulatory effects, the projected severe effects of climate change – such as property damage or supply chain issues stemming from extreme weather events – has already and may continue to directly affect our facilities and operations. Caesars recognizes the impacts of climate change and is engaged in long-term initiatives to identify, assess, and manage the risks and opportunities associated with climate change (see “Environmental Stewardship” below).\nReporting and Record-Keeping Requirements\nWe are required periodically to submit detailed financial and operating reports and furnish any other information about us and our subsidiaries that gaming authorities may require. We are required to maintain a current stock ledger that may be examined by gaming authorities at any time. If any securities are held in trust by an agent or by a nominee, the record holder may be required to disclose the identity of the beneficial owner to gaming authorities. A failure to make such disclosure may be grounds for finding the record holder unsuitable. Gaming authorities may, and in certain jurisdictions do, require certificates for our securities to bear a legend indicating that the securities are subject to specified gaming laws.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe aim to provide a workplace that is engaging, empowering, inclusive and respectful for all employees (our “Team Members”), embracing a culture of openness, passion for service and recognition. Our ongoing investment in professional training and development, safety, health and wellbeing and Team Member recognition linked to guest satisfaction are all important drivers of our success in delivering strong financial results and creating value for our communities. We have approximately 49,000 employees at our domestic properties throughout our organization.\nLabor Relations\nApproximately 23,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements with certain of our subsidiaries. The majority of these employees in various job positions are covered by the following agreements:\n10\nTeam Member Engagement, Compensation, Benefits, Development, Safety and Wellbeing\nWe strive to inspire our Team Members through our mission, vision and values, and our Code of Commitment (described below). To evaluate our Team Member experience and our retention efforts, we monitor a number of employee measures, such as turnover rates and Team Member satisfaction. In 2021, we implemented new Team Member experience surveys to help us further understand the drivers of engagement and areas where we can improve. These surveys will be completed on a regular basis alongside additional surveys targeted at specific events within a Team Member cycle, including new hires, anniversary milestones and exit inquiries.\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract, retain and motivate our Team Members. In addition to competitive salaries and wages, we provide a variety of short-term, long-term and incentive-based compensation programs to reward performance relative to key metrics relevant to our business. We offer comprehensive benefit options including, but not limited to, retirement savings plans, health insurance coverage (including medical, mental health, dental, vision and pharmacy), parental leave, educational assistance, training opportunities and company-paid life insurance.\nWe place utmost importance on creating a safe workplace for our Team Members, embedding procedures so that all our Team Members have the awareness, knowledge and tools to make safe working a habit.\nWe also have maintained a wellness program to help our Team Members improve their health and wellbeing. This program has demonstrated improved health metrics for participating employees and their covered family members helping reduce the cost of healthcare for Team Members and for the Company. Effective in 2022, we consolidated our group health plans and made significant enhancements to our offerings and wellness program including a wide range of affordable options, mental health initiatives and expanded onsite and virtual clinics across the US.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe embrace diversity and aim to create an inclusive working environment that celebrates all our Team Members as individuals. Our diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”) framework identifies five pillars of activity: advocacy, Team Members, suppliers, communities and guests for a holistic approach to embedding DEI in everything we do. We publish our DEI data in our annual Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) report (described below). Currently, 45% of leadership roles in the Company are held by women and 43% are held by people of color, excluding the recent acquisition of William Hill. In addition, we set our new goals around gender and racial diversity with a target of 50% of leadership roles to be held by women and 50% of leadership roles to be held by people of color by 2025. We also commit to increase the representation of people of color in senior leadership by 50%. Furthermore, in 2021 we became the first gaming company named as a “Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion” in the 2021 Disability Equality Index.\nCorporate Social Responsibility\nCaesars’ Board of Directors (the “Board”) and senior executives view CSR as an integral element in the way we do business, in the belief that being a good corporate citizen helps protect the company against risk, contributes to improved performance and helps foster positive relationships with all those with whom we connect. The Board and our executive management are committed to being an industry leader in CSR (which includes diversity, equity and inclusion, social impact, and environmental sustainability). In 2021, the Board and our leadership continued to engage with our CEO-level external CSR Advisory Board comprised of experts representing DEI, business strategy, academia and investors, and used their guidance to confirm our CSR priorities. These priorities are reflected in our 12th annual CSR report, published in 2021 in accordance with Global Reporting Initiative Standards.\nCSR Committee of the Board\nFollowing the Merger in July 2020, Caesars’ Board formed a CSR committee that defines the duties and responsibilities of the Board in supporting delivery of our corporate purpose and CSR strategy as well as CSR-related aspects of corporate governance such as Board diversity.\n11\nCode of Commitment\nCaesars is committed to being a responsible corporate citizen and environmental steward through our CSR strategy, PEOPLE PLANET PLAY. This is reflected in our Code of Commitment which is our public pledge to our guests, Team Members, communities, business partners and all those we reach that we will honor the trust they have placed in us through ethical conduct and integrity. We commit to:\n•\nPEOPLE: Supporting the wellbeing of our Team Members, guests and local communities.\n•\nPLANET: Taking care of the world we all call home.\n•\nPLAY: Creating memorable experiences for our guests and leading responsible gaming practices in the industry.\nPEOPLE PLANET PLAY Strategy\nOur PEOPLE PLANET PLAY strategy defines how we meet the obligations of our Code of Commitment and is aligned with global priorities articulated by the United Nations as the Sustainable Development Goals. PEOPLE PLANET PLAY establishes multi-year targets in key areas of impact, including science-based greenhouse gas emissions-reduction, formally approved by the Science Based Targets Initiative (“SBTi”), aligning with global best practices on climate change action. We plan to complete a stakeholder analysis and comprehensive double materiality assessment in 2022, reflecting the latest sustainability and social trends, transparency demands and our business strategy that will also align with the investor community’s Environment, Social and Governance requirements. Following our stakeholder analysis and materiality assessment, we plan to revise our strategic goals under the PEOPLE PLANET PLAY framework, with the expectation that we will commit to additional multi-year targets beyond those we continue to advance.\nResponsible Gaming\nFor more than thirty years, Caesars has maintained its Responsible Gaming (“RG”) program. We train tens of thousands of Team Members each year and a cadre of RG Ambassadors throughout our properties to identify guests in need of assistance and provide support. In recent years, Caesars has contributed to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, the National Council on Problem Gaming and other state programs to help advance responsible practices in the gaming industry. Caesars Digital also maintains responsible gaming programs tailored to each state in which it operates and offers users in-application RG tools such as time on device restrictions and wagering limits.\nCaesars maintains a comprehensive risk-based Bank Secrecy Act (“BSA”) and Anti-Money Laundering (“AML”) program. It includes strong governance and effective internal controls and procedures to comply with applicable BSA requirements, regulatory guidance, and any related laws, and to take measures to prevent its affiliated casinos from being used for money laundering or other criminal activity. Execution of the program is governed with reference to FINCEN’s guidance on the Culture of Compliance. Caesars internal AML Policy, Know Your Customer Policy and BSA Identification Policy outline the Caesars AML Program and set the minimum standards for the related procedures and internal controls of the Caesars casino affiliates. Employees are required to complete annual trainings related company policies, including AML.\nCaesars also maintains a Code of Ethics and Business Conduct (the “Code”) that includes standards designed to deter wrongdoing and to promote, amongst other standards, honest and ethical conduct and full, fair, accurate, timely and understandable disclosure in reports and documents that the Company files with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Caesars’ Chief Legal Officer serves as the compliance officer of the Code and Caesars provides periodic training regarding the contents and importance of the Code.\nCaesars also maintains an Amended and restated Gaming Compliance Plan (the “Plan”), which is approved by various gaming regulators. The Plan is designed to oversee procedures to enhance the likelihood that no activities of the Company or any Affiliate will impugn the reputation and integrity of Caesars. The Plan and also establishes a Compliance Committee that assists the Company in implementing its strict policy that its business be conducted with honesty and integrity, and in accordance with high moral, legal and ethical standards. Caesars’ Assistant General Counsel & SVP – Regulatory & Compliance serves as the Compliance Officer as defined by the Plan.\nEnvironmental Stewardship\nWe take a proactive approach to environmental sustainability through our CodeGreen strategy established by Former Caesars in 2007, consistently improving our performance across energy and GHG emissions efficiencies, reduction of water consumption and increasing waste diversion from landfills. Caesars recognizes the impact climate change can play both on our business and the guests we serve. Identifying, assessing, and managing the risks and opportunities therefore plays a vital role in our long-term strategic thinking on climate and water, and how we approach our CSR goals. Former Caesars adopted Science Based Targets (“SBTs”) as part of its strategy to reduce environmental impact. These targets, approved to be in line with well below 2\n12\ndegrees Celsius per SBTi are (i) reducing absolute Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 35% by 2025, and 100% by 2050 from a 2011 base-year and (ii) having 60% of suppliers by spend institute science-based GHG reduction targets for their operations by 2023. In 2022, we expect to establish a new baseline to reaffirm GHG emission reduction goals as a combined company. For 2020, following the Merger, we modeled our GHG emissions data to create an estimate for 2018 and prior years back to 2011. This enabled us to compare our progress against our SBTs using actual data from 2019 and 2020 against a modeled 2011 base year. Between 2011 and 2020, Caesars estimated a reduction in absolute Scopes 1 and 2 GHG emissions of 36.1%. We recognize that 2020 was an atypical year with property closures and business interruptions resulting from COVID-19 that had a material impact on our results. Caesars is pursuing renewable energy sources and low-carbon options, including on site solar developments. Our long-term goals include a continued focus on energy efficiency and conservation as well as evaluating renewable energy supply opportunities for each of our properties in pursuit of our forthcoming SBTs.\nWe voluntarily participate in the CDP (formerly the Carbon Disclosure Project), an international nonprofit that runs a global disclosure system for investors, companies, and regions to manage their environmental impacts. In 2021, Caesars scored an A for water security and a B for climate change for our 2020 performance and earned a spot on the Supplier Engagement Leaderboard from CDP. Just 2% of companies assessed by CDP make the A List and only 8% make the Supplier Engagement Leaderboard.\nWe are engaged in extensive waste reduction efforts across our facilities, including recycling, food donation, and manure composting. In 2020, we diverted 45% of our total waste from landfills.\nCommunity Investment\nCaesars contributes extensively to our local communities to help them develop and prosper, through funding community projects, employee volunteering and cash donations from the Caesars Foundation, a private foundation funded from our operating income. In 2021, the Caesars Foundation contributed $1.8 million to communities across the United States. The Foundation also continued to support significant national relationships that support diversity, equity and inclusion. In addition, we donated $3.1 million generated from parking fees at Las Vegas properties to nine local nonprofit organizations. During 2020, our Team Members volunteered over 91,000 hours through the HERO program.\nMany of our community partners are long-term collaborations. For example, we have many years of partnership with Meals on Wheels America to combat the issues of senior hunger and isolation. We also partner with Clean the World to reduce waste from soap bars and plastics from our hotel operations, and Boys and Girls Club of America to support the mission of enabling young people to reach their full potential as productive, caring, responsible citizens.\nWe host national Economic Equity Tours through live webinars and on-line resources for thousands of women of color owned small businesses, and diverse non-profits. Expert-led webinars provided resources in the areas of financial empowerment, nonprofit organization development, and entrepreneurship. In Spring of 2022, we will host a DEI Summit, in alignment with our nonprofit and corporate partners, to support the advancement of inclusion and advocacy and promotion and support of DEI.\nAvailable Information\nWe are required to file annual, quarterly and other current reports and information with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”). Because we submit filings to the SEC electronically, access to this information is available at the SEC’s website (www.sec.gov). This site contains reports and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC.\nWe make our Annual Reports on Form 10-K, our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, our Current Reports on Form 8-K, and all amendments to these reports, available free of charge on our corporate website (\nwww.caesars.com/corporate\n) as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

    "text": "Risks Relating to Operating Our Business\nThe outbreak of COVID-19 and COVID-19 related impacts have had, and are expected to continue to have, a significant impact on our operations and results of operations.\nCOVID-19 and mitigation measures recommended or required by public health officials to slow the spread of COVID-19 have materially adversely affected our operations. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies and, following re-opening of our properties, our operations have been affected by social distancing measures, including reduced gaming operations, limitations on number of customers present in our facilities, restrictions on hotel, food and beverage outlets and limits on events that would otherwise attract customers to our properties. While restrictions on our operations were eased in 2021 and we experienced positive operating trends during 2021, we continued to see a prolonged impact of COVID-19 on the economy, our industry and our Company, with increased challenges arising from labor shortages, supply chain challenges, increasing costs of goods and services, inflation and rising interest rates, among other impacts. The continuing impact of COVID-19 and such related challenges on our business will ultimately depend on future developments, including but not limited to, the duration and severity of the outbreak or new variants, restrictions on operations imposed by governmental authorities, the potential for authorities reimposing stay at home orders, international and domestic travel restrictions or additional restrictions in response to continued developments with the COVID-19 public health emergency, our ability to adapt to evolving operating procedures and maintain adequate staffing in response to increased customer demand, the impact on consumer demand and discretionary spending, the efficacy and acceptance of vaccines, and our ability to adjust our cost structures for the duration of any such interruption of our operations. The extent and duration of the impact of COVID-19 on our business is difficult to predict, but it could be significant and protracted, and we expect that our business and the casino resort industry and economy generally will continue to be impacted by shortages of labor, supply chain challenges, increasing costs of goods and services, inflation and rising interest rates and that such impacts may intensify.\nWe face substantial competition and expect that such competition will continue.\nThe gaming industry is highly competitive and competition is intense in most of the markets in which we operate. We compete with a variety of gaming operations, including land-based casinos, dockside casinos, riverboat casinos, casinos located on racing tracks and casinos located on Native American reservations and other forms of legalized gaming such as video gaming terminals at bars, restaurants and truck stops and online gambling and sports betting. We also compete, to a lesser extent, with other forms of legalized gaming and entertainment such as bingo, pull tab games, card parlors, sportsbooks, fantasy sports websites, “cruise-to-nowhere” operations, pari-mutuel or telephonic betting on horse racing and dog racing, state-sponsored lotteries, jai-alai and, in the future, may compete with gaming at other venues. In addition, we compete more generally with other forms of entertainment for the discretionary spending of our customers. In some instances, particularly in the case of Native American casinos, our competitors pay lower taxes or no taxes.\nIn recent years, many casino and online gaming operators, including us, have reinvested in existing jurisdictions to attract new customers or to gain market share, thereby increasing competition in those jurisdictions. In particular, we and other online betting and gaming operators have undertaken extensive marketing campaigns and made significant investments in customer acquisition through pricing and promotional policies. In addition, in response to changing trends, Las Vegas operators have been focused on expanding their non-gaming offerings, including upgrades to hotel rooms, new food and beverage offerings, and new entertainment offerings. The expansion of online betting and gaming in new jurisdictions and the growth of the number of competitors in the online betting and gaming market, the expansion of existing casino entertainment properties, the increase in the number of properties, and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we operate, and this intense competition is expected to continue. These competitive pressures have and are expected to continue to adversely affect our financial performance.\nOur brick-and-mortar operations face increasing competition as a result of the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting, including our own online betting and gaming operations, in a number of the jurisdictions in which we operate. While we believe that we are well positioned to compete with new entrants to the betting and gaming market through our online betting and gaming offerings, the competitive dynamic is evolving and we cannot assure you that our results of operations will not be adversely impacted by the expansion of legalized online gaming and betting.\nStates that already have legalized casino gaming may further expand gaming, and other states that have not yet legalized gaming may do so in the future. We also compete with Native American gaming operations in California and other jurisdictions where Native American tribes operate large-scale gaming facilities or otherwise conduct gaming activities on Native American lands, which we expect will continue to expand. Further expansion of legalized casino gaming in jurisdictions in or near our\n16\nmarkets or changes to gaming laws in states in which we have operations and in states near our operations could increase competition and could adversely affect our operations.\nIncreased competition may require us to make substantial expenditures in marketing, customer development and capital projects to maintain and enhance the competitive positions of our online and brick and mortar operations to increase the attractiveness and add to the appeal of our facilities and product offerings. Because a significant portion of our cash flow is required to pay obligations under our outstanding indebtedness and our lease obligations, there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient funds to undertake, or that we will be able to obtain sufficient financing to fund, such expenditures. If we are unable to make such expenditures, our competitive position could be negatively affected.\nOur business is sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy and other factors outside our control.\nConsumer demand for casino hotel and racetrack properties and online betting and gaming is particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the associated impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities. Changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions, effects of declines in consumer confidence in the economy, the impact of high energy and food costs, the increased cost of travel, decreased disposable consumer income and wealth, fears of war and future acts of terrorism, or widespread illnesses or epidemics, including COVID-19, can have a material adverse effect on leisure and business travel, discretionary spending and other areas of economic behavior that directly impact the gaming and entertainment industries in general and could further reduce customer demand for the amenities and products that we offer. In addition, increases in gasoline prices, including increases prompted by global political and economic instabilities, can adversely affect our casino operations because most of our patrons travel to our properties by car or on airlines that may pass on increases in fuel costs to passengers in the form of higher ticket prices.\nWin rates (hold rates) for our casino operations depend on a variety of factors, some of which are beyond our control, and participation in the sports betting industry exposes us to trading, liability management and pricing risks. We may experience lower than expected profitability and potentially significant losses as a result of factors beyond our control or a failure to accurately determine odds.\nThe gaming industry is characterized by an element of chance. Accordingly, we employ theoretical win rates to estimate what a certain type of game, on average, will win or lose in the long run. In addition to the element of chance, win rates (hold percentages) are also affected by the spread of table limits and factors that are beyond our control, such as a player’s skill, experience, and behavior, the mix of games played, the financial resources of players, the volume of bets placed, and the amount of time players spend gambling. As a result of the variability in these factors, the actual win rates at our casinos may differ from the theoretical win rates we have estimated and could result in the winnings of our gaming customers exceeding those anticipated. The variability of win rates (hold rates) also have the potential to negatively impact our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nOur fixed-odds betting products involve betting where winnings are paid on the basis of the amounts wagered and the odds quoted. Odds are determined with the objective of providing an average return to the bookmaker over a large number of events. However, there can be significant variation in gross win percentage event-by-event and day-by-day. We have systems and controls that seek to reduce the risk of daily losses occurring on a gross-win basis, but there can be no assurance that these will be effective in reducing our exposure to this risk. As a result we may experience (and we have from time to time experienced) significant losses with respect to individual events or betting outcomes, in particular if large individual bets are placed on an event or betting outcome or series of events or betting outcomes. Any significant losses on a gross-win basis could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, the odds that we offer in our sportsbook operations may occasionally contain an obvious error. Examples of such errors are inverted lines between teams, or odds that are significantly different from the true odds of the outcome in a way that all reasonable persons would agree is an error. If regulatory restrictions do not permit us to void or re-setting odds to correct odds on bets associated with large obvious errors in odds making, we could be subject to covering significant liabilities.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services that are essential to the operation of our online betting and gaming business, including, player account management, geolocation and identity verification, payment processing and sports data.\nWe rely on third parties to provide services that are essential to the operation of our online betting and gaming business, including player account management, geolocation and identity verification systems to ensure we comply with laws and regulations, processing deposits and withdrawals made by our online users and providing information regarding schedules, results, performance and outcomes of sporting events to determine when and how bets are settled. The software, systems and services provided by our third-party providers may not meet our expectations, contain errors or weaknesses, be compromised or\n17\nexperience outages. A failure of such third-party systems to perform effectively, or any service interruption to those systems, could adversely affect our business by preventing users from accessing our online platform, delaying payment or resulting in errors in settling bets, which could give rise to regulatory issues relating to the operation of our business. By way of example, incorrect or misleading geolocation and identity verification data with respect to current or potential users received from third-party service providers may result in us inadvertently allowing access to our offerings to individuals who are not permitted to access them or otherwise inadvertently denying access to individuals who are permitted to access them, and errors or failures by our payment processors and sports data providers could result in a failure in timely and accurately process payments to and from users or errors in settling bets. Any such errors or failures could result in violations of applicable regulatory requirements and adversely affect our reputation and our ability to attract and retain our online users. Furthermore, negative publicity related to any of our third-party partners could adversely affect our reputation and brand, and could potentially lead to increased regulatory or litigation exposure.\nIn addition, if any of our third-party services providers terminates its relationship with us, is unable to maintain necessary regulatory approvals, or refuses to renew its agreement with us on commercially reasonable terms, we would have to find alternate service providers. We cannot be certain that we would be able to secure favorable terms from alternative service providers that are critical to the operation of our business or enter into alternative arrangements in a timely manner. Our digital business, results of operations and prospects would be adversely impacted by our inability or delay in securing replacement services that are sufficient to support our online business or are on comparable terms.\nThe growth of our digital business will depend, in part, on the success of our strategic relationships with third parties.\nWe rely on relationships with sports leagues and teams, media companies and other third parties in order to attract users to our offerings. In 2019 we entered into an exclusive sports entertainment partnership with the NFL, making us the first ever “Official Casino Sponsor” in the history of the league and in 2020, we partnered with ESPN to integrate their digital platforms with our sportsbooks. These relationships, along with providers of online services, search engines, social media, directories and other websites and e-commerce businesses direct consumers to our offerings. While we believe there are other third parties that could drive users to our online offerings, adding or transitioning to them may disrupt our business and increase our costs, and may require us to modify, limit or discontinue certain offerings. Furthermore, sports leagues, teams and venues may enter into exclusive partnerships with our competitors which could adversely affect our ability to offer certain types of wagers. In the event that any of our existing relationships or our future relationships fail to provide services to us in accordance with the terms of our arrangement, or at all, and we are not able to find suitable alternatives, this could impact our ability to cost effectively attract consumers and harm our online betting and gaming business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nThe growth of our digital business will require investments in our online offerings, technology and strategic marketing initiatives, which could be costly and negatively impact the economics of our online business.\nThe online betting and gaming industry is subject to rapid and frequent changes in standards, technologies, products and service offerings, as well as in customer demands and preferences and regulations, which will require us to continually introduce and successfully implement new and innovative technologies, marketing strategies, product offerings and enhancements to remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand, acceptance and engagement. The process of developing new online offerings and systems is inherently complex and uncertain, and new offerings may not be well received by users, even if they are well-reviewed and of high quality. Developing new offerings and marketing strategies can also divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities. New online offerings that attain market acceptance and aggressive marketing strategies implemented in the competitive online market environment could impact the mix of our existing business, including our casino business, or the share of our patron’s wallets in a manner that could negatively impact our results of operations. In addition, online betting and gaming operates in a competitive environment that requires significant investment in marketing initiatives, including free play and use of a variety of free and paid marketing channels, including television, radio, social media platforms, such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and other digital channels. We cannot be sure that our investments in technology, products, service offerings and marketing initiatives will be successful or generate the return on investment that we expect. If new or existing competitors offer more attractive offerings or engage in marketing initiatives that are better received by customers, we may lose users or users may decrease their spending on our offerings. Further, new customer demands, superior competitive offerings, new industry standards or changes in the regulatory environment could render our offerings unattractive, unmarketable or obsolete and require us to make substantial unanticipated changes to our technology or business model. Failure to adapt to a rapidly changing market or evolving customer demands, and costs required to be incurred to react to dynamic market conditions, could harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\n18\nWe face the risk of fraud, theft, and cheating.\nWe face the risk that gaming customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft or cheat in order to increase winnings. Such acts of fraud, theft, or cheating could involve the use of counterfeit chips or other tactics, possibly in collusion with our employees. Internal acts of cheating could also be conducted by employees through collusion with dealers, surveillance staff, floor managers, or other casino or gaming area staff. Additionally, we also face the risk that customers may attempt or commit fraud or theft with respect to our non-gaming offerings or against other customers. Such risks include stolen credit or charge cards or cash, falsified checks, theft of retail inventory and purchased goods, and unpaid or counterfeit receipts. Failure to discover such acts or schemes in a timely manner could result in losses in our operations. Negative publicity related to such acts or schemes could have an adverse effect on our reputation, potentially causing a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows.\nWe extend credit to a portion of our customers, and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables from our credit customers.\nWe conduct our gaming activities on a credit and cash basis. Any such credit we extend is unsecured. High-stakes players typically are extended more credit than customers who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular period. We extend credit to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. These large receivables could have a significant impact on our results of operations if deemed uncollectible. Gaming debts evidenced by a credit instrument, including what is commonly referred to as a “marker,” and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of the jurisdictions in which we allow play on a credit basis, and judgments on gaming debts in such jurisdictions are enforceable in all U.S. states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution; however, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from U.S. courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nIn addition, in November 2017, the Chinese government adopted new rules to control the cross-border transportation of cash and bearer negotiable instruments, specifically to reduce the international transfer of cash in connection with activities that are illegal in China, including gambling. The Chinese government has recently taken steps to prohibit the transfer of cash for the payment of gaming debts. These developments may have the effect of reducing the collectability of gaming debts of players from China. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect or become more restrictive in the future. These and any future foreign currency control policy developments that may be implemented by foreign jurisdictions could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nActs of terrorism, war, natural disasters, severe weather, and political, economic and military conditions may impede our ability to operate or may negatively impact our financial results.\nTerrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties. For example, a substantial number of the customers of our properties in Las Vegas use air travel. As a result of terrorist acts that occurred on September 11, 2001, domestic and international travel was severely disrupted, which resulted in a decrease in customer visits to our properties in Las Vegas. Visitation to Las Vegas also declined for a period of time following the mass shooting tragedy on October 1, 2017. We cannot predict the extent to which disruptions in air or other forms of travel as a result of any further terrorist act, security alerts or war, uprisings, or hostilities in places such as Iraq, Afghanistan, Ukraine, and/or Syria or other countries throughout the world, and governmental responses to those acts or hostilities, will directly or indirectly impact our business and operating results. For example, our operations in Cairo, Egypt, were negatively affected from the uprising there in January 2011. A third party that is responsible for our player account management has employees in Ukraine and negative developments in Ukraine could negatively impact our digital business. As a consequence of the threat of terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility in the future, premiums for a variety of insurance products have increased, and some types of insurance are no longer available. If any such event were to affect our properties, we would likely be adversely affected.\nIn addition, natural and man-made disasters such as major fires, floods, severe snowstorms, hurricanes, earthquakes, and oil spills could also adversely impact our business and operating results. Such events could lead to the loss of use of one or more of our properties for an extended period of time and disrupt our ability to attract customers to certain of our gaming facilities. For example, our property in Lake Charles, Louisiana has been closed since August 27, 2020 due to damage resulting from Hurricane Laura. Inadequate insurance or lack of available insurance for these and other certain types or levels of risk could expose us to significant losses in the event that a catastrophe occurred for which we are underinsured. In most cases, we have insurance that covers portions of any losses from a natural disaster, but it is subject to deductibles and maximum payouts in many cases. Although we may be covered by insurance from a natural disaster, the timing of our receipt of insurance proceeds,\n19\nif any, may be out of our control. In some cases, however, we may receive no proceeds from insurance. Further, if properties subject to our leases with VICI and GLPI are impacted by a casualty event, such leases require us to repair or restore the affected properties even if the cost of such repair or restoration exceeds the insurance proceeds that we receive. Under such circumstances, the rent under such leases is required to be paid during the period of repair or restoration even if all or a portion of the affected property is not operating. In addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of the casualty event or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry general liability insurance and business interruption insurance, there can be no assurance that insurance will be available or adequate to cover all loss and damage to which our business or our assets might be subjected and the timing and receipt of insurance proceeds, if any, may be out of our control.\nOur business may be subject to fluctuations due to seasonality and other factors that could result in volatility and have an adverse effect on our operating results.\nOur business may fluctuate due to seasonality and other factors. Our casino business is impacted by weather conditions that may deter or prevent customers from reaching the facilities or undertaking trips, which would particularly affect customers who are traveling longer distances to visit our properties. Our casino business can also fluctuate due to specific holidays or other significant events, such as Easter (particularly when the holiday falls in a different quarter than the prior year), the World Series of Poker tournament (with respect to our Las Vegas properties), city-wide conventions, a large sporting event or a concert, or visits by our premium players. Our sportsbook business may also be impacted by availability or scheduling of major sporting events or the cancellation or postponement of sporting events or races, including lockouts, strikes or similar disruptions. For example, our sports betting business could be adversely impacted if the 2022 Major League Baseball season does not begin on time or does not occur at all. Seasonality, holiday, or other significant events may affect our digital operations, properties or regions differently. These factors, among other things, could adversely affect our business, financial condition, and operating results, cause volatility in the trading price of our stock and impact our cash flow from quarter to quarter.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues. We may be indirectly impacted by regulatory requirements aimed at reducing the impacts of climate change directed at up-stream utility providers, as we could experience potentially higher utility, fuel, and transportation costs.\nAny deterioration in our reputation or the reputation of our brands could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations.\nOur business is dependent on the quality and reputation of our Company and brands. Events beyond our control could affect the reputation of one or more of our properties, including our digital operations, or more generally impact our corporate or brand image. Other factors that could influence our reputation include the quality of the services we offer and our actions with regard to social issues such as diversity, human rights and support for local communities. Broad access to social media makes it easy for anyone to provide public feedback that can influence perceptions of us, our brands or our properties. It may be difficult to control or effectively manage negative publicity, regardless of whether it is accurate. Negative events and publicity could quickly and materially damage perceptions of us, our brands or our properties, which, in turn, could adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations through loss of customers, loss of business opportunities, lack of acceptance of our company to operate in host communities, employee retention or recruiting difficulties or other difficulties.\nRisks Relating to Information Systems and Technology\nCompromises of our information systems or unauthorized access to confidential information or our customers’ personal information could materially harm our reputation and business.\nWe collect and store confidential, personal information relating to our customers for various business purposes, including marketing and financial purposes, and credit card information for processing payments. For example, we handle, collect and store personal information in connection with our customers staying at our hotels and enrolling in Caesars Rewards. We may share this personal and confidential information with vendors or other third parties in connection with processing of transactions, operating certain aspects of our business, or for marketing purposes. Our collection and use of personal data are governed by state and federal privacy laws and regulations as well as the applicable laws and regulations in other countries in which we operate. Privacy law is subject to frequent changes and varies significantly by jurisdiction. We may incur significant costs in order to ensure compliance with the various applicable privacy requirements. In addition, privacy laws and regulations may limit our ability to market to our customers.\n20\nWe assess and monitor the security of collection, storage, and transmission of customer information on an ongoing basis. We utilize commercially available software and technologies to monitor, assess and secure our network. Further, some of the systems currently used for transmission and approval of payment card transactions and the technology utilized in payment cards themselves, all of which can put payment card data at risk, are determined and controlled by the payment card industry, and other such systems are determined and controlled by us. Although we have taken steps designed to safeguard our customers’ confidential personal information and important internal company data, our network and other systems and those of third parties, such as service providers, could be compromised, damaged, or disrupted by a third-party breach of our system security or that of a third-party provider or as a result of purposeful or accidental actions of third parties, our employees, or those employees of a third party, power outages, computer viruses, system failures, natural disasters, or other catastrophic events. Our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cybersecurity similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. Advances in computer and software capabilities, encryption technology, new tools, and other developments may increase the risk of a security breach. As a result of any security breach, customer information or other proprietary data may be accessed or transmitted by or to a third party. Despite the measures we have implemented to safeguard our information, there can be no assurance that we are adequately protecting our information.\nAny loss, disclosure of, misappropriation of, or access to customers’ or other proprietary information or other breach of our information security could result in legal claims or legal proceedings, including regulatory investigations and actions, or liability for failure to comply with privacy and information security laws, including for failure to protect personal information or for misusing personal information, which could disrupt our operations, damage our reputation, and expose us to claims from customers, financial institutions, regulators, payment card associations, employees, and other persons, any of which could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, and cash flow.\nWe have cybersecurity insurance to respond to a breach which is designed to cover expenses around notification, credit monitoring, investigation, crisis management, public relations and legal advice. We also carry other insurance which may cover ancillary aspects of the event; however, damage and claims arising from a breach may not be completely covered or may exceed the amount of any insurance available.\nOur operations, and particularly our digital betting and gaming operations, are reliant on information technology and other systems and services, and any failures, errors, defects or disruptions in our systems or services could adversely affect our operations.\nOur technology infrastructure is critical to the performance of our digital betting and gaming operations and to user satisfaction and we rely significantly on our computer systems and software to receive and properly process internal and external data, including data related to Caesars Rewards. We devote significant resources to our technology infrastructure, but our systems may not be adequate to avoid performance delays or outages that could be harmful to our online business. In addition, we cannot assure you that the measures we take to prevent cyber-attacks and protect our systems, data and user information and to prevent outages, data or information loss, fraud and to prevent or detect security breaches will be sufficient to ensure uninterrupted operation of our digital platform and provide absolute security. We have experienced, and we may in the future experience, website disruptions, outages and other performance problems due to a variety of factors, including infrastructure changes, human or software errors and capacity constraints. Disruptions from unauthorized access to, fraudulent manipulation of, or tampering with our computer systems and technological infrastructure, or those of third parties that provide support to our operations, could result in a wide range of negative outcomes, each of which could materially adversely affect the operation of our online business and our financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nAdditionally, our computer systems and software may fail or may contain errors, bugs, flaws or corrupted data, and these defects may only become apparent after the launch of our online products. These types of issues could disrupt our operations or render a product unavailable when users attempt to access it or cause access to our offerings to be slower than our users expect. Inaccessibility or slow access to our products could make users less likely to return to our digital platform as often, if at all, or to recommend our offerings to other potential users, which could harm our brand perception, cause our users to stop utilizing our online offerings, divert our resources and delay market acceptance of our online offerings.\nWe expect that we will continue to expand our online betting and gaming offerings as our user base grows and we enter into new markets, which will require an enhancement of our technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, to support the growth of our digital business and to satisfy our users’ needs. Such infrastructure expansion may be complex and costly, and unanticipated delays in completing these projects or availability of components may lead to increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, or interruptions in the delivery or degradation of the quality of our offerings. In addition, there may be issues related to our online infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases of design and implementation and become evident after we have started to fully use the underlying equipment or software, which could impact the user experience or increase our costs. An inability to effectively scale our technical infrastructure to accommodate increased demands could adversely impact our ability to grow our digital betting and gaming business.\n21\nOur online business is dependent on the Internet and we rely on Amazon Web Services and other third-party technology, platforms and services to deliver our offerings to users.\nA substantial portion of the infrastructure that is required to enable users to access our digital betting and gaming offerings is provided by third parties, including Internet service providers and other technology-based service providers. In particular, we currently host our online betting and gaming offerings and support our operations using Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and other third-party technology, platforms and services. Our third-party providers may experience service interruptions, delays, outages or damage, including due to capacity constraints, an event causing an unusually high volume of Internet use (such as a pandemic or public health emergency), infrastructure changes or upgrades (such as 5G or 6G services), human or software errors, website hosting disruptions, natural disasters, cybersecurity attacks, terrorist attacks, power outages and similar events or acts of misconduct. We exercise little control over our third-party providers and any difficulties that these providers experience, including the potential of certain network traffic receiving priority over other traffic (i.e., lack of net neutrality), may adversely affect our business. Because our ability to provide our users with continuing and uninterrupted access to our platform is critical to the success of our digital business, we use our best efforts to ensure that our facilities and infrastructure and the facilities and infrastructure of our third-party providers support our current and expected operations and are designed to mitigate the impacts of system malfunctions. Nevertheless, there can be no guarantee that such systems will be able to meet the demand of our current and future digital business, the overall online betting and gaming industry and the growth of the Internet. Furthermore, if we do not maintain business relationships with our third-party providers, and in particular, AWS, we may not be able to secure required third-party services on terms that are acceptable to us or on an acceptable time frame. Any of these risks could result in a loss of revenue and cause us to incur unexpected costs that could be significant, which could have a material adverse effect on our online business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nOur online business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our apps and the major mobile operating systems and upon third-party platforms for the distribution of our product offerings, which depend on factors beyond our control such as the design of third-party operating systems and continued access to our apps on third-party distribution platforms like the Apple App Store.\nOur digital business is dependent on the interoperability of our technology with popular mobile operating systems, technologies, networks and standards as our users access our online betting and gaming product offerings primarily on mobile devices. As a result, our business model depends upon the continued compatibility between our app and the major mobile operating systems, such as the Android and iOS operating systems, and we rely upon third-party platforms for distribution of our product offerings. We do not have formal or informal relationships with parties that control design of mobile devices and operating systems and there is no guarantee that popular mobile devices will start or continue to support or feature our product offerings. Any changes, bugs, technical or regulatory issues in such operating systems, our relationships with mobile manufacturers and carriers, or in their terms of service or policies that degrade our offerings’ functionality, reduce or eliminate our ability to distribute our offerings, give preferential treatment to competitive products, limit our ability to deliver high quality offerings, or impose fees or other charges related to delivering our offerings, could adversely affect our product usage and monetization on mobile devices. In addition, if any of the third-party platforms used for distribution of our product offerings were to limit or disable the availability of our app or advertising on their platforms, our ability to generate revenue could be harmed. These changes could materially impact the way we do business, and if we are unable to adjust to those changes quickly and effectively, there could be an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and prospects.\nRisks Related to Human Capital\nWe rely on our key personnel and we may face difficulties in attracting and retaining qualified employees for our casinos and race tracks.\nOur future success will depend upon, among other things, our ability to keep our senior executives and highly qualified employees. The operation of our business requires, qualified executives, managers and skilled employees with gaming and horse racing industry experience and qualifications who are able to obtain the requisite licenses and approval from the applicable gaming authorities. We compete with other potential employers for employees, and we may not succeed in hiring or retaining the executives and other employees that we need. A sudden loss of or inability to replace key employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, there has from time to time been a shortage of skilled labor in our markets and the continued expansion of gaming near our facilities, including the expansion of Native American gaming and internet betting and gaming, may make it more difficult for us to attract qualified candidates. While we believe that we will continue to be able to attract and retain qualified employees, shortages of skilled labor will make it increasingly difficult and expensive to attract and retain the services of a satisfactory number of qualified employees, and we may incur higher costs than expected as a result.\n22\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively impact our future profits.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had collective bargaining agreements covering approximately 23,000 employees. A lengthy strike or other work stoppages at any of our casino properties could have an adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nFrom time to time, we have also experienced attempts by labor organizations to organize certain of our non-union employees. These efforts have achieved some success to date. We cannot provide any assurance that we will not experience additional and successful union activity in the future. The impact of this union activity is undetermined and could negatively impact our results of operations.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers and other entertainment offerings on acceptable terms or at all.\nHistorically, our performers have drawn customers to our properties and have been a significant source of our revenue. We cannot assure you that we will be able to retain our performers or other shows on acceptable terms or at all. In addition, the third parties that we depend on for our properties’ entertainment offerings may become incapable or unwilling to provide their services at the level agreed upon or at all. Disruptions in the performance schedule can leave us without entertainment offerings, which could negatively impact our business.\nRisks Relating to Our Capital Structure\nOur substantial indebtedness and the fact that a significant portion of our cash flow is used to make interest payments and rent payments under our debt and lease agreements could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund our operations, limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry and prevent us from making debt service payments and rent payments.\nAs of December 31, 2021 we had $14.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness, in addition to leases with VICI and GLPI that require an annual rent payment of $1.2 billion in 2022 and that are subject to annual escalation. See Note 10 for a description of our obligations under our leases with VICI and GLPI and Note 12 for details regarding our debt outstanding and related restrictive covenants. As a result, a significant portion of our cash flow is applied to make interest payments with respect to our outstanding debt and payments under our leases. These financial obligations may have important negative consequences for us, including:\n•\nlimiting our ability to use operating cash flow in other areas of our business because we must dedicate a significant portion of these funds to make payments on our debt and lease obligations;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our businesses and the markets in which we operate;\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors with debt and rent obligations that are less than ours;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and limiting our ability to react to, changing market conditions, COVID-19 and other public health emergencies, changes in our industry and economic downturns;\n•\nlimiting our ability to obtain additional financing to fund working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service, acquisitions, general corporate or other obligations;\n•\nsubjecting us to a number of restrictive covenants that, among other things, require us to make capital expenditures and limit our ability to pay dividends and distributions, make acquisitions and dispositions, borrow additional funds and make other investments;\n•\nexposing us to interest rate risk due to the variable interest rate on borrowings under our credit facilities; and\n•\naffecting our ability to renew gaming and other licenses necessary to conduct our business.\nCertain of our debt facilities, including the CRC Revolving Credit Facility, mature in 2022. While we expect to refinance or replace our debt facilities when they mature, we cannot be sure that we will be able to obtain financing on commercially reasonable terms.\nDespite our current indebtedness levels, we and our subsidiaries may still incur significant additional indebtedness. Incurring more indebtedness could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness.\nWe and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness, including additional secured indebtedness, and may enter into financing obligations similar to our leases with VICI and GLPI in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had $2.0 billion of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facilities, before consideration of $23 million in outstanding letters of credit and $48 million committed for regulatory purposes under our CEI Revolving Credit Facility and $69 million in outstanding letters of credit under our CRC Revolving Credit Facility. Further, our existing debt agreements currently permit,\n23\nand we expect that agreements governing debt that we incur in the future will permit, us to incur certain other additional secured and unsecured debt. Further, we may incur other liabilities that do not constitute indebtedness. The risks that we face based on our outstanding indebtedness may intensify if we incur additional indebtedness or financing obligations in the future.\nOur variable rate indebtedness exposes us to interest rate volatility, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nBorrowings under certain of our facilities are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate volatility. If interest rates increase, our debt service obligations on certain of our variable rate indebtedness will increase even though the amount borrowed remains the same. In addition, at the end of 2021, the administrator for London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) ceased publishing one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and will cease publishing all remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors in mid-2023. Concurrently, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority announced the cessation or loss of representativeness of the U.S. dollar LIBOR tenors from those dates. While we continue to monitor market developments to assess replacement rate options, the consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and may result in the level of interest payments on the portion of our indebtedness that bears interest at variable rates to be affected, which may adversely impact the amount of our interest payments under such debt.\nA significant portion of our casinos are located on leased property. If we default on one or more leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected casino.\nWe currently lease certain parcels of land on which a significant portion of our properties are located. As a ground lessee, we have the right to use the leased land; however, we do not hold fee ownership of the underlying land. Accordingly, we have no interest in the leased land or improvements thereon at the expiration of the ground leases. If our use of the land underlying our casino properties is disrupted permanently or for a significant period of time, then the value of our assets could be impaired and our business and operations could be adversely affected. Our leases provide that they may be terminated for a number of reasons, including failure to pay rent, taxes or other payment obligations or the breach of other covenants contained in the leases. In particular, our leases with GLPI and VICI require annual rent payments of $1.2 billion in 2022, which is subject to escalation annually, and obligate us to make specified minimum capital expenditures with respect to the leased properties. If our business and properties fail to generate sufficient earnings, the payments required to service the rent obligations under our leases with GLPI and VICI could materially and adversely limit our ability to react to changes in our business and make acquisitions and investments in our properties. If we were to default on any one or more of these leases, the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land, including the hotels and casinos. A termination of our ground leases or our leases with GLPI or VICI could result in a default under our debt agreements and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Further, in the event that any lessor of our leased properties, including GLPI or VICI, encounters financial, operational, regulatory or other challenges, there can be no assurance that such lessor will be able to comply with its obligations under the applicable lease.\nCertain of our leases, including our leases with GLPI and VICI, are “triple-net” leases. Accordingly, in addition to rent, we are required to pay, among other things, the following: (1) lease payments to the underlying ground lessor for properties that are subject to ground leases; (2) facility maintenance costs; (3) all insurance premiums for insurance with respect to the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties; (4) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor); and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for incurring the costs described in the preceding sentence notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall in part accrue to the lessor as the owner of the associated facilities. In addition, we remain obligated for lease payments and other obligations under our leases with GLPI and VICI and other ground leases even if one or more of such leased facilities is unprofitable or if we decide to withdraw from those locations. We could incur special charges relating to the closing of such facilities including lease termination costs, impairment charges and other special charges that would reduce our net income and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation, taxation policies and licensing, and gaming authorities have significant control over our operations, which could have an adverse effect on our business.\nLicensing Requirements\n. The ownership and operation of casino gaming, online betting and gaming, riverboat and horse racing facilities are subject to extensive federal, state and local regulation, and regulatory authorities at local, state and national levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of gaming businesses. We currently hold all state and local licenses and related approvals necessary to conduct our present gaming operations, but we must periodically apply to renew many of our licenses and registrations. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such renewals. Any failure to maintain or renew our\n24\nexisting licenses, registrations, permits or approvals would have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, we are required to provide information relating to our operations to various gaming regulatory agencies. A failure to provide accurate information could result in the imposition of fines or other penalties by the relevant regulatory authority. Furthermore, if additional laws or regulations are adopted or existing laws or regulations are amended or interpreted differently, these regulations could impose additional restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us.\nGaming authorities with jurisdiction over our operations may, in their discretion, require the holder of any securities issued by us to file applications, be investigated, and be found suitable to own our securities, and, if a holder is found unsuitable, we can be sanctioned, including the loss of approvals that are required for us to continue our gaming operations in the relevant jurisdictions, if such unsuitable person does not timely sell our securities. Our officers, directors and key employees are also subject to similar findings of unsuitability and the gaming authorities may require us to terminate the employment of any person who refuses to file appropriate applications. See “Item 1 - Gaming Licenses and Governmental Regulations” and Exhibit 99.1 for further description of the regulations to which we are subject. We may be required under applicable gaming laws and regulations to obtain approval of applicable gaming authorities to issue securities, incur debt and undertake other financing activities and our financing counterparties, including lenders, might be subject to various licensing and related approval procedures in the various jurisdictions in which we operate gaming facilities.\nCompliance with Other Laws\n. We are also subject to a variety of other federal, state and local laws, rules, regulations and ordinances that apply to non-gaming businesses, including restrictions enacted in response to COVD-19, zoning, environmental, construction and land-use laws and regulations governing smoking and the serving of alcoholic beverages. Our operations have been adversely impacted by regulations enacted to limit the spread of COVID-19. In addition, legislation in various forms to ban indoor tobacco smoking has been enacted or introduced in many states and local jurisdictions, including several of the jurisdictions in which we operate. If additional restrictions are enacted in our jurisdictions, we could experience a significant decrease in gaming revenue and operating results at our properties and, particularly if such restrictions are not applicable to all competitive facilities in that gaming market, our business could be materially adversely affected. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any additional limitations on our operations would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.\nRegulations adopted by FINCEN require us to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000 occurring within a gaming day. U.S. Treasury Department regulations also require us to report certain suspicious activity, including any transaction that exceeds $5,000, if we know, suspect or have reason to believe that the transaction involves funds from illegal activity or is designed to evade federal regulations or reporting requirements. Substantial penalties can be imposed if we fail to comply with these regulations. FINCEN has recently increased its focus on gaming companies.\nWe are required to report certain customer’s gambling winnings via form W-2G to comply with current Internal Revenue Service regulations. Should these regulations change, we would expect to incur additional costs to comply with the revised reporting requirements.\nTaxation and Fees\n. In addition, gaming companies are generally subject to significant revenue-based taxes and fees in addition to normal federal, state and local income taxes, and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time. We pay substantial taxes and fees with respect to our operations. Tax laws are dynamic and subject to change as new laws are passed and new interpretations of the law are issued or applied, affecting the gaming industry. The large number of state and local governments with significant current or projected budget deficits makes it more likely that those governments that currently permit gaming will seek to fund such deficits with new or increased gaming taxes and/or property taxes and worsening economic conditions could intensify those efforts. Any material increase, or the adoption of additional taxes or fees, could have a material adverse effect on our future financial results.\nThe growth of our online betting and gaming business will depend on expansion of online betting and gaming into new jurisdictions and our ability to obtain required licenses.\nOur ability to achieve growth in our online betting and gaming business will depend, in large part, upon expansion of online betting and gaming into new jurisdictions, the terms of regulations relating to online betting and gaming and our ability to obtain required licenses. Following the 2018 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the federal ban on sports betting, a number of jurisdictions have legalized sports betting and online gaming and we expect that additional jurisdictions may do so in the future. Our ability to further expand our sports betting and online operations is dependent on the adoption of regulations permitting such activities. However, the expansion of betting and online gaming in new jurisdictions is dependent on a number of factors that are beyond our control and there can be no assurances of when, or if, such regulations will be adopted or the terms of such regulations, including restrictions, tax rates and license fees and availability of such licenses to casino owners exclusively or at all.\n25\nWe may not be able to protect the intellectual property rights we own or may be prevented from using intellectual property necessary for our business.\nThe development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. We rely primarily on trade secret, trademark, domain name, copyright, and contract law to protect the intellectual property and proprietary technology we own. We also actively pursue business opportunities in the United States and in international jurisdictions involving the licensing of our trademarks to third parties. It is possible that third parties may copy or otherwise obtain and use our intellectual property or proprietary technology without authorization or otherwise infringe on our rights. For example, while we have a policy of entering into confidentiality, intellectual property invention assignment, and/or non-competition and non-solicitation agreements or restrictions with our employees, independent contractors, and business partners, such agreements may not provide adequate protection or may be breached, or our proprietary technology may otherwise become available to or be independently developed by our competitors. In addition, the laws of some foreign countries may not protect proprietary rights or intellectual property to as great an extent as do the laws of the United States. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, the unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our trademarks and our market acceptance, competitive advantages, or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nOur technology contains software modules licensed to us by third-party authors under “open source” licenses. Use and distribution of open source software may entail greater risks than use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide support, warranties, indemnification or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims or the quality of the code. In addition, the public availability of such software may make it easier for others to compromise our technology and, under certain open source licenses, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary software to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar offerings with lower development effort and time and ultimately could result in a loss of our competitive advantages.\nThird parties have alleged and may in the future allege that we are infringing, misappropriating, or otherwise violating their intellectual property rights. Third parties may initiate litigation against us without warning or may send us letters or other communications that make allegations without initiating litigation. We may elect not to respond to these letters or other communications if we believe they are without merit, or we may attempt to resolve these disputes out of court by negotiating a license, but in either case it is possible that such disputes will ultimately result in litigation. Any such claims could interfere with our ability to use technology or intellectual property that is material to the operation of our business. Such claims may be made by competitors seeking to obtain a competitive advantage or by other parties, such as entities that purchase intellectual property assets for the purpose of bringing infringement claims. We also periodically employ individuals who were previously employed by our competitors or potential competitors, and we may therefore be subject to claims that such employees have used or disclosed the alleged trade secrets or other proprietary information of their former employers.\nWe may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, protect our trade secrets, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others, or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity, including with respect to technology that we believe to be “open source”. Any such litigation could result in substantial costs and the diversion of resources and the attention of management. If unsuccessful, such litigation could result in the loss of important intellectual property rights, require us to pay substantial damages, subject us to injunctions that prevent us from using certain intellectual property, require us to make admissions that affect our reputation in the marketplace, or require us to enter into license agreements that may not be available on favorable terms, re-engineer our technology or discontinue or delay the provision of our offerings. Finally, even if we prevail in any litigation, the remedy may not be commercially meaningful or fully compensate us for the harm we suffer or the costs we incur. Any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely on licenses to use the intellectual property rights of third parties which are incorporated into our products and services. Failure to renew or expand existing licenses may require us to modify, limit or discontinue certain offerings.\nWe rely on products, technologies and intellectual property that we license from third parties, for use in our business-to-business and business-to-consumers offerings. Certain of our offerings and services use intellectual property licensed from third parties and we expect that our future products will require the use of third-party intellectual property. The future success of our business may depend, in part, on our ability to obtain, retain and/or expand licenses for popular technologies and games in a competitive market. We cannot assure that third-party licenses that may be necessary or desirable for the operation of our products, or support for such licensed products and technologies, will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms, if at all. If we are unable to renew and/or expand existing licenses or obtain new licenses, including as a result of reluctance of third parties to subject themselves to regulatory review that may be required to operate as our supplier, we may be required to discontinue or limit our use of the products that include or incorporate the licensed intellectual property, which could adversely impact our business, results of operations and prospects.\n26\nWe are or may become involved in legal proceedings that, if adversely adjudicated or settled, could impact our business and financial condition.\nFrom time to time, we are named in lawsuits or other legal proceedings relating to our respective businesses. Some of these matters involve commercial or contractual disputes, intellectual property claims, legal compliance, personal injury claims, and employment claims. As with all legal proceedings, no assurances can be given as to the outcome of these matters. Moreover, legal proceedings can be expensive and time consuming, and we may not be successful in defending or prosecuting these lawsuits, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe cannot be sure that we will be able to dispose of the William Hill non-US operations on terms and conditions that are satisfactory to us or at all.\nWe previously announced that on September 9, 2021 we entered into an agreement to sell the William Hill International operations to 888 Holdings Plc (“888”) and that we intend to apply the proceeds of such sale to repay outstanding indebtedness. The transaction remains subject to the satisfaction of a number of conditions, most notably 888’s publication of a prospectus and shareholder circular recommending shareholder approval of the transaction, and receipt of that approval from 888’s shareholders. There can be no assurance that the transaction will be completed on the previously agreed upon terms and timeline, or that we will be able to consummate a sale of William Hill International in the near future or at all. If we do not expect the closing of the sale of William Hill International by October 14, 2022, the date in which the Bridge Credit Agreement matures, we expect to refinance the outstanding indebtedness under the Bridge Credit Agreement. We cannot guarantee the success of such refinancing."

As of February 17, 2022, there were approximately 321 holders of record of our common stock.\nWe have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock. We intend to retain all of our earnings to finance the development of our business, and thus, do not anticipate paying cash dividends on our common stock for the foreseeable future. Payment of any cash dividends in the future will be at the discretion of our Board and will depend upon, among other things, our future earnings, operations and capital requirements, our general financial condition, general business conditions and restrictions that may be in place under our borrowing arrangements or existing lease agreements.\nEquity Compensation Plan Information\nWe maintain long-term incentive plans which allow for granting stock-based compensation awards for directors, employees, officers, and consultants or advisers who render services to the Company or its subsidiaries, based on Company Common Stock, including performance-based and incentive stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”), market-based stock units (“MSUs”), stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalents. See Note 15 for a description of our stock-based compensation plans.\nThe following table sets forth information as of December 31, 2021, with respect to compensation plans under which equity securities that we have authorized for issuance.\n___________________\n(1)\nIncludes (i) 43,905 shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $20.69 and (ii) 2,889,599 unvested RSUs, PSUs, and MSUs.\n(2)\nRSUs, PSUs, and MSUs do not have an exercise price and therefore are not included in the calculation of the weighted-average exercise price.\nChanges to the Authorized Shares\nOn June 17, 2021, following receipt of required shareholder approvals, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from 300 million to 500 million, and authorize the issuance of up to 150 million shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021, no shares of preferred stock have been issued.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn November 2018, our Board authorized a common stock repurchase program of up to $150 million of stock (the “Share Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which we may, from time to time, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market (either with or without a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that we are required to repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have acquired 223,823 shares of common stock under this program since 2018 at an aggregate value of $9 million and an average of $40.80 per share. No shares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nTransactions Related to Convertible Notes issued by Former Caesars\nPrior to the Merger, Former Caesars issued $1.1 billion aggregate principal amount of 5% convertible senior notes maturing in 2024 (the “5% Convertible Notes”). The 5% Convertible Notes were convertible into the weighted average of the number of shares of Company Common Stock and an amount of cash actually received per share by holders of common stock of Former\n30\nCaesars that made elections for consideration in the Merger. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company converted the remaining outstanding aggregate principal amount of the 5% Convertible Notes, which resulted in cash payments of $367 million, net of approximately $12 million paid into our trust accounts, and the issuance of approximately 5 million shares of Company Common Stock.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNone.\nStock Performance Graph\nThe graph depicted below compares the cumulative total stockholder return on our common stock with the cumulative total return on the Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index (“S&P 500”) and the Dow Jones U.S. Gambling Total Stock Market Index (“Dow Jones U.S. Gambling”) for the period beginning on December 31, 2016 and ending on December 31, 2021.

These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from those contained in or implied by any forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors—CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS,” of this report.\nObjective\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (“MD&A”) is intended to be a narrative explanation of the financial statements and other statistical data that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying financial statements to enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial condition, changes in financial condition and results of operations. Our objectives are: (i) to provide a narrative explanation of our financial statements that will enable investors to see the Company through the eyes of management; (ii) to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the context within which financial information should be analyzed; and (iii) to provide information about the quality of, and potential variability of, our earnings and cash flows so that investors can ascertain the likelihood that past performance is indicative of future performance.\nOverview\nWe are a geographically diversified gaming and hospitality company that was founded in 1973 by the Carano family with the opening of the Eldorado Hotel Casino in Reno, Nevada. Beginning in 2005, we grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (“Isle” or “Isle of Capri”) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018. On July 20, 2020, we completed the merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (“Former Caesars”) pursuant to which Former Caesars became our wholly-owned subsidiary (the “Merger”) and our ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market changed from “ERI” to “CZR”.\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for\n£2.9 billion\n, or approximately\n$3.9 billion (the “William Hill Acquisition”).\nWe currently own, lease or manage an aggregate of 52 domestic properties in 16 states with approximately 55,700 slot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately 2,900 table games and approximately 47,700 hotel rooms as of December 31, 2021. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. Our primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties’ gaming operations, retail and online sports betting as well as online gaming, and we utilize hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to our properties.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned 20 of our casinos and leased 26 casinos in the U.S. We lease 18 casinos from VICI Properties L.P., a Delaware limited partnership (“VICI”) pursuant to a regional lease, a Las Vegas lease and a Joliet lease. In addition, we lease seven casinos from GLP Capital, L.P., the operating partnership of Gaming and Leisure Properties, Inc. (“GLPI”) pursuant to a Master Lease (as amended, the “GLPI Master Lease”) and a Lumière lease (together with the GLPI Master Lease, the “GLPI Leases”). Additionally, we lease the Rio All-Suite Hotel & Casino from a separate third party. See descriptions under the “GLPI Leases” and “VICI Leases.”\n32\nWe also operate and conduct sports wagering across 21 states and domestic jurisdictions, 14 of which are mobile for sports betting, and operate regulated online real money gaming in five states. Our recently launched Caesars Sportsbook app operates on the Liberty platform, which we acquired in the William Hill Acquisition along with other technology platforms that we intend to migrate to the Liberty platform in the future, subject to required approvals. The map below illustrates Caesars Digital’s presence as of December 31, 2021:\nSubsequent to December 31, 2021, we launched mobile sports betting on our Liberty platform in New York on January 8, 2022 and Louisiana on January 28, 2022 and went live with retail sports betting in Washington on February 10, 2022. We are also in the process of expanding our Caesars Digital footprint into other states in the near term.\n33\nWe periodically divest of assets in order to raise capital or as a result of a determination that the assets are not core to our business. We also divested certain assets in connection with obtaining regulatory approvals related to closing of the Merger. A summary of recently completed and planned divestitures of our properties as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n____________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\n(a)\nMountaineer, Cape Girardeau and Caruthersville were sold for aggregate consideration of $385 million.\n(b)\nKansas City and Vicksburg were sold for aggregate consideration of $230 million.\n(c)\nThe proceeds of this sale were split between the Company and VICI.\nSee Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data — Note 4 for further discussion on these key transactions and any applicable gain (loss) or impairment charges recorded.\nMerger and Acquisitions Related Activities\nAcquisition of William Hill\nOn September 30, 2020, we announced that we had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which we would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by us or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition for\n£2.9 billion\n, or approximately\n$3.9 billion\n.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day £1.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day £116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Debt Financing”). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The £1.5 billion Interim Facilities Agreement (“Interim Facilities Agreement”) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, the Company repaid the £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full £116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of £700 million. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill’s non-U.S. operations including the UK and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, “William Hill International”), all of which are held for sale and reflected within\n34\ndiscontinued operations. Certain investments acquired will be excluded from the held for sale group.\nOn September 8, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately £2.2 billion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, and other working capital adjustments, the Company expects to receive approximately £835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction cost associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were associated with legal and professional services and were recorded in Transaction costs and other operating costs in our Statements of Operations.\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\nOn August 26, 2021, we increased our ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC (“Horseshoe Baltimore”), a property which we also managed, to approximately 75.8% for cash consideration of $55 million. We were subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and have consolidated the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. As a result of the increase in our ownership interest, our previously held investment was remeasured and we recognized a gain of $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021. Management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within our Managed and Branded segment. Operations following the consolidation event are presented within our Regional segment.\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of ours. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n•\nCreation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets\n•\nDiversification of the Company’s domestic footprint\n•\nAccess to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience\n•\nRealization of significant identified synergies\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $10.9 billion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nInvestments and Partnerships\nNeoGames\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. (“NeoGames”), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, the Company sold a portion of its shares of NeoGames common stock for $136 million which decreased its ownership interest from 24.5% to approximately 8.4%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately 2 million shares of NeoGames common stock with a fair value of $60 million. The shares have a readily determinable fair value and, accordingly, the Company remeasures the investment based on the publicly available share price (Level 1). For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss to the investment in NeoGames of $54 million, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nThe Stars Group/Flutter Entertainment\nIn November 2018, the Company entered into a 20-year agreement with The Stars Group Inc. (“TSG”) pursuant to which we agreed to provide TSG with options to obtain access to our second skin for online sports wagering and third skin for real money online gaming and poker, in each case with respect to states in which our properties are located. Under the terms of the agreement, we received 1 million TSG common shares. The fair value of the shares received was deferred and was recognized as revenue on a straight-line basis over the 20-year agreement term. In addition, we received a revenue share from the operation of the applicable verticals by TSG under our licenses. In December 2020, the Company sold a portion of these Flutter shares for net proceeds of $24 million.\n35\nOn July 7, 2021, the Company sold all remaining Flutter shares for $9 million. The Company recorded a loss of $1 million during the year ended December 31, 2021, which is included within Other income (loss) on our Statements of Operations.\nPompano Joint Venture\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (“Cordish”) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the Company’s Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company’s input and will submit it for the Company’s review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $3 million, for a total of $4 million in cash since the inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, the Company contributed 186 acres to the joint venture with a fair value of $61 million. Total contributions of approximately 206 acres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $69 million, and the Company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash as of December 31, 2021. We entered into a short-term lease agreement in February 2021, which we can cancel at any time, to lease back a portion of the land from the joint venture.\nWhile the Company holds a 50% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction costs and other operating costs on the Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company’s investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.\nReportable Segments\nSegment results in this MD&A are presented consistent with the way our management reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a “significant market” basis. Management views each of the Company’s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Prior to the William Hill Acquisition, our principal operating activities occurred in three regionally-focused reportable segments: Las Vegas, Regional, and Managed, International, CIE, in addition to Corporate and Other.\nThe William Hill Acquisition and rebranding of our interactive business (formerly, Caesars Interactive Entertainment “CIE” and now, inclusive of William Hill US, “Caesars Digital”) expanded our access to conduct sports wagering and iGaming gaming operations. As a result, the Company has made a change to the composition of its reportable segments. The Las Vegas and Regional segments are substantially unchanged, while the former Managed, International and CIE reportable segment has been recast for all periods presented into two segments; Caesars Digital and Managed and Branded. Accordingly, our principal operating activities occur in four reportable segments: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See Item 2. “Properties” for listing of properties by segment.\nPresentation of Financial Information\nThe financial information included in this Item 7 for the periods after our acquisitions of Former Caesars on July 20, 2020, William Hill on April 22, 2021 and of the increase in our ownership percentage and subsequent consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the acquisitions. In addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company’s sales of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. Refer to “Reportable Segments” above for a discussion of changes to the Company’s reportable segments.\nThis MD&A is intended to provide information to assist in better understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations. Our historical operating results may not be indicative of our future results of operations because of the factors described in the preceding paragraph and the changing competitive landscape in each of our markets, including changes in market and societal trends, as well as by factors discussed elsewhere herein. We recommend that you read this MD&A in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes to those statements included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the current period presentation. In June 2021, the Indiana Gaming Commission amended its order that previously required the Company to sell a third casino asset in the state of Indiana. As a result, Horseshoe Hammond no longer meets the held for sale criteria. The assets and liabilities previously held\n36\nfor sale have been reclassified as held and used for all periods presented measured at the lower of the carrying amount, adjusted for depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used, and the fair value at the date of the amended ruling. Additionally, amounts previously presented in discontinued operations have been reclassified into continuing operations for all periods presented.\nKey Performance Metrics\nOur primary source of revenue is generated by our gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming. Additionally we utilize our hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment venues, retail shops, racing and other services to attract customers to our properties. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume and quality of customers visiting and staying at our properties and using our sports betting and iGaming applications.\nKey performance metrics include volume indicators such as drop or handle, which refer to amounts wagered by our customers. The amount of volume we retain, which is not fully controllable by us, is recognized as casino revenues and is referred to as our win or hold. Slot win percentage is typically in the range of approximately 9% to 11% of slot handle for both the Las Vegas and Regional segments. Table game hold percentage is typically in the range of approximately 14% to 23% of table game drop in the Las Vegas segment and 18% to 21% of table game drop in the Regional segment. Sports betting hold is typically in the range of 5% to 9% and iGaming hold typically ranges from 3% to 4%. In addition, hotel occupancy, which is the average percentage of available hotel rooms occupied during a period, is a key indicator for our hotel business in the Las Vegas segment. See “Results of Operations” section below. Complimentary rooms are treated as occupied rooms in our calculation of hotel occupancy. The key metrics we utilize to measure our profitability and performance are Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin.\nSignificant Factors Impacting Financial Results\nThe following summary highlights the significant factors impacting our financial results during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAcquisitions and Transaction Costs\n•\nAcquisition of William Hill –\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company consummated its previously announced acquisition of the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction of\n£2.9 billion\n, or approximately\n$3.9 billion.\nWe recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $68 million and $8 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International.\n•\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\n– On August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore to approximately 75.8%. Prior to the purchase, the Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately 44.3% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the Company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and has begun to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore. As a result of the consolidation, the Company recognized a gain of $40 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n•\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation\n– The Merger closed on July 20, 2020. The Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs in connection with the Merger of $30 million, $160 million and $80 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations\n•\nDivestitures and Discontinued Operations –\nSee “Overview” section above for detail on properties divested or held for sale, including related discontinued operations.\nFinancing and Lease Transactions\n•\nDebt Transactions\n– In connection with the Merger, we issued new notes, entered into a new credit agreement and assumed certain of Former Caesars indebtedness. In addition, we terminated previously outstanding credit agreements and discharged outstanding notes. During 2021, we issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029, we repriced the Incremental CRC Term Loan, we fully converted the outstanding the 5% Convertible Notes, we purchased or redeemed the entire $1.7 billion in aggregate principal amount of outstanding CRC Notes of, and we purchased $100 million in aggregate principal amount of CEI Senior Notes. As a result of these transactions, described more fully in the Liquidity and Capital Resources section below, we experienced some interest savings subsequent to these transactions. Additionally, we recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt of $236 million and\n37\n$197 million during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which is recorded within Loss on extinguishment of debt on the Statement of Operations.\n•\nVICI Leases\n– Upon consummation of the Merger, CEI assumed obligations of certain real property assets leased from VICI by Former Caesars under various lease agreements. We recorded interest expense of $1.1 billion and $519 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the VICI Leases. Our VICI Leases also contain annual escalators based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”), with a floor of 2%.\n•\nGLPI Leases\n– We have accounted for the GLPI Leases as deferred financing obligations. We recorded interest expense in the amount of $111 million, $104 million and $99 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which was in excess of the cash lease payments as we continue to accrete up the liability during the earlier periods of the GLPI Leases. Our GLPI Leases also contain an annual escalation provision based on stated rates ranging from 1.25% to 2.0% per year.\nOther Significant Factors\n•\nCOVID-19 Public Health Emergency –\nIn January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified and has since spread throughout much of the world, including the U.S. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.\nFollowing temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the Company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. As properties began to reopen during the year ended December 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal COVID-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.\nWe experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. Although we have experienced a decline in net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. However, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. Future effects of COVID-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of Caesars Windsor from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022. Extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.\n•\nImpairment Charges –\nAs a result of COVID-19, we recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $100 million and $16 million, respectively, during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, as a result of entering agreements to sell properties in our Regional segment, impairment charges totaling $99 million were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the net sales proceeds. In December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2022. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $102 million. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.\n•\nWeather and Construction Disruption\n–\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by natural disasters including Hurricane Ida in Louisiana and Mississippi and wildfires in the Lake Tahoe area. Harrah’s New Orleans, Harrah’s Lake Tahoe and Harvey’s Lake Tahoe all experienced temporary closures which lasted slightly more than one week. Additionally, in late August 2020, our Regional segment was negatively impacted by Hurricane Laura, causing severe damage to Lake Charles, which will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be complete.\nDuring the\nyear\nended December 31, 2021\n, we\nreceived insurance proceeds of $44 million related to damaged fixed assets and remediation costs. The Company also recorded a gain of $21 million as proceeds received for the cost to replace damaged property were in excess of the respective carrying value of the assets.\n•\nCaesars Sportsbook Launch and Rebranding\n– In connection with the launch and rebranding of the Caesars Sportsbook app during the year ended December 31, 2021, our Caesars Digital segment initiated a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and other media personalities. As new states and jurisdictions\n38\nhave legalized sports betting, we have made significant upfront investment which has been executed through the marketing campaign and promotional incentives to establish ourselves as an industry leader.\n•\nPost-Merger Synergies\n– We continue to identify operating and cost efficiencies, including savings from the purchasing power of th\ne combined Caesars organization and targeted integrated marketing strategies, as well as the elimination of redundant costs such as accounting and professional expenses, certain payroll costs, and other corporate costs. As a result, we experienced margin improvements in our results of operations for the\nyear\nended December 31, 2021.\nResults of Operations\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations:\n___________________\n(a)\nCorporate and Other includes revenues related to certain licensing arrangements and various revenue sharing agreements. Corporate and Other Adjusted EBITDA includes corporate overhead costs, which consist of certain expenses, such as: payroll, professional fees and other general and administrative expenses.\n(b)\nSee the “Supplemental Unaudited Presentation of Consolidated Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”)” discussion later in this MD&A for a description of Adjusted EBITDA and a reconciliation of net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA related margins.\n(c)\nNet income (loss) margin is calculated as net income (loss) divided by net revenues.\nConsolidated comparison for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nThe following table highlights the results of our operations: Comparisons between 2021 and 2020 are described below. A discussion of changes in our results of operations between year ended December 31, 2020 compared to 2019 has been omitted from this Annual Report on Form 10-K and can be found in “\n” of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. The reclassification of Horseshoe Hammond from discontinued operations to continuing operations in the year ended December 31, 2020 did not result in material changes to the comparative analysis provided on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n39\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues were as follows:\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nConsolidated revenues increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily due to recent acquisitions including the Merger on July 20, 2020, the William Hill Acquisition on April 22, 2021, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021, offset by the divestiture of certain properties discussed above. In addition, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2020 were negatively impacted by the COVID-19 public health emergency. All of our casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020. Further, many of our properties were operating under restrictive guidelines through the first half of 2021 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. Local and state regulations and the implementation of social distancing and health and safety protocols in response to COVID-19 resulted in reduced gaming capacity and hotel occupancy as well as limitations on the operation of food and beverage outlets, live entertainment events, and conventions. As of December 31, 2021, all of our properties have resumed certain operations, to the extent permitted, with the exception of Lake Charles which was severely damaged by Hurricane Laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses were as follows:\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nCasino and pari-mutuel expenses consist primarily of salaries and wages associated with our gaming operations, marketing and promotions and gaming taxes. Hotel expenses consist principally of salaries, wages and supplies associated with our hotel operations. Food and beverage expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our food and beverage operations. Other expenses consist principally of salaries and wages and costs of goods sold associated with our retail, entertainment and other operations.\nCasino and pari-mutuel, hotel, food and beverage, and other expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as a result of our recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, the reopening of substantially all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the partial return of our workforce, and advertising costs consisting of television, radio and internet marketing campaigns directly attributable to the launch and rebranding of our Caesars Sportsbook app contributed\n40\nto the increase noted. These increases were partially offset as the Company focused on labor efficiencies and post-merger synergies, as described above. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company managed increases in food costs and effectively improved margins by focusing on efficiencies within food and beverage venues and menu options.\nGeneral and administrative expenses include items such as information technology, facility maintenance, utilities, property and liability insurance, expenses for administrative departments such as accounting, compliance, purchasing, human resources, legal and internal audit, and property taxes. General and administrative expenses also include other marketing expenses not directly related to our gaming and non-gaming operations.\nGeneral and administrative expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased year over year as the result of the reopening of all of our properties to the extent permitted by regulations governing the applicable jurisdiction, the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. These increases were partially offset by a reduced cost structure implemented by the Company while our properties were temporarily closed due to the impact of COVID-19. Additionally, synergies associated with the combined companies from the Merger and the Company’s focus on labor efficiencies and expense savings resulted in reductions to certain administrative costs for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCorporate expenses include unallocated expenses such as payroll, annual bonus plans, stock-based compensation, professional fees, and other various expenses not directly related to the Company’s operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, corporate expenses increased primarily due to the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, payroll costs increased as compared to the prior year period due to performance-based incentives and higher costs in the labor market. These costs have been partially offset by a decline in the corporate headcount.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period, depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily due to the recent acquisitions, including the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition, and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore.\nTransaction costs and other operating costs primarily included expenses related to the William Hill Acquisition for the year ended December 31, 2021 and costs related to the Merger for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nImpairment charges in 2021 relate to the rebranding of certain of our properties. Impairment charges in 2020 relate to the impairment of goodwill and trade names recognized due to a triggering event resulting from COVID-19 and agreements to sell properties whereby the carrying value exceeded the estimated net sales proceeds.\nOther Expense\nOther expense was as follows:\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, interest expense, net increased year over year as a result of the Merger, the William Hill Acquisition and the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. Outstanding debt assumed, additional debt raised, and assumed financing obligations resulted in the increase in interest expense. The increase was partially offset by reduction in interest expense due to the extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes, early extinguishment of the CRC Notes, partial repayment of the CEI Senior Notes and the repricing of CRC Incremental Term Loan.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the loss on extinguishment of debt was related to early repayment premiums, and extinguishment of deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the prepayments of the CRC Notes and CEI Senior Notes, the repricing of the CRC Incremental Term Loan, and the early extinguishment of the 5% Convertible Notes. The loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 was related to the payment of outstanding debt in connection with the Merger.\n41\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, other income (loss) fluctuated year over year mainly due to a loss on the change in fair value of investments and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes.\nThe effective tax rate was 22.3% for 2021, (8.2%) for 2020, and 35.2% for 2019. The effective tax rate in 2020 differed from the statutory rate of 21% primarily due to an increase in valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets due to the series of transactions with VICI during the year. Such transactions did not occur in 2021. Refer to Item 8. - Note 17 for the effective income tax rate reconciliation.\nSegment comparison for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nLas Vegas Segment\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nLas Vegas segment’s net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of the Merger and reopening of all of our Las Vegas properties in accordance with state and local regulations as of December 31, 2021. In June 2021, convention and entertainment venues began to reopen as COVID-19 capacity restrictions were lifted.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, all of our reopened properties in the Las Vegas segment experienced an increase in net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA compared to Former Caesars’ prior year results as all properties were temporarily closed for a portion of 2020. Slot win percentage in Las Vegas during the year ended December 31, 2021 was within our typical range and hotel occupancy trended upward compared to 2020. Additionally, pent up demand positively impacted our results of operations in the Las Vegas segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. These positive trends, however, may not be sustained due to increasing costs and continuing uncertainty relating to COVID-19.\n42\nRegional Segment\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nRegional segment’s net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period as a result of the Merger and consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. The increase was slightly offset by divestitures of certain properties and closures of certain properties due to Hurricane Ida and the Caldor fire. As of December 31, 2021, all of our properties in our Regional segment reopened, with the exception of Lake Charles which closed due to severe damage from Hurricane Laura and will remain closed until the second half of 2022 when construction of a new land-based casino is expected to be completed. Slot win percentage in the Regional segment during the year ended December 31, 2021 was within our typical range. Additionally, pent up demand positively impacted our results of operations in the Regional segment for the year ended December 31, 2021. These positive trends, however, may not be sustained due to increasing costs and continuing uncertainty relating to COVID-19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our Regional segment’s net revenues, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin increased compared to the prior year across all properties, including Former Caesars, due to reductions in workforce and marketing costs, synergies from the purchasing power of the combined Caesars organization, and the Company’s focus on higher margin food and beverage offerings.\nCaesars Digital Segment\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\n43\n(a)\nCaesars Digital generated an additional $706 million of sports betting handle, which is not included in this table for the year ended December 31, 2021, for select wholly-owned and third-party operations for which Caesars Digital provides services and we receive all. or a share of, the net profits. Sports betting handle includes $40 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to horse racing and pari-mutuel wagers.\nCaesars Digital includes Caesars operations for retail and mobile sports betting, online casino, and online poker. It is comprised of the Caesars interactive business acquired in the Merger, operations acquired in the William Hill Acquisition and historical iGaming at Tropicana Atlantic City. Caesars Digital’s sports betting handle, iGaming handle, and net revenues increased significantly for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same prior year period due to the acquisitions and the recent marketing launch of our new sportsbook. However, net revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 were negatively impacted by a sports betting hold percentage that was below our typical range. The low hold percentage was driven in part by increased odds and profit boosts, which are promotional enhancements that improve odds or wager payouts for customers. In addition, our hold percentage was negatively impacted by competitive pricing strategies and lower than typical hold in certain betting markets. iGaming hold percentage for the year ended December 31, 2021 was within our typical range.\nIn connection with the launch of our Caesars branded sportsbook and iGaming applications, we deployed a significant level of marketing spend to build brand awareness and acquire and retain customers. As sports betting and online casinos expand through increased state legalization and customer adoption, growth in marketing and promotional costs in highly competitive markets negatively impacts Caesars Digital Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins in comparison to prior periods.\nManaged and Branded Segment\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nWe manage several properties and license rights to the use of our brands. These revenue agreements typically include reimbursement of certain costs that we incur directly. Such costs are primarily related to payroll costs incurred on behalf of the properties under management. The revenue related to these reimbursable management costs has a direct impact on our evaluation of Adjusted EBITDA margin which, when excluded, reflects margins typically realized from such agreements. The table below presents the amount included in net revenues and total operating expenses related to these reimbursable costs.\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nManaged and Branded segment’s net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA increased as a result of the Merger. Upon the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore, the operations of the property are included in the Regional segment above and management revenue is eliminated upon consolidation. Additionally, in connection with the closing of the sale of Caesars Southern Indiana on September 3, 2021, the Company and the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (“EBCI”) extended their existing relationship by entering into a 10-year brand license agreement, with cancellation rights in exchange for a termination fee at the buyer’s discretion following the fifth anniversary of the agreement, for the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana. Caesars Southern Indiana was previously reported within the Regional segment and subsequent to the sale, as a result of the license agreement relating to the continued use of the Caesars brand and Caesars Rewards loyalty program at Caesars Southern Indiana, is reported within the Managed and Branded\n44\nsegment. All of our managed properties have reopened as of December 31, 2021, however, a subsequent temporary closure of Caesars Windsor occurred from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022 due to COVID - 19.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, net revenues and Adjusted EBITDA for Managed and Branded increased as compared to Former Caesars’ prior period.\nCorporate & Other\n___________________\n*\nNot meaningful.\nSupplemental Unaudited Presentation of Consolidated Adjusted Earnings before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”) for the Years Ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nAdjusted EBITDA (described below), a non-GAAP financial measure, has been presented as a supplemental disclosure because it is a widely used measure of performance and basis for valuation of companies in our industry and we believe that this non-GAAP supplemental information will be helpful in understanding our ongoing operating results. Management has historically used Adjusted EBITDA when evaluating operating performance because we believe that the inclusion or exclusion of certain recurring and non-recurring items is necessary to provide a full understanding of our core operating results and as a means to evaluate period-to-period results. Adjusted EBITDA represents net income (loss) before interest income or interest expense net of interest capitalized, (benefit) provision for income taxes, unrealized (gain) loss on investments and marketable securities, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, impairment charges, transaction expenses, severance expense, selling costs associated with the divestitures of properties, equity in income (loss) of unconsolidated affiliates, (gain) loss on the sale or disposal of property and equipment, (gain) loss related to divestitures, changes in the fair value of certain derivatives and certain non-recurring expenses such as sign-on and retention bonuses, business optimization expenses and transformation expenses, certain litigation awards and settlements, losses on inventory associated with properties temporarily closed as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency, contract exit or termination costs, and certain regulatory settlements. Adjusted EBITDA also excludes the expense associated with certain of our leases as these transactions were accounted for as financing obligations and the associated expense is included in interest expense. Adjusted EBITDA is not a measure of performance or liquidity calculated in accordance with GAAP. Adjusted EBITDA is unaudited and should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful than, net income (loss) as an indicator of our operating performance. Uses of cash flows that are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDA include capital expenditures, interest payments, income taxes, debt principal repayments, payments under our leases with affiliates of GLPI and VICI Properties Inc. and certain regulatory gaming assessments, which can be significant. As a result, Adjusted EBITDA should not be considered as a measure of our liquidity. Other companies that provide EBITDA information may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA may not be the same as the definitions used in any of our debt agreements.\n45\nThe following table summarizes our Adjusted EBITDA for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in addition to reconciling net income (loss) to Adjusted EBITDA in accordance with GAAP (unaudited):\n46\n____________________\n(a)\nOther (income) loss primarily includes changes in fair value of investments, changes in fair value of the derivative liability related to the 5% Convertible Notes, and gains and losses on foreign currency exchange.\n(b)\nTransaction costs and other operating costs primarily represent costs related to the William Hill Acquisition and the Merger, various contract or license termination exit costs, professional services, other acquisition costs and severance costs.\n(c)\nOther items primarily represent certain consulting and legal fees, rent for non-operating assets, relocation expenses, retention bonuses, and business optimization expenses.\n(d)\nRepresents results of operations for Horseshoe Baltimore for periods prior to the consolidation resulting from the Company’s increase in its ownership interest on August 26, 2021. Such figures are based on unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors and do not conform to GAAP.\n(e)\nPre-acquisition William Hill represents results of operations for William Hill prior to the acquisition. Such figures are based on unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors and, for the 2021, 2020 and 2019 periods, do not conform to GAAP.\n(f)\nDivestitures include results of operations for certain properties divested. See Item 7 - Overview above. Such figures are based on unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors and do not conform to GAAP.\n(g)\nSuch presentation does not conform to GAAP or the Securities and Exchange Commission rules for pro forma presentation; however, we believe that the additional financial information will be helpful to investors in comparing current results with results of prior periods. This is non-GAAP data and should not be considered a substitute for data prepared in accordance with GAAP, but should be viewed in addition to the results of operations reported by the Company.\n(h)\nPre-acquisition CEC represents results of operations for Former Caesars prior to the Merger. Such figures are based on unaudited internal financial statements and have not been reviewed by the Company’s auditors and, for the 2020 and 2019 periods, do not conform to GAAP.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe are a holding company and our only significant assets are ownership interests in our subsidiaries. Our ability to fund our obligations depends on existing cash on hand, contracted asset sales, cash flows from our subsidiaries and our ability to raise capital. Our primary sources of liquidity and capital resources are existing cash on hand, cash flows from operations, availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facilities, proceeds from the issuance of debt and equity securities and proceeds from completed asset sales. Our cash requirements may fluctuate significantly depending on our decisions with respect to business acquisitions or divestitures and strategic capital and marketing investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our cash on hand and revolving borrowing capacity were as follows:\n___________________\n(a)\nRevolver capacity includes $995 million under our CEI Revolving Credit Facility, as amended, maturing in July 2025, $1,025 million under our CRC Revolving Credit Facility, maturing in December 2022 and $10 million under our Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility, maturing in July 2022.\n47\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, our operating activities generated operating cash inflows of $1.2 billion, as compared to operating cash outflows of $561 million during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the results of operations described above in addition to the Merger, William Hill Acquisition and consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore. In addition, we continue to improve our financial position and reduce our operating costs related to our debt through accelerated repayments, amendments to existing debt agreements and obtaining favorable rates on new borrowings which has resulted in, and is expected to continue to provide, interest expense savings.\nOn September 21, 2021, CRC entered into a second amendment related to the CRC Incremental Term Loan to reduce the interest rate margins to 3.50% per annum in the case of any London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) loan or 2.50% per annum in the case of any base rate loan. The CRC Incremental Term Loan is a LIBOR based loan of which the amendment lowers our annual interest cost by reducing the applicable margin by 100 basis points from 4.50% to 3.50%.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased or redeemed all $1.7 billion 5.25% senior notes due 2025 (the “CRC Notes”) and recognized a $199 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company purchased a total of $100 million in principal amount of the $1.8 billion 8.125% Senior Notes due 2027 (the “CEI Senior Notes”) and the Company recognized a $14 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt.\nOn September 24, 2021, the Company issued $1.2 billion in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% Senior Notes due 2029 (the “Senior Notes”) pursuant to an indenture dated as of September 24, 2021 between the Company and U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee. The Senior Notes will mature on October 15, 2029 with interest payable on April 15 and October 15 of each year, commencing April 15, 2022. Proceeds from the issuance of the Senior Notes, as well as cash on hand, was used to repay the CRC Notes, as described above.\nAs a result of our increased ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore, we began to consolidate the aggregate principal amount of Horseshoe Baltimore’s senior secured term loan facility (the “Baltimore Term Loan”) and amounts outstanding, if any, under Horseshoe Baltimore’s senior secured revolving credit facility (the “Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility”). The Baltimore Term Loan matures in 2024 and is subject to a variable rate of interest calculated as LIBOR plus 4.00%. The Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility has borrowing capacity of up to $10 million available, matures in 2022, and is subject to a variable rate of interest calculated as LIBOR plus 6.00%. As of December 31, 2021, there was $10 million of available borrowing capacity under the Baltimore Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which the Company would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for\n£2.9 billion\n, or approximately\n$3.9 billion\n.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the “Bridge Facility Borrower”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day £1.0 billion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day £116 million revolving credit facility (collectively, the “Debt Financing”). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The £1.5 billion Interim Facilities Agreement (the “Interim Facilities Agreement”) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, we repaid the £503 million cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full £116 million from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of £700 million. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill International. Certain investments acquired have been excluded from the held for sale asset group. On September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately £2.2 billion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, the Company expects to receive approximately £835 million, or $1.2 billion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. In order to\nmanage the risk of changes in the GBP denominated sales price and expected proceeds, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts.\nThe sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\n48\nWe expect that our primary capital requirements going forward will relate to the expansion and maintenance of our properties, taxes, servicing our outstanding indebtedness, and rent payments under our GLPI Master Lease, the VICI Leases and other leases. We make capital expenditures and perform continuing refurbishment and maintenance at our properties to maintain our quality standards. Our capital expenditure requirements for\n2022\nare expected to increase compared to prior periods as a result of increased expansion projects, the rebranding of certain properties, implementation and migration of states to our Liberty platform and continued investment into new markets with our Caesars Sportsbook and iGaming applications in our Caesars Digital segment. In addition, we may, from time to time, seek to repurchase our outstanding indebtedness. Any such purchases may be funded by existing cash balances or the incurrence of debt. The amount and timing of any repurchase will be based on business and market conditions, capital availability, compliance with debt covenants and other considerations.\nIn 2020, we funded $400 million to escrow as of the closing of the Merger and have begun to utilize those funds in accordance with a three year capital expenditure plan in the state of New Jersey.

These commitments and contingencies are discussed in greater detail in “\nPart I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings\n” and Note 11 to our Financial Statements, both of which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. In addition, new competition among retail and online operations may have a material adverse effect on our revenues and could have a similar adverse effect on our liquidity. See “\nPart I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Risks Related to Our Business\n” which is included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our financial statements in conformity with GAAP. In preparing our financial statements, we have made our best estimates and judgments of the amounts and disclosures included in the financial statements, giving regard to materiality. When more than one accounting principle, or method of its application, is generally accepted, we select the principle or method that we consider to be the most appropriate under specific circumstances. Application of these accounting principles requires us to make estimates about the future resolution of existing uncertainties. Certain of our accounting policies, including those in connection with business combinations, certain fair value measurements, income taxes, long-lived assets, goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets, allowance for doubtful accounts related to certain gaming receivables, self-insurance reserves, and litigation, claims and assessments require that we apply significant judgment in defining the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates.\nWe consider accounting estimates to be critical accounting policies when:\n•\nthe estimates involve matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate is made; and\n•\ndifferent estimates or changes to estimates could have a material impact on the reported financial position, changes in financial position, or results of operations.\nBy their nature, these judgments and estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. Our judgments and estimates are based on our historical experience, terms of existing contracts, observance of trends in the industry, information gathered from customer behavior, and information available from other outside sources, as appropriate. Due to the inherent uncertainty involving judgments and estimates, actual results may differ from those estimates.\nOur most critical accounting estimates and assumptions are in the following areas:\nBusiness Combinations\nWe applied the provisions of Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) Topic 805, “Business Combinations,” in the accounting for our acquisitions of Former Caesars, William Hill PLC, and our additional interest in Horseshoe Baltimore. It required us to recognize the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values, which were determined using market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Goodwill as of the respective acquisition dates was measured as the excess of consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Goodwill is generally the result of expected synergies of the combined company or an assembled workforce.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks, Caesars Rewards acquired in the Merger, customer relationships and gaming rights. The fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach.\nAcquired trademarks, developed technology and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks, technology, or loyalty program, we would have to make a stream of\n54\npayments to a third party in return for the right to use their name, technology, or program. By virtue of this asset, we avoid any such payments and record the related intangible value of the Company’s ownership of the brand name, technology, or program.\nCustomer relationships were valued using the cost approach and the incremental cash flow method under the income approach. The incremental cash flow method compares the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced.\nGaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life. The fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology, based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value.\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the acquisition date. Assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date, or an income approach.\nThe fair value of the financing obligations were calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period.\nReacquired rights were valued using the excess earnings method that reflects the present value of the future profit William Hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The forecasted profit used within the valuation was adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship as a component of the purchase consideration.\nFair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach. The market data is then adjusted for any significant differences, to the extent known, between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued. The value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach. Other personal property assets such as furniture, gaming and computer equipment, fixtures, computer software, and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset. The cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and/or economic obsolescence.\nAssets and liabilities which are designated as held for sale on an acquisition date are also measured at fair value, utilizing similar market, income and cost approaches described above, based on the underlying asset class held for sale.\nCash flow estimates are significant to many valuations described above and may include forecasts with assumptions regarding factors such as recent and budgeted operating performance, future growth rates, and the determination of appropriate discount rates to estimate fair value. These inputs involve significant assumptions including the future effects of COVID-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from a business combination, which may not be realized as projected. Certain assumptions, such as the effects of COVID-19, may be beyond our control.\nFair Value Measurements\nWe use interest rate swaps, which are derivative instruments classified as hedging transactions, to limit our exposure to interest rate risk. Derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements at fair value. The estimated fair values of our derivative instruments are based on market prices obtained from dealer quotes. Such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay to terminate the contracts. Our derivative instruments contain a credit risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements. We minimize that risk by evaluating the creditworthiness of our counterparties, which are limited to major banks and financial institutions. The fair values of our derivative instruments are adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty, if the derivative is an asset, or adjusted for the credit rating of the Company, if the derivative is a liability.\nSee Note 8 for more details regarding fair value measurements and Item 7A for quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.\n55\nIncome Taxes\nWe and our subsidiaries file income tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. Our income tax returns are subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and other tax authorities. Positions taken in tax returns are sometimes subject to uncertainty in the tax laws and may not ultimately be accepted by the IRS or other tax authorities. See Note 17 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the status and impact of examinations by tax authorities.\nWe record income taxes under the asset and liability method, whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases, and as attributable to operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. We reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if, based on the available evidence, it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed periodically based on the “more likely than not” realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency, and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, our experience with operating loss and tax credit carryforwards not expiring unused, and tax planning alternatives.\nWhen there is a recent history of operating losses and negative normalized earnings and a return to operating profitability has not yet been demonstrated, we cannot rely on projections of future taxable earnings for purposes of assessing recoverability of our deferred tax assets. In such cases, we use systematic and logical methods to estimate when deferred tax liabilities will reverse and generate taxable income and when deferred tax assets will reverse and generate tax deductions. Our most significant deferred tax asset relates to the failed sale-leaseback obligation with VICI and GLPI (see Note 10). The reversal of this deferred tax asset requires judgment and estimates and has a material impact on the determination of the amount of valuation allowance required.\nUnder the applicable accounting standards, we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more-likely-than-not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. The accounting standards also provide guidance on de-recognition, classification, interest and penalties on income taxes, accounting in interim periods and disclosure requirements for uncertain tax positions.\nLong-Lived Assets\nWe have significant capital invested in our long-lived assets, and judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets, salvage values to be assigned to assets, and if or when an asset has been impaired. The accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation and amortization expense recognized in our financial results and whether we have a gain or loss on the disposal of an asset. We assign lives to our assets based on our standard policy, which is established by management as representative of the useful life of each category of asset. We review the carrying value of our long-lived assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition. The factors considered by management in performing this assessment include current operating results, trends and prospects, planned construction and renovation projects, as well as the effect of obsolescence, demand, competition, and other economic, legal, and regulatory factors. In estimating expected future cash flows for determining whether an asset is impaired, assets are grouped at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which, for most of our assets, is the individual property. See Note 6 for additional information.\nGoodwill and Other Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nAssessing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment is a process that requires significant judgment and involves detailed qualitative and quantitative business-specific analysis and many individual assumptions which fluctuate between assessments.\nWe determine the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of EBITDA, valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. We also evaluate the aggregate fair value of all of our reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to our aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in our industry.\nWe determine the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets using either the relief from royalty method or the excess earnings method under the income approach or replacement cost market approach. The determination of fair value of our\n56\nreporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets requires management to make significant assumptions and estimates around the forecasts as well as the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples. Changes in these estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of our reporting units, intangible assets and result in potential impairment.\nForecasts and the determination of appropriate discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets involves significant assumptions and estimates. Assumptions include those used to assess future effects of COVID-19 as well as the realization of synergies anticipated from acquisitions which may not be realized at the projected rate.\nWe acquired William Hill PLC on April 22, 2021 and allocated the total purchase consideration transferred to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values and therefore, the fair value of the acquired reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets do not significantly exceed their respective carrying values. As of October 1, 2021, one other reporting unit in the Regional Segment with goodwill totaling $420 million had a fair value that did not significantly exceed its respective carrying values. To the extent gaming volumes deteriorate in the near future, discount rates increase significantly, or we do not meet our projected performance, we may recognize further impairments, and such impairments could be material. In addition, $352 million of goodwill within our Regional segment is associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying value. See Note 7 for additional information.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts - Gaming\nWe reserve an estimated amount for gaming receivables that may not be collected to reduce the Company’s receivables to their net carrying amount. Methodologies for estimating the allowance for doubtful accounts range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. As with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for allowance for doubtful accounts. As of December 31, 2021, a 5% increase or decrease to the allowance determined based on a percentage of aged receivables would change the reserve by approximately $14 million.\nSelf-Insurance Reserves\nWe are self-insured for various levels of general liability, employee medical insurance coverage and workers’ compensation coverage. Insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims, as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported. We utilize independent consultants to assist management in its determination of estimated insurance liabilities. While the total cost of claims incurred depends on future developments, in managements’ opinion, recorded reserves are adequate to cover future claims payments. Self-insurance reserves for employee medical claims, workers’ compensations and general liability claims are included self-insurance claims and reserves within Accrued other liabilities on the Balance Sheets. See Note 9.\nThe assumptions, including those related to the COVID-19 public health emergency, utilized by our actuaries are subject to significant uncertainty and if outcomes differ from these assumptions or events develop or progress in a negative manner, the Company could experience a material adverse effect and additional liabilities may be recorded in the future.\nLitigation, Claims and Assessments\nWe utilize estimates for litigation, claims and assessments. These estimates are based on our knowledge and experience regarding current and past events, as well as assumptions about future events. If our assessment of such a matter should change, we may have to change the estimates, which may have an adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows. Actual results could differ from these estimates.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information with respect to recent accounting pronouncements and the impact of these pronouncements on our Financial Statements, see Note 2,\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\n–\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\n, in the Notes."

    "text": "Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. We are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from variable rate long-term debt arrangements. Our exposure to foreign exchange risk is attributable to funds held in operating and escrow accounts, as well as the previously announced sales price of William Hill International, which are denominated in British Pounds (GBP).\n57\nInterest Rate Risk\nAs of December 31, 2021, the face value of our long-term debt was $14.3 billion, including variable-rate long-term borrowings of $6.6 billion. No amounts were outstanding under our revolving credit facilities.\nAs a result of the Merger, we assumed Former Caesars’ interest rate swaps, of which four interest rate swap agreements are currently in place to fix the interest rate on $1.3 billion of variable rate debt. As a result, net of these interest rate swaps, $5.3 billion of debt remains subject to variable interest rates, as of December 31, 2021, for the term of the agreements. See Note 12 for additional information. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as settlements occur. Changes in the variable interest rates to be received pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on future cash flows.\nWe do not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\nThe table below provides information as of December 31, 2021 about our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates including the cash flows associated with amortization, the notional amounts of interest rate derivative instruments, and related weighted average interest rates. Principal amounts are used to calculate the payments to be exchanged under the related agreements and weighted average variable rates are based on implied forward rates in the yield curve as of December 31, 2021 and should not be considered a predictor of actual future interest rates.\n____________________\n(a)\nThese amounts represent the interest rate swap notional amounts that mature at the end of 2022. See Note 12 for additional information.\nAs of December 31, 2021, borrowings outstanding under our credit facilities were variable-rate borrowings. Assuming a 100 basis-point increase in LIBOR, our annual interest cost would change by $53 million based on gross amounts outstanding at December 31, 2021.\nLIBOR is expected to be discontinued by lending institutions after December 31, 2021 for new debt agreements and after June 30, 2023 no additional LIBOR rates will be available. We have variable rate debt instruments which are subject to LIBOR interest rates plus a margin or base rate. Our CRC Credit Facility contains alternative rates in the event that LIBOR is no longer available. The Baltimore Term Loan has been amended and we intend to work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from LIBOR will have minimal impact on our financial condition, but can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR. Our interest rate swaps mature on December 31, 2022.\nForeign Exchange Rate Risks\nT\nhe Company has entered into several foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates between USD and GBP and to fix the exchange rate for a portion of the funds used in the William Hill Acquisition, repayment of related debt, and expected proceeds of the sale of the international operations. The Company entered into a foreign exchange forward contract to purchase £724 million at a contracted exchange rate, which was settled on June 11, 2021 and December 31, 2021\n. As of December 31, 2021, the Company is contracted\nto sell a total of £790 million at fixed exchange rates. These contracts are to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate related to a portion of the expected proceeds from the sale of William Hill International. The forward term of these contracts ends in March 2022.\n58"

    "text": "INDEX TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\n59\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity, and cash flow for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flow for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 23, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nAcquisition of William Hill PLC – Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which the Company would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for £2.9 billion, or approximately $3.9 billion.\nThe Company previously held equity interests in William Hill PLC and William Hill U.S. Holdco Inc. (a William Hill PLC subsidiary). Accordingly, the acquisition is accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages, or a “step acquisition”. The estimated purchase consideration allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values. The Company used market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination in the determining the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. These approaches required management to make significant assumptions and estimates around expected cash flows and projected financial results related to online sports betting and iGaming in the United States (US) (collectively, the “forecasts”) as well as the selection of a discount rate. Changes in these assumptions and estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of the intangible assets and assigned goodwill. Therefore, auditing the forecasts and\n60\nthe selection of discount rates involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity as well as an increased level of audit effort, including the involvement of valuation specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecasts and the selection of the discount rate selected by management to determine the fair value of the intangible assets and assigned goodwill included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the forecasts and the selection of discount rates.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\n•\nWe evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in the forecasts by: 1) comparing the forecasts to information included in the Company’s communications to the Board of Directors, gaming industry reports, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies; 2) comparing management’s assumptions regarding the dates for legalization of online sports betting and iGaming and the estimated market size for certain states in the US to gaming industry reports; 3) comparing forecasted market share with the Company’s historical market share; and 4) conducting inquiries with management.\n•\nWith the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount rates selected by management, including assessing the impact of the uncertainty in the forecasts, testing the market-based source information underlying the selection of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates selected by management.\nGoodwill\n–\nRefer to Note 7 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. The Company also evaluates the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date.\nThe Company performed its annual goodwill impairment assessment as of October 1, 2021 and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit was in excess of its carrying value. The Company’s goodwill balance was $11,076 million as of December 31, 2021, of which $1,016 million was related to two reporting units within the Regional segment which had estimated fair values that did not significantly exceed their respective carrying values.\nThe EBITDA forecasts and the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples used to determine the fair value of the reporting units involved significant assumptions and estimates. Therefore, our audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s EBITDA forecasts required a higher degree of auditor judgment as well as an increased level of audit effort and the need to use more experienced audit professionals. In addition, the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity as well as an increased level of audit effort, including the involvement of valuation specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to management’s financial projections for these two reporting units within the segment, included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of the Company’s internal controls over the forecasts and the selection of discount rates and valuation multiples.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast EBITDA by comparing actual results to management’s historical forecasts.\n61\n•\nWe evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in management’s forecasts by: 1) comparing the forecasts to information included in the Company’s communications to the Board of Directors, gaming industry reports, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies; 2) conducting inquiries with property management; and 3) evaluating management’s estimate of the impact of the expansion of gaming activities by analyzing historical information.\n•\nWith the assistance of our valuation specialists, we evaluated the discount rates and valuation multiples selected by management, including assessing the impact of the uncertainty in the forecasts on the discount rates and valuation multiples, testing the market-based source information underlying the selection of both the discount rates and valuation multiples and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate and valuation multiple calculations, and developing a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rates and valuation multiples selected by management.\n/s/\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nFebruary 23, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\n62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nThe Board of Directors and Stockholders\nCaesars Entertainment, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019 of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.,\n(formerly Eldorado Resorts Inc.)\n(the Company), and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (a)(ii) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects the results of the Company’s operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB.

Beginning in 2005, grew through a series of acquisitions, including the acquisition of MTR Gaming Group, Inc. in 2014, Isle of Capri Casinos, Inc. (“Isle” or “Isle of Capri”) in 2017 and Tropicana Entertainment, Inc. in 2018. On July 20, 2020, the Company completed the merger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation (“Former Caesars”) pursuant to which Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company (the “Merger”) and the Company changed the Company’s ticker symbol on the NASDAQ Stock Market from “ERI” to “CZR”.\nOn April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for\n£\n2.9\nbillion, or approximately $\n3.9\nbillion\n(the “William Hill Acquisition”). See below for further discussion of the William Hill Acquisition.\nThe Company owns, leases, brands or manages an aggregate of\n52\ndomestic properties in\n16\nstates with approximately\n55,700\nslot machines, video lottery terminals and e-tables, approximately\n2,900\ntable games and approximately\n47,700\nhotel rooms as of December 31, 2021. The Company operates and conducts sports wagering across\n21\nstates and domestic jurisdictions,\n14\nof which are mobile for sports betting, and operates regulated online real money gaming businesses in\nfive\nstates. In addition, we have other domestic and international properties that are authorized to use the brands and marks of Caesars Entertainment, Inc., as well as other non-gaming properties. The Company’s primary source of revenue is generated by our casino properties’ gaming operations, retail and online sports betting, as well as online gaming, and the Company utilizes its hotels, restaurants, bars, entertainment, racing, retail shops and other services to attract customers to its properties.\nThe Company’s operations for retail and mobile sports betting, online casino, and online poker are included under the Caesars Digital segment. The Company has made significant investments into the interactive business with the completion of the Merger and the William Hill Acquisition. The Company has launched a significant marketing campaign with distinguished actors, athletes and media personalities promoting the launch of the Caesars Sportsbook app. The app offers numerous pre-match and live markets, extensive odds and flexible limits, player props, and same-game parlays. Caesars Sportsbook has partnerships with the NFL, NBA, NHL and MLB while being the exclusive odds provider for ESPN and CBS Sports. The Company also expects to continue to create new partnerships among collegiate and professional sports teams and recently entered into the exclusive naming-rights partnership that rebranded the Caesars Superdome. The Company expects to continue to expand its operations in the Caesars Digital segment as new jurisdictions legalize retail and online sports betting.\nThe Company has divested certain properties and other assets, including non-core properties and divestitures required by regulatory agencies. See Note 4 for a discussion of properties recently sold or currently held for sale and Note 19 for segment information.\nWilliam Hill Acquisition\nOn September 30, 2020, the Company announced that it had reached an agreement with William Hill PLC on the terms of a recommended cash acquisition pursuant to which the Company would acquire the entire issued and to be issued share capital (other than shares owned by the Company or held in treasury) of William Hill PLC, in an all-cash transaction. On April 22, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC for\n£\n2.9\nbillion, or approximately $\n3.9\nbillion\n. See Note 3.\nIn connection with the William Hill Acquisition, on April 22, 2021, a newly formed subsidiary of the Company (the “Bridge Facility Borrower”) entered into a Credit Agreement (the “Bridge Credit Agreement”) with certain lenders party thereto and Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch, as administrative agent and collateral agent, pursuant to which the lenders party thereto provided the Debt Financing (as defined below). The Bridge Credit Agreement provides for (a) a 540-day £\n1.0\nbillion asset sale bridge facility, (b) a 60-day £\n503\nmillion cash confirmation bridge facility and (c) a 540-day £\n116\nmillion revolving credit\n70\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nfacility (collectively, the “Debt Financing”). The proceeds of the bridge loan facilities provided under the Bridge Credit Agreement were used (i) to pay a portion of the cash consideration for the acquisition and (ii) to pay fees and expenses related to the acquisition and related transactions. The proceeds of the revolving credit facility under the Bridge Credit Agreement may be used for working capital and general corporate purposes. The £\n1.5\nbillion Interim Facilities Agreement (the “Interim Facilities Agreement”) entered into on October 6, 2020 with Deutsche Bank AG, London Branch and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., and amended on December 11, 2020, was terminated upon the execution of the Bridge Credit Agreement. On May 12, 2021, we repaid the £\n503\nmillion cash confirmation bridge facility. On June 14, 2021, the Company drew down the full £\n116\nmillion from the revolving credit facility and the proceeds, in addition to excess Company cash, were used to make a partial repayment of the asset sale bridge facility in the amount of £\n700\nmillion. Outstanding borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill’s non-U.S. operations including the UK and international online divisions and the retail betting shops (collectively, “William Hill International”), all of which are held for sale as of the date of the closing of the William Hill Acquisition and reflected within discontinued operations. See Note 4. Certain investments acquired have been excluded from the held for sale asset group. See Note 8 for investments in which the Company elected to apply the fair value option.\nOn September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately £\n2.2\nbillion. After repayment of the outstanding debt under the Bridge Credit Agreement, described above, the Company expects to receive approximately £\n835\nmillion, or $\n1.2\nbillion, subject to any permitted leakage, which is customary for sale transactions in the UK. In order to\nmanage the risk of changes in the GBP denominated sales price and expected proceeds, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts. See\nNote 8. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders of 888 Holdings Plc and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\nOn August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in CBAC Borrower, LLC (“Horseshoe Baltimore”), a property which it also manages, to approximately\n75.8\n%. Caesars was subsequently determined to have a controlling financial interest in Horseshoe Baltimore and we began to consolidate the results of operations of the property following our change in ownership. See Note 3. Our previously held investment was remeasured as of the date of the change in ownership and the Company recognized a gain of $\n40\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021. Management fees received prior to the consolidation event have been presented within the Managed and Branded segment. Following the increase in ownership, the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore are presented within the Regional segment.\nBasis of Presentation\nOur Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”), which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. Management believes the accounting estimates are appropriate and reasonably determined. Actual amounts could differ from those estimates.\nThe William Hill Acquisition and rebranding of our interactive business (formerly, Caesars Interactive Entertainment “CIE” and now, inclusive of William Hill US, “Caesars Digital”) expanded our access to conduct sports wagering and iGaming operations. As a result, the Company has made a change to the composition of its reportable segments. The Las Vegas and Regional segments are substantially unchanged, while the former Managed, International and CIE reportable segment has been recast for all periods presented into two segments: Caesars Digital and Managed and Branded. As a result of the sale of Caesars Entertainment UK, including the interest in Emerald Resort & Casino (together, “Caesars UK Group”) and the announced sale of William Hill International, international operations of our non-managed properties are classified as discontinued operations. See Note 19 for a listing of properties included in each segment and the determination of our segments.\nThe presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company’s acquisitions of Former Caesars on July 20, 2020, William Hill on April 22, 2021 and the acquisition of an additional interest in Horseshoe Baltimore on August 26, 2021 is not fully comparable to the periods prior to the respective acquisitions. In addition, the presentation of financial information herein for the periods after the Company’s sales of various properties is not fully comparable to the periods prior to their respective sale dates. See Note 3 for further discussion of the acquisitions and related transactions and Note 4 for properties recently sold or currently held for sale.\nConsolidation of Subsidiaries and Variable Interest Entities\nOur Financial Statements include the accounts of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries after elimination of all intercompany accounts and transactions.\n71\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nWe consolidate all subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) for which we or one of our consolidated subsidiaries is the primary beneficiary. Control generally equates to ownership percentage, whereby (i) affiliates that are more than 50% owned are consolidated; (ii) investments in affiliates of 50% or less but greater than 20% are generally accounted for using the equity method where we have determined that we have significant influence over the entities; and (iii) investments in affiliates of 20% or less are generally accounted for as investments in equity securities.\nWe consider ourselves the primary beneficiary of a VIE when we have both the power to direct the activities that most significantly affect the results of the VIE and the right to receive benefits or the obligation to absorb losses of the entity that could be potentially significant to the VIE. We review our investments for VIE consideration if a reconsideration event occurs to determine if the investment continues to qualify as a VIE. If we determine an investment no longer qualifies as a VIE, there may be a material effect to our financial statements.\nConsolidation of Korea Joint Venture\nThe Company was a member in a joint venture to acquire, develop, own, and operate a casino resort project in Incheon, South Korea (the “Korea JV”). We previously determined that the Korea JV was a VIE and the Company was the primary beneficiary, and therefore, we previously consolidated the Korea JV into our financial statements. As of December 31, 2020, the assets and liabilities of the Korea JV were classified as held for sale and consisted of $\n130\nmillion of Property and equipment and Other assets and $\n130\nmillion of current and other long-term liabilities. We sold our interest in the Korea JV on January 21, 2021 and derecognized its assets and liabilities from our Balance Sheets. There was\nno\ngain or loss associated with the sale.\nDevelopments Related to COVID-19\nIn January 2020, an outbreak of a new strain of coronavirus (“COVID-19”) was identified and spread throughout much of the world, including the U.S. All of the Company’s casino properties were temporarily closed for the period from mid-March 2020 through mid-May 2020 due to orders issued by various government agencies and tribal bodies as part of certain precautionary measures intended to help slow the spread of COVID-19. During the year ended December 31, 2021, most of our properties experienced positive trends as restrictions on maximum capacities and amenities available were eased.\nFollowing temporary furloughs and salary reductions during 2020, the Company has emphasized a focus on labor efficiencies as operations resumed. As properties began to reopen during the year ended December 31, 2020, certain capacity restrictions, mask mandates, sanitation guidelines, and the federal COVID-19 vaccine and testing emergency temporary standard were adhered to as required by governmental or tribal orders, directives, and guidelines.\nThe Company experienced positive operating trends in 2021, with a continued focus on operational efficiencies. Although the Company has experienced a decline in net income, Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margins for the year ended December 31, 2021 exceeded pre-pandemic levels experienced in 2019 within our Las Vegas and Regional segments. However, certain revenue streams, such as convention and entertainment revenues, continued to be negatively impacted due to capacity restrictions in the first half of 2021. Future effects of COVID-19 from further outbreaks, including new variants, mask mandates or other restrictions are uncertain and could result in additional closures such as the temporary closure of Caesars Windsor from January 5, 2022 through January 31, 2022. Extensive closure periods impacting many of our properties would have a material adverse effect on future results of operations.\nNote 2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nAdditional significant accounting policy disclosures are provided within the applicable notes to the Financial Statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash equivalents include investments in money market funds that can be redeemed immediately at the current net asset value per share. A money market fund is a mutual fund whose investments are primarily in short-term debt securities designed to maximize current income with liquidity and capital preservation, usually maintaining per share net asset value at a constant amount, such as one dollar. Cash and cash equivalents also include cash maintained for gaming operations. The carrying amounts approximate the fair value because of the short maturity of those instruments (Level 1).\nRestricted Cash and Investments\nRestricted cash includes certificates of deposit and cash restricted under certain operating agreements or restricted for future capital expenditures in the normal course of business.\nInvestments consist primarily of debt and equity securities, held by the Company’s captive insurance subsidiaries, which are regularly purchased with the intention to resell in the short term. Restricted investments included shares acquired in conjunction\n72\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nwith the Company’s sports betting agreements with William Hill that contained restrictions related to the ability to liquidate shares within a specified timeframe. As a result of the William Hill Acquisition, no restricted investments are held as of December 31, 2021. Trading securities are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in current period income (See Note 8).\nAdvertising\nAdvertising costs are expensed in the period the advertising initially takes place.\nAdvertising costs were $\n518\nmillion, $\n64\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and are included within operating expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company launched television, radio and internet marketing campaigns promoting the Caesars Sportsbook. Advertising costs related to the Caesars Digital segment are primarily recorded in Casino and pari-mutuel commissions expense.\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications of prior year presentations have been made to conform to the current period presentation. In June 2021, the Indiana Gaming Commission amended its order that previously required the Company to sell a third casino asset in the state. As a result, Horseshoe Hammond no longer meets the held for sale criteria. The assets and liabilities held for sale have been reclassified as held and used for all periods presented measured at the lower of the carrying amount, adjusted for depreciation and amortization that would have been recognized had the assets been continuously classified as held and used, and the fair value at the date of the amended ruling. Additionally, amounts previously presented in discontinued operations have been reclassified into continuing operations for all relevant periods presented.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nPronouncements Implemented in 2021\nEffective January 1, 2021, we adopted Accounting Standards Updates (“ASU”) 2018-14, Compensation – Retirement Benefits – Defined Benefit Plans – General and ASU 2020-06, Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging, which did not have a material effect on our Financial Statements.\nPronouncements to Be Implemented in Future Periods\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 (amended through January 2021), Reference Rate Reform. The amendments in this update are intended to provide relief to the companies that have contracts, hedging relationships or other transactions that reference the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate which is expected to be discontinued because of reference rate reform on a prospective basis. The amendments provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions if certain criteria are met. The adoption of, and future elections under, ASU 2020-04 are not expected to have a material impact on our Financial Statements as the standard will ease, if warranted, the requirements for accounting for the future effects of the rate reform. The amendments in this update are effective as of March 12, 2020 and companies may elect to apply the amendments prospectively through December 31, 2022. We have not yet adopted this new guidance as of December 31, 2021.\nLIBOR is expected to be discontinued by lending institutions after December 31, 2021 for new debt agreements and after June 30, 2023 no additional LIBOR rates will be available. We have variable rate debt instruments which are subject to LIBOR interest rates plus a margin or base rate. Our CRC Credit Facility contains alternative rates in the event that LIBOR is no longer available. The Baltimore Term Loan has been amended and we intend to work with our lenders to ensure any transition away from LIBOR will have minimal impact on our financial condition, but can provide no assurances regarding the impact of the discontinuation of LIBOR. Our interest rate swaps mature on December 31, 2022.\nNote 3.\nAcquisitions, Purchase Price Accounting and Pro forma Information\nAcquisition of William Hill\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the previously announced acquisition of William Hill PLC for cash consideration of approximately\n£\n2.9\nbillion\n, or approximately\n$\n3.9\nbillion\n, based on the GBP to USD exchange rate on the closing date. Restricted cash which was held in escrow as of December 31, 2020 was used to complete the acquisition.\nPrior to the acquisition, William Hill PLC’s U.S. subsidiary, William Hill U.S. Holdco, Inc. (“William Hill US” and together with William Hill PLC, “William Hill”) operated\n37\nsportsbooks at our properties in\neight\nstates. Subsequent to the William Hill Acquisition, we conducted sports wagering in\n21\nstates and domestic jurisdictions across the U.S. as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we operated regulated online real money gaming businesses in\nfive\nstates as of December 31, 2021 and we\n73\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\ncontinue to leverage the World Series of Poker (“WSOP”) brand, and license the WSOP trademarks for a variety of products and services. Extensive usage of digital platforms, continued legalization in additional states, and growing bettor demand are driving the market for online sports betting platforms in the U.S. and the William Hill Acquisition positioned us to address this growing market. On September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International to 888 Holdings Plc for approximately £\n2.2\nbillion. The sale is subject to satisfaction of customary conditions, including receipt of the approval of shareholders and regulatory approvals, and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nThe Company previously held an equity interest in William Hill PLC and William Hill US (see Note 5). Accordingly, the acquisition is accounted for as a business combination achieved in stages, or a “step acquisition.”\nThe estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation\nThe purchase price allocation for William Hill is preliminary as it relates to determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, including goodwill, and is subject to change. The fair values are based on management’s analysis including preliminary work performed by third-party valuation specialists, which are subject to finalization over the one-year measurement period.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of William Hill, with the excess recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2021:\n____________________\n(a)\nIntangible assets consist of gaming rights valued at $\n80\nmillion, trademarks valued at $\n27\nmillion, developed technology valued at $\n110\nmillion, reacquired rights valued at $\n280\nmillion and customer relationships valued at $\n68\nmillion.\n(b)\nIncludes debt of $\n1.1\nbillion related to William Hill International at the acquisition date.\nThe preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to a measurement period and has since been revised. Assets and liabilities held for sale noted above are substantially all related to William Hill International and during the fourth quarter ended December 31, 2021, management has revised the estimated fair value of the William Hill International operations which has resulted in changes in net assets and the allocation of goodwill. The net impact of these changes was an increase of $\n4\nmillion to other current assets, a $\n38\nmillion decrease to assets held for sale, a $\n46\nmillion increase to goodwill, a $\n10\nmillion increase to other noncurrent assets, a $\n7\nmillion decrease to other current liabilities, a $\n12\nmillion increase to liabilities related to assets held for sale, and a $\n17\nmillion increase to deferred income taxes. The effect of these revisions during the quarter did not have an impact on our Statements of Operations.\n74\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets acquired in the William Hill acquisition make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets.\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the William Hill acquisition date. Assets and liabilities held for sale substantially represent William Hill International which has been initially valued using a combination of approaches including a market approach based on valuation multiples and EBITDA, the relief from royalty method and the replacement cost method. In addition to the approaches described, our estimates have been updated to reflect the sale price of William Hill International in the proposed sale to 888 Holdings Plc, described above.\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included certain investments in common stock. Investments with a publicly available share price were valued using the share price on the acquisition date. Investments without publicly available share data were valued at their carrying value, which approximated fair value.\nOther personal property assets such as furniture, equipment, computer hardware, and fixtures were valued using a cost approach which determined that the carrying values represented fair value of those items at the William Hill acquisition date.\nTrademarks and developed technology were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or technology, the Company would have to make a series of payments to the assets’ owner in return for the right to use their brand or technology. By virtue of their ownership of the respective intangible assets, the Company avoids any such payments and records the related intangible value. The estimated useful lives of the trademarks and developed technology are approximately\n15\nyears and\nsix years\n, respectively, from the acquisition date.\nOnline user relationships are valued using a cost approach based on the estimated marketing and promotional cost to acquire the new active user base if the user relationships were not already in place and needed to be replaced. We estimate the useful life of the user relationships to be approximately\nthree years\nfrom the acquisition date.\nOperating agreements with non-Caesars entities allowed William Hill to operate retail and online sportsbooks as well as online gaming within certain states. These agreements are valued using the excess earnings method, estimating the projected profits of the business attributable to the rights afforded through the agreements, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. We estimate the useful life of these operating agreements to be approximately\n20\nyears from the acquisition date and have included them within amortizing gaming rights.\nThe reacquired rights intangible asset represents the estimated fair value of the Company’s share of the William Hill’s forecasted profits arising from the prior contractual arrangement with the Company to operate retail and online sportsbooks and online gaming. This fair value estimate was determined using the excess earnings method, an income-based approach that reflects the present value of the future profit William Hill expected to earn over the remaining term of the contract, adjusted for returns of other assets that contribute to the generation of this profit, such as working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The forecasted profit used within this valuation is adjusted for the settlement of the preexisting relationship noted previously in the calculation of the purchase consideration in order to avoid double counting of this settlement. Reacquired rights are amortizable over the remaining contractual period of the contract in which the rights were granted and estimated to be approximately\n24\nyears from the acquisition date.\nGoodwill is the result of expected synergies from the operations of the combined company and future customer relationships including the brand names and strategic partner relationships of Caesars and the technology and assembled workforce of William Hill. The goodwill acquired will not generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes.\nThe fair value of long-term debt assumed has been calculated based on market quotes.\nThe Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $\n68\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, excluding additional transaction costs associated with sale of William Hill International. These costs were primarily associated with legal and professional services and were recorded in Transaction costs and other operating costs in our Statements of Operations.\nFor the period of April 22, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the operations of William Hill generated net revenues of $\n183\nmillion, excluding discontinued operations (see Note 4), and a net loss of $\n415\nmillion.\n75\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the William Hill Acquisition as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and William Hill prior to the acquisition, with adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition. The pro forma results include adjustments and consequential tax effects to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired, eliminate gains and losses related to certain investments and adjustments to the timing of acquisition related costs and expenses incurred during the year ended December 31, 2021. The unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred had the William Hill Acquisition been consummated as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of any future results.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information does not include the operations of William Hill International as such operations were expected to be divested upon the acquisition date.\nConsolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore\nOn August 26, 2021, the Company increased its ownership interest in Horseshoe Baltimore, a property which it also manages, to approximately\n75.8\n% for cash consideration of $\n55\nmillion. Subsequent to the change in ownership, the Company was determined to have a controlling financial interest and has begun to consolidate the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore.\nPrior to the purchase, the Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately\n44.3\n% which was accounted for as an equity method investment. Our previously held investment was remeasured as of the date of our change in ownership and the Company recorded a gain of approximately $\n40\nmillion, which was recorded in Other income (loss) on our Statements of Operations.\nPreliminary Purchase Price Allocation\nThe purchase price allocation for Horseshoe Baltimore is preliminary as it relates to determining the fair value of certain assets and liabilities, including potential goodwill, and is subject to change. The estimated fair values are based on management’s analysis, including preliminary work performed by a third-party valuation specialist, which is subject to finalization over the one-year measurement period.\nThe following table summarizes the preliminary allocation of the purchase consideration to the\n76\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nidentifiable assets and liabilities of Horseshoe Baltimore, with any potential excess recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2021:\n____________________\n(a)\nIntangible assets consist of gaming rights valued at $\n43\nmillion and customer relationships valued at $\n10\nmillion.\nAs noted above, the preliminary purchase price allocation is subject to a measurement period and our estimates as of September 30, 2021 have been revised. The net impact of these changes in our preliminary valuations was a $\n102\nmillion increase to property and equipment, net, a $\n63\nmillion increase to goodwill, a $\n188\nmillion decrease to intangible assets, a $\n47\nmillion increase to other noncurrent assets, and a $\n24\nmillion increase in other long-term liabilities. The effect of these revisions during the quarter did not have a material impact on our Statements of Operations.\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets acquired in the Horseshoe Baltimore acquisition make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets.\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the Horseshoe Baltimore acquisition date.\nOther personal property assets such as furniture, equipment, computer hardware, and fixtures were valued at the existing carrying values as they closely represented the estimated fair value of those items at the Horseshoe Baltimore acquisition date. The fair value of the buildings and improvements were estimated via the income approach. The remaining estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements is\n40\nyears.\nThe right of use asset and operating lease liability related to a ground lease for the site on which Horseshoe Baltimore is located was recorded at fair value and will be amortized over the estimated remaining useful life due to changes in the underlying fair value and estimated remaining useful life of the building and improvements. Renewal options are considered to be reasonably certain. The income approach was used to determine fair value, based on the estimated present value of the future lease payments over the lease term, including renewal options, using an incremental borrowing rate of approximately\n7.6\n%.\nCustomer relationships are valued using an income approach, comparing the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced. We estimate the useful life of these customer relationships to be approximately\nseven years\n.\nThe fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings method, which is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The acquired gaming rights are considered to have an indefinite life.\nThe goodwill acquired will generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes.\nThe fair value of long-term debt has been calculated based on market quotes.\n77\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFor the period of August 26, 2021 through December 31, 2021, the operations of Horseshoe Baltimore generated net revenues of $\n72\nmillion, and a net income of $\n4\nmillion.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the Horseshoe Baltimore consolidation as if it had occurred on January 1, 2020. The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and Horseshoe Baltimore prior to the consolidation. The pro forma results include adjustments and consequential tax effects to reflect incremental amortization expense to be incurred based on preliminary fair values of the identifiable intangible assets acquired and the adjustments to eliminate certain revenues and expenses which are considered intercompany activities.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of the financial results that would have occurred had the consolidation of Horseshoe Baltimore occurred as of the dates indicated, nor is it indicative of any future results. In addition, the unaudited pro forma financial information does not reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the consolidation.\nMerger with Caesars Entertainment Corporation\nOn July 20, 2020, the Merger was consummated and Former Caesars became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The strategic rationale for the Merger includes, but is not limited to, the following:\n•\nCreation of the largest owner, operator and manager of domestic gaming assets\n•\nDiversification of the Company’s domestic footprint\n•\nAccess to iconic brands, rewards programs and new gaming opportunities expected to enhance customer experience\n•\nRealization of significant identified synergies\nThe total purchase consideration for Former Caesars was $\n10.9\nbillion. The estimated purchase consideration in the acquisition was determined with reference to its acquisition date fair value.\n____________________\n(a)\nFormer Caesars common stock was converted into the right to receive approximately\n0.3085\nshares of the Company’s Common Stock, with a value equal to approximately $\n12.41\nin cash (based on the volume weighted average price per share of the Company’s Common Stock for the ten trading days ending on July 16, 2020).\n78\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFinal Purchase Price Allocation\nThe fair values are based on management’s analysis including work performed by third party valuation specialists, which were finalized over the one-year measurement period.\nThe following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase consideration to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed of Former Caesars, with the excess recorded as goodwill as of December 31, 2021:\n____________________\n(a)\nIntangible assets consist of gaming rights valued at $\n396\nmillion, trade names valued at $\n2.1\nbillion, the Caesars Rewards programs valued at $\n523\nmillion and customer relationships valued at $\n425\nmillion.\nThe fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed were determined using the market, income, and cost approaches, or a combination. Valuation methodologies under both a market and income approach used for the identifiable net assets acquired in the Former Caesars acquisition make use of Level 3 inputs, such as expected cash flows and projected financial results. The market approach indicates value for a subject asset based on available market pricing for comparable assets.\nTrade receivables and payables and other current and noncurrent assets and liabilities were valued at the existing carrying values as they represented the estimated fair value of those items at the Former Caesars acquisition date. Assets and liabilities held for sale are recorded at fair value, less costs to sell, based on the agreements reached as of the acquisition date, or an income approach.\nCertain financial assets acquired were determined to have experienced more than insignificant deterioration of credit quality since origination.\nA reconciliation of the difference between the purchase price of financial assets, including acquired markers, and the face value of the assets is as follows:\nThe fair value of land was determined using the sales comparable approach. The market data is then adjusted for any significant differences, to the extent known, between the identified comparable sites and the site being valued. The value of building and site improvements was estimated via the income approach. Other personal property assets such as furniture, gaming and computer equipment, fixtures, computer software, and restaurant equipment were valued using the cost approach which is based on replacement or reproduction costs of the asset. The cost approach is an estimation of fair value developed by computing the current cost of replacing a property and subtracting any depreciation resulting from one or more of the following factors: physical deterioration, functional obsolescence, and/or economic obsolescence.\nNon-amortizing intangible assets acquired primarily include trademarks, Caesars Rewards and gaming rights. The fair value for these intangible assets was determined using either the relief from royalty method and excess earnings method under the income approach or a replacement cost market approach.\nTrademarks and Caesars Rewards were valued using the relief from royalty method, which presumes that without ownership of such trademarks or loyalty program, the Company would have to make a stream of payments to a brand or franchise owner in\n79\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nreturn for the right to use their name or program. By virtue of this asset, the Company avoids any such payments and records the related intangible value of the Company’s ownership of the brand name or program. The acquired trademarks, including Caesars Rewards are indefinite lived intangible assets.\nCustomer relationships are valued using an income approach, comparing the prospective cash flows with and without the customer relationships in place to estimate the fair value of the customer relationships, with the fair value assumed to be equal to the discounted cash flows of the business that would be lost if the customer relationships were not in place and needed to be replaced. We estimate the useful life of these customer relationships to be approximately\nseven years\nfrom the Merger date.\nGaming rights include our gaming licenses in various jurisdictions and may have indefinite lives or an estimated useful life. The fair value of the gaming rights was determined using the excess earnings or replacement cost methodology, based on whether the license resides in gaming jurisdictions where competition is limited to a specified number of licensed gaming operators. The excess earnings methodology is an income approach methodology that estimates the projected cash flows of the business attributable to the gaming license intangible asset, which is net of charges for the use of other identifiable assets of the business including working capital, fixed assets and other intangible assets. The replacement cost of the gaming license was used as an indicator of fair value. The acquired gaming rights have indefinite lives, with the exception of one jurisdiction in which we estimate the useful life of the license to be approximately\n34\nyears from the Merger date.\nGoodwill is the result of expected synergies from the operations of the combined company and the assembled workforce of Former Caesars. The final assignment of goodwill to reporting units has not been completed. The goodwill acquired will not generate amortization deductions for income tax purposes.\nThe fair value of long-term debt has been calculated based on market quotes. The fair value of the financing obligations were calculated as the net present value of both the fixed base rent payments and the forecasted variable payments plus the expected residual value of the land and building returned at the end of the expected usage period.\nThe Company recognized acquisition-related transaction costs of $\n30\nmillion, $\n160\nmillion and $\n80\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in connection with the Merger. Transaction costs were associated with legal, IT costs, internal labor and professional services and were recorded in Transaction costs and other operating costs in our Statements of Operations.\nFor the period of July 20, 2020 through December 31, 2020, the properties of Former Caesars generated net revenues of $\n2.1\nbillion, excluding discontinued operations, and a net loss of $\n1.2\nbillion.\nUnaudited Pro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma financial information is presented to illustrate the estimated effects of the acquisition of Former Caesars as if it had occurred on January 1, 2019. The pro forma amounts include the historical operating results of the Company and Former Caesars prior to the acquisition, with adjustments directly attributable to the acquisition. The pro forma results include adjustments and consequential tax effects to reflect incremental depreciation and amortization expense to be incurred based on preliminary fair values of the identifiable property and equipment and intangible assets acquired, the incremental interest expense associated with the issuance of debt to finance the acquisition and the adjustments to exclude acquisition related costs incurred during the year ended December 31, 2020 as if incurred on January 1, 2019.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information is not necessarily indicative of what the consolidated results of operations of the combined company were, nor does it reflect the expected realization of any synergies or cost savings associated with the acquisition.\nNote 4.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nThe Company periodically divests assets that it does not consider core to its business to raise capital or, in some cases, to comply with conditions, terms, obligations or restrictions imposed by antitrust, gaming and other regulatory entities. The carrying value of assets that meet the criteria for asset held for sale are compared to the expected selling price and any expected losses are recorded immediately. Gains or losses associated with the disposal of assets held for sale are recorded within other operating costs, unless the assets represent a discontinued operation.\n80\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nHeld for sale - Continuing operations\nBaton Rouge\nOn December 1, 2020, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell the operations of Belle of Baton Rouge Casino & Hotel (“Baton Rouge”) to CQ Holding Company, Inc. As a result, an impairment charge totaling $\n50\nmillion was recorded during the year ended December 31, 2020 due to the carrying value exceeding the estimated net sales proceeds. The transaction has received regulatory approvals and is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to other customary closing conditions. Baton Rouge met the requirements for presentation as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2021.\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale within continuing operations, accounted for at carrying value unless fair value is lower, were as follows as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe following information presents the net revenues and net loss of our held for sale property, with operations included in continuing operations, that has not been sold:\nHeld for sale - Sold\nPresque, Nemacolin, Mountaineer, Caruthersville, Cape Girardeau, Kansas City, Vicksburg, Shreveport, MontBleu, and Evansville Divestitures\nThe sale of Presque Isle Downs & Casino (“Presque”) closed on January 11, 2019 resulting in a gain on sale of $\n22\nmillion, net of final working capital adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2019. The sale of Lady Luck Casino Nemacolin (“Nemacolin”) closed on March 8, 2019 resulting in a gain of less than $\n1\nmillion on the sale, net of final working capital adjustments, for the year ended December 31, 2019.

Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of William Hill International are classified as held for sale with operations presented within discontinued operations. See Note 1 and Note 2.\nThe following information presents the net revenues and net income (loss) for the Company’s properties that are part of discontinued operations for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nThe assets and liabilities held for sale as discontinued operations, accounted for at carrying value unless fair value was lower, were as follows as of December 31, 2020:\n____________________\n(a)\nWe have included $\n5\nmillion and $\n331\nmillion of deferred finance obligations as held for sale liabilities for and Harrah’s Louisiana Downs and Caesars Southern Indiana, respectively, which represent the estimated liability derecognized upon completion of the divestitures.\nNot included in the above table are assets and liabilities held for sale of $\n3.8\nbillion and $\n2.7\nbillion, respectively, related to William Hill International. Liabilities held for sale include $\n617\nmillion of debt related to the asset sale bridge facility and the revolving credit facility, which are expected to be repaid upon the sale of William Hill International, as described in Note 1. The Bridge Credit Agreement includes a financial covenant requiring the Bridge Facility Borrower to maintain a maximum total net leverage ratio of\n10.50\nto 1.00. The borrowings under the Bridge Credit Agreement are guaranteed by the Bridge Facility Borrower and its material wholly-owned subsidiaries (subject to exceptions), and are secured by a pledge of substantially all of the existing and future property and assets of the Bridge Facility Borrower and the guarantors (subject to exceptions). In addition, $\n943\nmillion of debt is held for sale related to two trust deeds assumed in the William Hill Acquisition. One trust deed relates to £\n350\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.750\n% Senior Notes due 2026, and the other trust deed relates to £\n350\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n4.875\n% Senior Notes due 2023. Each of the trust deeds contain a put option due to a change in control which allowed noteholders to require the Company to purchase the notes at\n101\n% of the principal amount with interest accrued. The put period with respect to the William Hill Acquisition expired on July 26, 2021, and approximately £\n1\nmillion of debt was repurchased. As of December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with the financial covenant related to the Bridge Credit Agreement and no financial covenants were noted related to the two trust deeds assumed in the William Hill Acquisition.\nNote 5.\nInvestments in and Advances to Unconsolidated Affiliates\nWilliam Hill\nThe Company previously entered into a\n25\n-year agreement with William Hill, which became effective January 29, 2019, and granted to William Hill the right to conduct betting activities, including operating our sportsbooks, in retail channels under certain skins for online channels with respect to the Company’s current and future properties, and conduct certain real money online gaming activities. On April 22, 2021, the Company consummated its previously announced acquisition of William Hill PLC in an all-cash transaction. Prior to the acquisition, the Company accounted for its investment in William Hill PLC as an investment in equity securities. Additionally, we accounted for our investment in William Hill US as an equity method\n83\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\ninvestment prior to the William Hill Acquisition. See Note 3 for further detail on the consideration transferred and the allocation of the purchase price.\nNeoGames\nThe acquired net assets of William Hill included an investment in NeoGames S.A. (“NeoGames”), a global leader of iLottery solutions and services to national and state-regulated lotteries, and other investments. On September 16, 2021, the Company sold a portion of its shares of NeoGames common stock for $\n136\nmillion which decreased its ownership interest from\n24.5\n% to approximately\n8.4\n%. As of December 31, 2021, the Company held approximately\n2\nmillion shares of NeoGames common stock with a fair value of $\n60\nmillion. The shares have a readily determinable fair value and, accordingly, the Company remeasures the investment based on the publicly available share price (Level 1). See Note 8. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a loss related to the investment in NeoGames of $\n54\nmillion, which is included within Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nPompano Joint Venture\nIn April 2018, the Company entered into a joint venture with Cordish Companies (“Cordish”) to plan and develop a mixed-use entertainment and hospitality destination expected to be located on unused land adjacent to the casino and racetrack at the Company’s Pompano property. As the managing member, Cordish will operate the business and manage the development, construction, financing, marketing, leasing, maintenance and day-to-day operation of the various phases of the project. Additionally, Cordish will be responsible for the development of the master plan for the project with the Company’s input and will submit it for the Company’s review and approval. In June 2021, the joint venture issued a capital call and we contributed $\n3\nmillion, for a total of $\n4\nmillion in cash contributions since inception of the joint venture. On February 12, 2021, the Company contributed\n186\nacres to the joint venture with a fair value of $\n61\nmillion. Total contributions of approximately\n206\nacres of land have been made with a fair value of approximately $\n69\nmillion, and the Company has no further obligation to contribute additional real estate or cash as of December 31, 2021. We entered into a short-term lease agreement in February 2021, which we can cancel at any time, to lease back a portion of the land from the joint venture.\nWhile the Company holds a\n50\n% variable interest in the joint venture, it is not the primary beneficiary; as such the investment in the joint venture is accounted for using the equity method. The Company participates evenly with Cordish in the profits and losses of the joint venture, which are included in Transaction costs and other operating costs on the Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company’s investment in the joint venture is recorded in Investment in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates on the Balance Sheets.\nNote 6.\nProperty and Equipment\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, except for assets acquired in our business combinations which were adjusted for fair value under ASC 805. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset as noted in the table below, or the term of the lease, whichever is less. Costs of major improvements are capitalized, while costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Gains or losses on the disposal of property and equipment are included in operating income.\nOur property and equipment is subject to various operating leases for which we are the lessor. We lease our property and equipment related to our hotel rooms, convention space and retail space through various short-term and long-term operating leases. See Note 10 for further discussion of our leases.\nThe Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge may be recorded for any difference between fair value and the carrying value. All\n84\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nrecognized impairment losses, whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses, unless the assets represent a discontinued operation.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2019, an impairment charge of $\n1\nmillion was recorded related to non-operating real property located in Pennsylvania. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a tangible asset impairment of $\n4\nmillion related to the sale of a corporate airplane. See Note 4 for further discussion of impairment on assets held for sale.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the related lease.\nNote 7.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, net\nThe purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The Company determines the estimated fair values after review and consideration of relevant information including discounted cash flows, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management. To the extent the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, such excess is recorded as goodwill.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests as of October 1 of each fiscal year. The Company performs this assessment more frequently if impairment indicators exist. We utilized an income approach using a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of our goodwill. The Company performed the annual goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. The Company determines the estimated fair value of each reporting unit based on a combination of earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), valuation multiples, and estimated future cash flows discounted at rates commensurate with the capital structure and cost of capital of comparable market participants, giving appropriate consideration to the prevailing borrowing rates within the casino industry in general. The Company also evaluates the aggregate fair value of all of its reporting units and other non-operating assets in comparison to its aggregate debt and equity market capitalization at the test date. EBITDA multiples and discounted cash flows are common measures used to value businesses in the industry.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of trademarks and expenditures associated with obtaining racing and gaming licenses. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are not subject to amortization but are subject to an annual impairment test. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess amount.\nGaming rights represent intangible assets acquired from the purchase of a gaming entity located in a gaming jurisdiction where competition is limited, such as when only a limited number of gaming operators are allowed to operate in the jurisdiction. These gaming license rights are not subject to amortization as the Company has determined that they have indefinite useful lives. For gaming jurisdictions with high barriers of renewal of the gaming rights, such as material costs of renewal, the gaming rights are deemed to have a finite useful life and are amortized over the expected useful life. We used the Excess Earnings Method and a Cost Approach for estimating fair value for these gaming rights.\n85\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFinite-lived intangible assets consist of trade names and customer relationships acquired in business combinations. Amortization is recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset. The Company evaluates for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. When indicators are noted, the Company then compares estimated future cash flows, undiscounted, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is recorded.\nIn December 2021, the Company approved a capital plan which included the planned rebranding of certain of our properties, which is expected to be substantially complete by December 31, 2022. The Company utilized an income approach to determine the fair value of the trademarks subject to rebranding based on their expected future cash flows, which resulted in an impairment charge of $\n102\nmillion. The adjusted carrying values of these trademarks, previously considered to have indefinite lives, have begun to be amortized over their respective remaining useful lives.\nDuring 2020, the Company recognized impairment charges in our Regional segment related to goodwill and trade names totaling $\n100\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion, respectively, due to declines in recent performance and the expected impact on future cash flows as a result of COVID-19.\nWhen assets are deemed to be held for sale, any associated intangible assets, including goodwill, are reclassified to Assets held for sale on our Balance Sheets (see Note 4).\n____________________\n(a)\nSee Note 3 for further detail.\n(b)\n$\n352\nmillion of goodwill within our Regional segment is associated with reporting units with zero or negative carrying value.\n86\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n____________________\n(a)\nSee Note 3 for further detail.\n(b)\nIncludes acquired royalty-free license of Planet Hollywood Trademark with an estimated useful life of\n15\nyears and other gaming rights.\nAmortization expense with respect to intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $\n139\nmillion, $\n56\nmillion and $\n30\nmillion, respectively, which is included in depreciation and amortization in the Statements of Operations.\n87\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nNote 8.\nFair Value Measurements\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table sets forth the assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis, by input level, in the Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nRestricted Cash and Investments\nThe estimated fair values of the Company’s restricted cash and investments are based upon quoted prices available in active markets (Level 1), or quoted prices for similar assets in active and inactive markets (Level 2), or quoted prices available in active markets adjusted for time restrictions related to the sale of the investment (Level 3) and represent the amounts the Company would expect to receive if the Company sold the restricted cash and investments. Restricted cash classified as Level 1 includes cash equivalents held in short-term certificate of deposit accounts or money market type funds. Restricted cash that is not subject to remeasurement on a recurring basis is not included in the table above. Restricted investments included shares acquired in conjunction with the Company’s sports betting agreements that contained restrictions related to the ability to liquidate shares within a specified timeframe. As a result of the William Hill Acquisition, no restricted investments are held as of December 31, 2021.\nMarketable Securities\nMarketable securities consist primarily of trading securities held by the Company’s captive insurance subsidiary and investments acquired in the William Hill Acquisition (see Note 5). These investments also include collateral for several escrow and trust agreements with third-party beneficiaries. The estimated fair values of the Company’s marketable securities are\n88\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\ndetermined on an individual asset basis based upon quoted prices of identical assets available in active markets (Level 1), quoted prices of identical assets in inactive markets, or quoted prices for similar assets in active and inactive markets (Level 2), and represent the amounts the Company would expect to receive if the Company sold these marketable securities.\nThe Company held common shares of Flutter Entertainment PLC (“Flutter”), which is a publicly traded company with a readily determinable share price. The Flutter shares contained certain restrictions which expired in December 2020. As such, the shares were transferred from a Level 3 investment to a Level 1 investment. There were no other transfers between Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3 investments. During the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company sold a portion of these shares for $\n24\nmillion and recorded a gain of $\n14\nmillion. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value of shares held was $\n10\nmillion, and was included in Prepayments and other current assets on the Balance Sheets.\nOn July 7, 2021, the Company sold these shares for $\n9\nmillion and recorded a loss of $\n1\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021. Gains and losses have been included in Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company does not purchase or hold any derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.\n5\n% Convertible Notes - Derivative Liability\nOn October 6, 2017, Former Caesars issued $\n1.1\nbillion aggregate principal amount of\n5\n% convertible senior notes maturing in 2024 (“\n5\n% Convertible Notes”) which contained a derivative liability. On June 29, 2021, all outstanding\n5\n% Convertible Notes were converted as a result of our mandatory conversion. See Note 12 for further discussion. The derivative liability associated with the conversion feature no longer exists following the mandatory conversion.\nForward contracts\nT\nhe Company has entered into several foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rates between USD and GBP and to fix the exchange rate for a portion of the funds used in the William Hill Acquisition, repayment of related debt, and expected proceeds of the sale of the international operations. Three of these forward contracts to purchase £\n724\nmillion at a contracted exchange rate were settled on June 11, 2021 and December 31, 2021, resulting in total gains of $\n38\nmillion,\nwhich were recorded in the Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company is contracted\nto sell a total of £\n790\nmillion at fixed exchange rates. These contracts are to hedge the risk of fluctuations in the foreign exchange rate related to a portion of the expected proceeds from the sale of William Hill International. The forward term of these contracts ends in March 2022. The Company recorded a loss of $\n15\nmillion during the\nyear\nended\nDecember 31, 2021, related to these forward contracts, which was recorded in the Other income (loss) on the Statements of Operations.\nInterest Rate Swap Derivatives\nWe assumed Former Caesars’ interest rate swaps to manage the mix of assumed debt between fixed and variable rate instruments. As of December 31, 2021, we have\nfour\ninterest rate swap agreements to fix the interest rate on $\n1.3\nbillion of variable rate debt related to the CRC Credit Agreement. The interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. The difference to be paid or received under the terms of the interest rate swap agreements is accrued as interest rates change and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense at settlement. Changes in the variable interest rates to be received pursuant to the terms of the interest rate swap agreements will have a corresponding effect on future cash flows.\nThe major terms of the interest rate swap agreements as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nValuation Methodology\nThe estimated fair values of our interest rate swap derivative instruments are derived from market prices obtained from dealer quotes for similar, but not identical, assets or liabilities. Such quotes represent the estimated amounts we would receive or pay\n89\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nto terminate the contracts. The interest rate swap derivative instruments are included in either Other assets, net or Other long-term liabilities on our Balance Sheets. Our derivatives are recorded at their fair values, adjusted for the credit rating of the counterparty if the derivative is an asset, or adjusted for the credit rating of the Company if the derivative is a liability. None of our derivative instruments are offset and all were classified as Level 2.\nFinancial Statement Effect\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as hedging instruments on the Balance Sheets for amounts transferred into Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (“AOCI”) before tax was a gain of $\n62\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. AOCI reclassified to Interest expense on the Statements of Operations was $\n59\nmillion and $\n31\nmillion, for years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the interest rate swaps derivative liability of $\n28\nmillion and $\n90\nmillion, respectively, was recorded in Other long-term liabilities. Net settlement of these interest rate swaps results in the reclassification of deferred gains and losses within AOCI to be reclassified to the income statement as a component of interest expense as settlements occur. The estimated amount of existing gains or losses that are reported in AOCI at the reporting date that are expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months is approximately $\n28\nmillion.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income\nThe changes in AOCI by component, net of tax, for the periods through December 31, 2021 and 2020 are shown below.\nNote 9.\nAccrued Other Liabilities\nAccrued other liabilities consisted of the following:\nDisputed Claims Liability and Exit Cost Accrual\nThe disputed claims liability and exit cost accrual were assumed liabilities of Former Caesars. The disputed claims liability represents certain remaining unsecured claims related to Former Caesars bankruptcy for which we have estimated the fair value of the remaining liability. Exit costs are related to the unbundling of electric service provided by NV Energy and an Iowa greyhound pari-mutuel racing fund which we assumed from the Merger and other system contracts.\n90\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nNote 10.\nLeases\nThe Company has operating and finance leases for various real estate and equipment. Certain of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments based on a percentage of sales over specified contractual amounts, rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation and rental payments based on usage. The Company’s leases include options to extend the lease term\none month\nto\n75\nyears. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants, other than those described below.\nLessee Arrangements\nOperating Leases\nWe lease real estate and equipment used in our operations from third parties. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining term of our operating leases ranged from\n1\nto\n75\nyears with various extension options available, if we elect to exercise them. However, our remaining terms only include extension options that we have determined are reasonably certain as of December 31, 2021. In addition to minimum rental commitments, certain of our operating leases provide for contingent rentals based on a percentage of revenues in excess of specified amounts. We do not include costs associated with our non-lease components in our lease costs disclosed in the table below. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we obtained $\n13\nmillion and $\n38\nmillion, respectively, of right-of-use (“ROU”) assets in exchange for new lease liabilities.\nLeases recorded on the balance sheet consist of the following:\n___________________\n(a)\nAs noted above, we have elected the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption and do not establish ROU assets or liabilities for operating leases with terms of 12 months or less.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases is as follows:\n91\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nFinance Leases\nWe have finance leases for certain equipment and real estate. As of December 31, 2021, our finance leases had remaining lease terms of up to approximately\n37\nyears, some of which include options to extend the lease terms in one month increments. Our finance lease\nROU assets\nand\nliabilities\nwere $\n40\nmillion and $\n43\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, respectively, and $\n64\nmillion for both finance lease ROU assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2020.\nFinancing Obligations\nVICI Leases & Golf Course Use Agreement\nThe fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of\n15\nyears, plus renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately\n11.01\n%.\nCEI leases certain real property assets from VICI under the following agreements: (i) for a portfolio of properties located throughout the United States (the “Regional Lease”), (ii) for Caesars Palace Las Vegas and Harrah’s Las Vegas (the “Las Vegas Lease”), and (iii) for Harrah’s Joliet Hotel & Casino (the “Joliet Lease”), (collectively, “VICI Leases”). The lease agreements, inclusive of all amendments, include (i) a\n15-year\ninitial term with\nfour\nfive-year\nrenewal options, (ii) annual fixed rent payments of $\n1.1\nbillion, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the Consumer Price Index (“CPI”) and a\n2\n% floor commencing in lease year\ntwo\nof the initial term and (iii) a variable element based on net revenues of the underlying leased properties, commencing in lease year\neight\nof the initial term.\nThe Regional Lease includes a put-call option whereby the Company may require VICI to purchase and lease back (as lessor) or whereby VICI may require the Company to sell to VICI and lease back (as lessee) the real estate components of the gaming and racetrack facilities of Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing & Casino and Indiana Grand (“Centaur properties”). Election to exercise the option by either party must be made during the election period beginning January 1, 2022 and ending December 31, 2024. Upon either party exercising their option, the Centaur properties would be sold at a price in accordance with the agreement and leased back to CEI in accordance to the pre-existing terms of the Regional Lease.\nThe sale of Caesars Southern Indiana to EBCI for $\n250\nmillion was finalized on September 3, 2021 and as a result of the sale, Caesars’ annual payments to VICI Properties under the Regional Lease decreased by $\n33\nmillion and variable rent under the lease shall exclude net revenue attributable to Caesars Southern Indiana.\nThe Golf Course Use Agreement between the Company and VICI, encompassing four golf courses in three states, has a\n35-year\nterm (inclusive of all renewal periods), whereby the Company agrees to pay (i) an annual membership fee of $\n11\nmillion, subject to annual escalation provisions based on the CPI and a\n2\n% floor (ii) annual use fees of $\n3\nmillion, including escalation provisions based on the CPI and a\n2\n% floor commencing on the second lease year through and including the final lease year and (iii) certain per-round fees, as set forth in the agreement. Furthermore, the term of the Golf Course Use Agreement was extended such that there will be\n15\nyears remaining until the expiration of the initial term.\nGLPI Leases\nThe fair value of the real estate assets and the related failed sale-leaseback financing obligations were estimated based on the present value of the estimated future lease payments over the lease term of\n35\nyears, including renewal options, using an imputed discount rate of approximately\n9.75\n%. The value of the failed sale-leaseback financing obligations is dependent upon assumptions regarding the amount of the lease payments and the estimated discount rate of the lease payments required by a market participant.\n92\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nCEI leases certain real property assets from GLPI under the Master Lease (as amended, the “GLPI Master Lease”). The GLPI Master Lease, encompassing a portfolio of properties within the United States, provides for the lease of land, buildings, structures and other improvements on the land (including barges and riverboats), easements and similar appurtenances to the land and improvements relating to the operation of the leased properties.

The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2021.\n93\nLessor Arrangements\nLodging Arrangements\nLodging arrangements are considered short-term and generally consist of lease and nonlease components. The lease component is the predominant component of the arrangement and consists of the fees charged for lodging. The nonlease components primarily consist of resort fees and other miscellaneous items. As the timing and pattern of transfer of both the lease and nonlease components are over the course of the lease term, we have elected to combine the revenue generated from lease and nonlease components into a single lease component based on the predominant component in the arrangement. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n450\nmillion, respectively, in lease revenue related to lodging arrangements, which is included in Hotel revenues in the Statements of Operations.\nConventions\nConvention arrangements are considered short-term and generally consist of lease and nonlease components.

In addition to minimum rental commitments, certain of our operating leases provide for contingent payments including contingent rentals based on a percentage of revenues in excess of specified amounts and reimbursements for common area maintenance and utilities charges. As the timing and pattern of transfer of both the lease and nonlease components are over the course of the lease term, we have elected to combine the revenue generated from lease and nonlease components into a single lease component based on the predominant component in the arrangement. In addition, to maintain the value of our leased assets, certain leases include specific maintenance requirements of the lessees or maintenance is performed by the Company on behalf of the lessees. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $\n149\nmillion and $\n41\nmillion, respectively, of real estate lease revenue, which is included in Other revenue in the Statement of Operations.\nReal estate lease revenue includes $\n45\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion, respectively, of variable rental income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 11.\nLitigation, Commitments and Contingencies\nLitigation\nGeneral\nWe are a party to various legal proceedings, which have arisen in the normal course of our business. Such proceedings can be costly, time consuming and unpredictable and, therefore, no assurance can be given that the final outcome of such proceedings will not materially impact our consolidated financial condition or results of operations. Estimated losses are accrued for these proceedings when the loss is probable and can be estimated. While we maintain insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to mitigate the risks of such proceedings, no assurance can be given that the amount or scope of existing insurance coverage will be sufficient to cover losses arising from such matters. The current liability for the estimated losses associated with these proceedings is not material to our consolidated financial condition and those estimated losses are not expected to have a material impact on our results of operations.\n94\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nCOVID-19 Insurance Claims\nThe COVID-19 public health emergency had a significant impact on the Company’s business and employees, as well as the communities where the Company operates and serves.

The Company submitted claims for losses incurred as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency which are expected to exceed $\n2\nbillion. The insurance carriers under the Company’s insurance policies have asserted that the policies do not cover losses incurred by the Company as a result of the COVID-19 public health emergency and have refused to make payments under the applicable policies. Therefore, on March 19, 2021, the Company filed a lawsuit against its insurance carriers in the state court in Clark County, Nevada.

The Company recognizes as casino revenue the net win from gaming activities, which is the difference between gaming wins and losses, not the total amount wagered. Progressive jackpots are accrued and charged to revenue at the time the obligation to pay the jackpot is established. Gaming revenues are recognized net of free bets, free play, matched deposits, and other similar incentives to its customers. During significant promotional periods, such as entering new jurisdictions with our Caesars Sportsbook app, such activity could result in negative net gaming revenue. Such periods are not expected to be long in duration. Pari-mutuel commissions consist of commissions earned from thoroughbred and harness racing and importing of simulcast signals from other race tracks and are recognized at the time wagers are made. Such commissions are a designated portion of the wagering handle as determined by state racing commissions and are shown net of the taxes assessed by state and local agencies, as well as purses and other contractual amounts paid to horsemen associations. The Company recognizes revenues from fees earned through the exporting of simulcast signals to other race tracks at the time wagers are made, which are recorded on a gross basis. Such fees are based upon a predetermined percentage of handle as contracted with the other race tracks.\nNon-gaming Revenues\nHotel, food and beverage, and other operating revenues are recognized as services are performed and is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. Hotel, food and beverage services have been determined to be separate, stand-alone performance obligations and are recorded as revenue as the good or service is transferred to the customer over the customer’s stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food and beverage. Advance deposits for future hotel occupancy, convention space or food and beverage services contract are recorded as deferred income until revenue recognition criteria has been met. The Company also provides goods and services that may include multiple performance obligations, such as for packages, for which revenues are allocated on a pro rata basis based on each service’s stand-alone selling price.\nSales and other taxes collected from customers on behalf of governmental authorities are accounted for on a net basis and are not included in net revenues or operating expenses.\nThe Company’s Statement of Operations presents net revenue disaggregated by type or nature of the good or service. A summary of net revenues disaggregated by type of revenue and reportable segment is presented below. We recast previously reported segment amounts to conform to the way management assesses results and allocates resources for the current year. Refer to Note 1 and Note 19 for additional information on the Company’s reportable segments.\n100\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nAccounts Receivable and Credit Risk\nWe issue credit to approved casino customers following investigations of creditworthiness. Business or economic conditions or other significant events could affect the collectability of these receivables. Accounts receivable are non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost.\nMarker play represents a meaningful portion of our overall table games volume. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from those customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts include the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers who are not residents of the United States.\nTrade receivables, including casino and hotel receivables, are typically non-interest bearing. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The allowance is estimated based on specific review of customer accounts, historical collection experience and reasonable forecasts which consider current economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020,\nno\nsignificant concentrations of credit risk related to receivables existed.\nReserve for Uncollectible Accounts Receivable\nWe reserve an estimated amount for receivables that may not be collected. Methodologies for estimating bad debt reserves range from specific reserves to various percentages applied to aged receivables. Historical collection rates are considered, as are customer relationships, in determining specific reserves. As with many estimates, management must make judgments about potential actions by third parties in establishing and evaluating our reserves for bad debts.\n101\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n____________________\n(a)\n“Other” includes allowance associated with lease receivables under ASC 842. See Note 10 for further details.\nContract and Contract Related Liabilities\nThe Company records contract or contract-related liabilities related to differences between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer,(2) player loyalty program obligations, subsequently combined as Caesars Rewards, which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to reward credits granted to Caesars Rewards members based on on-property spending, including gaming, hotel, dining, retail shopping, and player loyalty program incentives earned, and (3) customer deposits and other deferred revenue, which is primarily funds deposited by customers related to gaming play, advance payments received for goods and services yet to be provided (such as advance ticket sales, deposits on rooms and convention space, unpaid wagers, iGaming deposits, or future sports bets), these liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within accrued other liabilities on the Company’s Balance Sheets.\nOutstanding Chip Liability\nThe Company recognizes the impact on gaming revenues on an annual basis to reflect an estimate of the change in the value of outstanding chips that are not expected to be redeemed. This estimate is determined by measuring the difference between the total value of chips placed in service less the value of chips under our control. This measurement is performed on an annual basis utilizing a methodology in which a consistent formula is applied to estimate the percentage of chips not in our custody that are not expected to be redeemed. In addition to the formula, certain judgments are made with regard to various denominations and souvenir chips. The outstanding chip liability is included in accrued other liabilities on the Balance Sheets.\nCaesars Rewards Loyalty Program\nCaesars Rewards grants Reward Credits to Caesars Rewards Members based on on-property spending, including gaming, hotel, dining, and retail shopping at all Caesars-affiliated properties. Members may redeem Reward Credits for complimentary or discounted goods and services such as rooms, food and beverages, merchandise, free play, entertainment, and travel accommodations. Members are able to accumulate Reward Credits over time that they may redeem at their discretion under the terms of the program. A member’s Reward Credit balance is forfeited if the member does not earn at least one Reward Credit during a continuous six-month period.\nBecause of the significance of the Caesars Rewards program and the ability for customers to accumulate Reward Credits based on their past play, we have determined that Reward Credits granted in conjunction with other earning activity represent a performance obligation. As a result, for transactions in which Reward Credits are earned, we allocate a portion of the transaction price to the Reward Credits that are earned based upon the relative standalone selling prices (“SSP”) of the goods and services involved. When the activity underlying the “earning” of the Reward Credits has a wide range of selling prices and is highly variable, such as in the case of gaming activities, we use the residual approach in this allocation by computing the value of the Reward Credits as described below and allocating the residual amount to the gaming activity. This allocation results in a significant portion of the transaction price being deferred and presented as a Contract liability on our accompanying Balance Sheets. Any amounts allocated to Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue when the Reward Credits are redeemed in accordance with the specific recognition policy of the activity for which the credits are redeemed.\n102\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nOur Caesars Rewards loyalty program includes various tiers that offer different benefits, and members are able to earn credits towards tier status, which generally enables them to receive discounts similar to those provided as complimentaries described below. We have determined that any such discounts received as a result of tier status do not represent material rights, and therefore, we do not account for them as distinct performance obligations.\nWe have determined the SSP of a Reward Credit by computing the redemption value of credits expected to be redeemed. Because Reward Credits are not otherwise independently sold, we analyzed all Reward Credit redemption activity over the preceding calendar year and determined the redemption value based on the fair market value of the goods and services for which the Reward Credits were redeemed. We have applied the practical expedient under the portfolio approach to our Reward Credit transactions because of the similarity of gaming and other transactions and the homogeneity of Reward Credits.\nAs part of determining the SSP for Reward Credits, we also determined that there is generally an amount of Reward Credits that is not redeemed, which is considered “breakage.” We recognize the expected breakage proportionally with the pattern of revenue recognized related to the redemption of Reward Credits. We periodically reassess our customer behaviors and revise our expectations as deemed necessary on a prospective basis.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:\nThe December 31, 2021 balances exclude liabilities related to assets held for sale recorded in 2021 and 2020 (see Note 4). The significant change in contract and contract-related liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 was primarily due to expansion in the Caesars Digital segment from the legalization of retail and online sports betting in new states. The significant change in customer deposits and other deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily attributed to the liabilities assumed subsequent to the Merger.\nComplimentaries\nThe Company offers discretionary coupons and other discretionary complimentaries to customers outside of the loyalty program such as matching deposits, free bets and free play. Such complimentaries are provided in conjunction with other revenue‑earning activities and are generally provided to encourage additional customer spending on those activities. Accordingly, the Company allocates a portion of the transaction price received from such customers to the complimentary goods and services. The Company performs this allocation based on the SSP of the underlying goods and services, which is determined based upon the weighted-average cash sales prices received for similar services at similar points during the year. The retail value of complimentary food, beverage, hotel rooms and other services provided to customers is recognized as a reduction of revenues for the department which issued the complimentary and revenue for the department redeemed. Complimentaries provided by third parties at the discretion and under the control of the Company is recorded as an expense when incurred.\nThe Company’s revenues included complimentaries and loyalty point redemptions totaling $\n1.0\nbillion, $\n406\nmillion and $\n292\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 14.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income (loss) by the weighted average shares outstanding during the reporting period. Diluted EPS is computed similarly to basic EPS except that the weighted average shares outstanding are increased to include additional shares from the assumed exercise of stock options and the assumed vesting of restricted share units, if dilutive. The number of additional shares is calculated by assuming that outstanding stock options were exercised, that outstanding restricted share units were released and that the proceeds from such activities were used to acquire shares of common stock at the average market price during the reporting period.\nFor a period in which the Company generated a net loss, the weighted average shares outstanding - basic was used in calculating diluted loss per share because using diluted shares would have been anti-dilutive to loss per share.\n103\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nThe following table illustrates the required disclosure of the reconciliation of the numerators and denominators of the basic and diluted net income (loss) per share computations during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nNote 15.\nStock-Based Compensation and Stockholders’ Equity\nStock-Based Awards\nThe Company maintains long-term incentive plans which allow for granting stock-based compensation awards for directors, employees, officers, and consultants or advisers who render services to the Company or its subsidiaries, based on Company Common Stock, including performance-based and incentive stock options, restricted stock or restricted stock units (“RSUs”), performance stock units (“PSUs”), market-based stock units (“MSUs”), stock appreciation rights, and other stock-based awards or dividend equivalents. Forfeitures are recognized in the period in which they occur.\nPerformance Incentive Plans\nIn 2015, the Board of Directors (“Board”) adopted, and the Company’s stockholders approved, ERI’s 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (“2015 Plan”). In 2019, the Company’s Board approved, and the Company’s stockholders approved, the amended and restated 2015 Plan. The amendment to the 2015 Plan allows for\n3\nmillion shares available for grant, plus the number of shares available for issuance under the 2015 Plan on the date the Company’s stockholders approved the amendment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had\n5\nmillion shares available for grant under the 2015 Plan.\nEquity awards granted to employees and executive officers generally vest within\nthree\nto\nfour years\nfrom the grant date either ratably on each anniversary, or entirely at the end of the service period. Awards may also contain performance conditions in addition to time based vesting conditions. Performance awards relate to the achievement of defined levels of performance and will vest and become payable at the end of the vesting period. Performance awards contain targeted performance levels, which may ultimately vest within a range of\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target award, based on defined operating metrics or market performance as compared to a peer group. RSUs granted to non-employee directors generally vest immediately and are issued on the vesting date, or may be deferred.\nTotal stock-based compensation expense in the accompanying Statements of Operations was $\n82\nmillion, $\n79\nmillion and $\n20\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These amounts are included in corporate\n104\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nexpenses and, in the case of certain property positions, general and administrative expenses in the Company’s Statements of Operations.\nRestricted Stock Unit Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, as part of the annual incentive program, the Company granted RSUs to employees of the Company with an aggregate fair value of $\n79\nmillion. Each RSU represents the right to receive payment in respect of one share of the Company’s Common Stock.\nA summary of the RSUs activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented in the following table:\n____________________\n(a)\nRepresents the weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs, which is the share price of our common stock on the grant date.\n(b)\nIncluded are\n23,139\nRSUs granted to non-employee members of the Board during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nPerformance Stock Unit Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted approximately\n81\nthousand PSUs that are scheduled to vest in\nthree years\nfrom the grant date. On the vesting date, recipients will receive between\n0\n% and\n200\n% of the target number of PSUs granted, in the form of Company Common Stock, based on the achievement of specified performance conditions. The fair value of the PSUs is based on the market price of our common stock when a mutual understanding of the key terms and conditions of the awards between the Company and recipient is achieved. The awards are remeasured each period until such an understanding is reached. The aggregate value of PSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n9\nmillion.\nA summary of the PSUs activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented in the following table:\n____________________\n(a)\nGrant date fair value, for which compensation expense of these unvested awards is measured, has not been achieved. This represents the quoted market price of our common stock on the dated indicated.\n(b)\nPSUs were presented with RSUs as of December 31, 2020 in the 2020 Annual Report.\nMarket-Based Stock Unit Activity\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company granted approximately\n147\nthousand MSUs that are scheduled to cliff vest in\nthree years\nfrom the grant date. On the vesting date, recipients will receive between\n0\n% and\n200\n% of the granted MSUs in the form of Company Common Stock based on the achievement of specified market and service conditions. Based on the terms and conditions of the awards, the grant date fair value of the MSUs was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Key assumptions for the Monte Carlo simulation model are the risk-free interest rate, expected volatility, expected dividends and correlation coefficient. The effect of market conditions is considered in determining the grant date fair value, which is not subsequently revised based on actual performance. The aggregate value of MSUs granted during the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n15\nmillion.\n105\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nA summary of the MSUs activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented in the following table:\n____________________\n(a)\nRepresents the grant date fair value determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model.\nUnrecognized Compensation Cost\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n120\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.4\nyears.\nCommon Stock Offerings\nOn June 19, 2020, the Company completed the public offering of\n20,700,000\nshares (including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option) of Company Common Stock, at an offering price of $\n39.00\nper share, which provided $\n772\nmillion of proceeds, net of fees and estimated expenses of $\n35\nmillion.\nOn October 1, 2020, the Company completed the public offering of\n35,650,000\nshares (including the shares sold pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option) of Company Common Stock, at an offering price of $\n56.00\nper share, which provided $\n1.9\nbillion of proceeds, net of fees and estimated expenses of $\n50\nmillion.\nChanges to the Authorized Shares\nOn June 17, 2021, following receipt of required shareholder approvals, the Company amended its Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of common stock from\n300\nmillion to\n500\nmillion, and authorize the issuance of up to\n150\nmillion shares of preferred stock. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\nshares of preferred stock have been issued.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn November 2018, the Board authorized a $\n150\nmillion common stock repurchase program (the “Share Repurchase Program”) pursuant to which the Company may, from time to time, repurchase shares of common stock on the open market (either with or\n106\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nwithout a 10b5-1 plan) or through privately negotiated transactions. The Share Repurchase Program has no time limit and may be suspended or discontinued at any time without notice. There is no minimum number of shares of common stock that the Company is required to repurchase under the Share Repurchase Program.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has acquired\n223,823\nshares of common stock at an aggregate value of $\n9\nmillion and an average of $\n40.80\nper share.\nNo\nshares were repurchased during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nNote 16.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\n401(k) Plans\nThe Company offers several savings and retirement plans to substantially all employees who are not covered by collective bargaining agreements, who meet certain eligibility requirements, namely terms of service. All existing savings and retirement plans transitioned into the Caesars Entertainment, Inc. 401(k) Plan with Prudential Retirement. Under the 401(k) plan, the Company matches contributions equal to\n50\n% of the first\n6\n% as outlined per plan documents.\nThe Company’s matching contribution expense totaled $\n27\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDefined-Benefit Plans\nScioto Downs sponsors a noncontributory defined-benefit plan covering all full-time employees meeting certain age and service requirements. On May 31, 2001, the plan was amended to freeze eligibility, accrual of years of service and benefits. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of the plan assets was $\n1\nmillion, and the fair value of the benefit obligations was $\n1\nmillion. The plan assets are comprised primarily of money market and mutual funds whose values are determined based on quoted market prices and are classified in Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy. We did not make cash contributions to the Scioto Downs pension plan during 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIn addition, the Company also sponsors a defined-benefit plan for certain Tropicana Atlantic City employees under a Variable Annuity Pension Plan. As of December 31, 2021, the fair value of both, the plan assets and benefit obligations, was $\n21\nmillion. Contributions to the plan were less than $\n1\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 and $\n2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Company participated in a defined-benefit plan for employees of the London Clubs International subsidiary that provided benefits based on final pensionable salary. As of December 31, 2020, the plan had a net pension liability of $\n20\nmillion, which was recorded within liabilities held for sale on our Balance Sheets. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we contributed $\n4\nmillion to the plan. On July 16, 2021, the Company completed the sale of Caesars UK Group, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities associated with the Caesars UK Group.\nDeferred Compensation Plans\nCEI assumed Former Caesars deferred compensation plans, the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Executive Supplemental Savings Plan III (“ESSP III”) and the Caesars Entertainment Corporation Outside Director Deferred Compensation Plan. These plans are unfunded, non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Payment obligations pursuant to the plans are unsecured general obligations of the Company and affiliates of the Company employing participants in the ESSP III. The liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n3\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, respectively, which was recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, certain current and former employees of Caesars, and our subsidiaries and affiliates, have balances under: (i) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan, (ii) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Supplemental Savings Plan II, (iii) the Park Place Entertainment Corporation Executive Deferred Compensation Plan, (iv) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Deferred Compensation Plan, and (v) the Harrah’s Entertainment, Inc. Executive Deferred Compensation Plan (collectively, the “existing deferred compensation plans”). These plans are deferred compensation plans that allow certain employees an opportunity to save for retirement and other purposes.\nEach of the plans is now frozen and is no longer accepting contributions. However, participants may still earn returns on existing plan balances based upon their selected investment alternatives, which are reflected in their deferral accounts. The total liability recorded in Deferred credits and other liabilities for these plans was $\n43\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n107\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nTrust Assets\nCEI is a party to a trust agreement (the “Trust Agreement”) and an escrow agreement with respect to all five of the existing deferred compensation plans (the “Escrow Agreement”), each structured as so-called “rabbi trust” arrangements, which holds assets that may be used to satisfy obligations under the existing deferred compensation plans above. Amounts held pursuant to the Trust Agreement and the Escrow Agreement were $\n87\nmillion and $\n94\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and have been reflected within Deferred charges and other assets on the Balance Sheets.\nMulti-employer Pension Plans\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company continues to contribute to a number of multi-employer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover union-represented employees of Former Caesars. Prior to the Merger, no significant contributions were made to such plans. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from a single-employer plan in the following respects:\ni.\nAssets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\nii.\nIf a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers.\niii.\nIf the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunding of the plan, referred to as a “withdrawal liability.”\n____________________\n(a)\nRepresents the Pension Protection Act zone status for applicable plan year beginning January 1, except where noted otherwise. The zone status is based on information that the Company received from the plan administrator and is certified by the plan’s actuary. Among other factors, plans in the red zone are generally less than 65% funded, plans in the yellow zone are between 65% and less than 80% funded, and plans in the green zone are at least 80% funded. All plans detailed in the table above utilized extended amortization provisions to calculate zone status.\n(b)\nIndicates plans for which a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) is either pending or has been implemented.\n(c)\nThe terms of the current agreement continue indefinitely until either party provides appropriate notice of intent to terminate the contract.\n(d)\nPrior to the Merger, Former Caesars provided more than\n5\n% of the total contributions for the plan year ended December 31, 2019.\n(e)\nThe Company provided more than\n5\n% of the total contributions for the plan year ended December 31, 2020 and as of the date the financial statements were issued, Forms 5500 were not available for the 2021 plan year.\n(f)\nThe HEREIU Pension Fund consists of two separate plans, the Legacy Plan of the HEREIU Pension Fund and the Adjustable Plan of the HEREIU Pension Fund. CEI makes a single contribution to the HEREIU Pension Fund, the Trustees of which allocate such contribution between the Legacy Plan and the Adjustable Plan. The contribution amount reflected to the Legacy Plan is the aggregate contribution made to the HEREIU Pension Fund before such allocation between the Legacy Plan and the Adjustable Plan of the HEREIU Pension Fund.\n(g)\nPlan years begin July 1.\n108\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nNote 17.\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of the Company’s provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented below.\nThe following is a reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the Company’s effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n109\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes. Significant components of the Company’s net deferred taxes at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nThe net deferred tax liabilities above are presented in the Balance Sheets as follows:\nAs a result of the Merger, the Company assumed $\n767\nmillion of additional net deferred tax liabilities, net of valuation allowances, plus $\n24\nmillion in additional accruals for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest. As a result of the William Hill Acquisition, the Company assumed $\n377\nmillion of additional net deferred tax liabilities net of valuation allowances, plus $\n34\nmillion in additional accruals for uncertain tax positions including accrued interest. Of the deferred tax liabilities and uncertain tax positions recorded due to the William Hill Acquisition, $\n132\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, respectively, have been presented in Liabilities related to assets held for sale.\nA valuation allowance is recognized if, based on the weight of available evidence, it is more-likely-than-not that some portion, or all, of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Management must analyze all available positive and negative evidence regarding realization of the deferred tax assets and make an assessment of the likelihood of sufficient future taxable income. We have provided a valuation allowance on certain federal, state, and foreign deferred tax assets that were not deemed realizable based upon estimates of future taxable income.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n2.4\nbillion and $\n9.4\nbillion, respectively. The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards include $\n450\nmillion and $\n2.2\nbillion, respectively, that do not expire. The remaining federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will begin to expire in 2032 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had federal general business tax credit and research tax credit carryforwards of $\n116\nmillion, which begin to expire in 2029.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n60\nmillion. The foreign net operating loss carryforwards include $\n58\nmillion that do not expire. The remaining $\n2\nmillion foreign net operating losses begin to expire in 2033.\n110\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nIn general, Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code provides an annual limitation with respect to the ability of a corporation to utilize its net operating loss carryovers, as well as certain built-in losses, against future taxable income in the event of a change in ownership. The Merger in July 2020 and the William Hill Acquisition in April 2021 resulted in a change in ownership for purposes of Section 382, making its provisions applicable to the Company. However, it is unlikely that the annual limitation on tax attribute usage resulting from the acquisition will adversely affect the Company’s ability to utilize its net operating loss carryovers against its future taxable income.\nWe classify reserves for tax uncertainties within Other long-term liabilities in our Balance Sheets, separate from any related income tax payable or Deferred income taxes. Included in the $\n157\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits as of the end of 2021 is $\n21\nmillion related to discontinued operations. Reserve amounts relate to any potential income tax liabilities resulting from uncertain tax positions as well as potential interest or penalties associated with those liabilities.\nWe accrue interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense. During 2021, we increased our accrual by $\n20\nmillion, primarily due to the William Hill Acquisition. During 2020, we increased our accrual by $\n137\nmillion, primarily as a result of the Merger. There was\nno\naccrual during 2019. There was an accrual for the payment of interest and penalties of $\n2\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Included in the balances of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $\n117\nmillion and $\n123\nmillion, respectively, of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate.\nThe Company, including its subsidiaries, files tax returns with federal, state and foreign jurisdictions. The Company does not have tax sharing agreements with the other members within the consolidated group. With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to US federal or state and local tax assessments by tax authorities for years before 2018. The tax years 2016 to 2021 remain subject to examination in Gibraltar and Malta. The tax years 2020 to 2021 remain subject to examination in the United Kingdom. We believe that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits liability will not materially change within the next 12 months. Audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. Although we believe that adequate provision has been made for such issues, there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on our earnings. Conversely, if these issues are resolved favorably in the future, the related provision would be reduced, thus having a favorable impact on earnings.\nNote 18.\nRelated Parties\nREI\nAs of December 31, 2021, Recreational Enterprises, Inc. (“REI”) owned approximately\n4.0\n% of outstanding common stock of the Company. The directors of REI are the Company’s Executive Chairman of the Board, Gary L.

Carano and Gene Carano, own the equity interests in REI. For each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were\nno\nrelated party transactions between the Company and the Carano family other than compensation, including salary and equity incentives and the CSY Lease listed below.\nC. S. & Y. Associates\nThe Company owns the entire parcel on which Eldorado Reno is located, except for approximately\n30,000\nsquare feet which is leased from C. S. & Y. Associates (“CSY”) which is an entity partially owned by REI (the “CSY Lease”). The CSY Lease expires on June 30, 2057. Annual rent pursuant to the CSY Lease is currently $\n0.6\nmillion, paid quarterly. Annual rent is subject to periodic rent escalations through the term of the lease. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 there were\nno\namounts due to or from CSY.\n111\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\nTransactions with Horseshoe Baltimore\nThe Company held an interest in Horseshoe Baltimore of approximately\n44.3\n%, which was accounted for as an equity method investment, prior to our acquisition of an additional interest and subsequent consolidation on August 26, 2021. These related party transactions included items such as casino management fees, reimbursement of various costs incurred on behalf of Horseshoe Baltimore, and the allocation of other general corporate expenses.\nTransactions with NeoGames\nThe Company holds an interest in NeoGames (see Note 5). NeoGames provides the player account management system to our wholly-owned Liberty platform. We have a dedicated team of programmers at NeoGames working on enhancements to our player account management system on our behalf, for which NeoGames is compensated under a services agreement.\nDue from/to Affiliates\nAmounts due from or to affiliates for each counterparty represent the net receivable or payable as of the end of the reporting period primarily resulting from the transactions described above and settled on a net basis by each counterparty in accordance with the legal and contractual restrictions governing transactions by and among the Company’s consolidated entities. As of December 31, 2020, Due from affiliates, net was $\n44\nmillion, and represented transactions with Horseshoe Baltimore and William Hill. Amounts due from/to William Hill and Horseshoe Baltimore eliminate upon consolidation. See Note 3.\nNote 19.\nSegment Information\nThe executive decision maker of the Company reviews operating results, assesses performance and makes decisions on a “significant market” basis. Management views each of the Company’s casinos as an operating segment. Operating segments are aggregated based on their similar economic characteristics, types of customers, types of services and products provided, and their management and reporting structure. Prior to the William Hill Acquisition, our principal operating activities occurred in\nthree\nregionally-focused reportable segments: Las Vegas, Regional, and Managed, International, CIE, in addition to Corporate and Other. Following the William Hill Acquisition, the Company’s principal operating activities occur in\nfour\nreportable segments. The reportable segments are based on the similar characteristics of the operating segments with the way management assesses these results and allocates resources, which is a consolidated view that adjusts for the effect of certain transactions between these reportable segments within Caesars: (1) Las Vegas, (2) Regional, (3) Caesars Digital, and (4) Managed and Branded, in addition to Corporate and Other. See table below for a summary of these segments. Also, see Note 4, Note 6 and Note 7 for a discussion of the impairment of intangibles and long-lived assets related to certain segments.\nThe following table sets forth certain information regarding our properties (listed by segment in which each property is reported) as of December 31, 2021:\n112\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n___________________\n(a)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, these properties were sold or held for sale.

The sale of Caesars UK Group closed on July 16, 2021, in which the buyer assumed all liabilities associated with the Caesars UK Group. Additionally, on September 8, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell William Hill International, which is expected to close in the second quarter of 2022.\nCertain of our properties operate off-track betting locations, including Harrah’s Hoosier Park Racing & Casino, which operates Winner’s Circle Indianapolis and Winner’s Circle New Haven; and Indiana Grand, which operates Winner’s Circle Clarksville. The LINQ Promenade, listed above in our Las Vegas segment, is an open-air dining, entertainment, and retail promenade located on the east side of the Las Vegas Strip next to The LINQ Hotel & Casino (the “LINQ”) that features the High Roller, a 550-foot observation wheel, and the Fly LINQ Zipline attraction.

We recast previously reported segment amounts to conform to the way management assesses results and allocates resources for the current year.\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA - By Segment to Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Caesars\nAdjusted EBITDA is presented as a measure of the Company’s performance. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as revenues less operating expenses and is comprised of net income (loss) before (i) interest expense, net of interest capitalized and interest income, (ii) income tax (benefit) provision, (iii) depreciation and amortization, and (iv) certain items that we do not consider indicative of our ongoing operating performance at an operating property level.\nIn evaluating Adjusted EBITDA you should be aware that, in the future, we may incur expenses that are the same or similar to some of the adjustments in this presentation. The presentation of Adjusted EBITDA should not be construed as an inference that future results will be unaffected by unusual or unexpected items.\nAdjusted EBITDA is a financial measure commonly used in our industry and should not be construed as an alternative to net income (loss) as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity (as determined in accordance with GAAP). Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies within the industry. Adjusted EBITDA is included because management uses Adjusted EBITDA to measure performance and allocate resources, and believes that Adjusted EBITDA provides investors with additional information consistent with that used by management.\n114\nCAESARS ENTERTAINMENT, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n____________________\n(a)\nOther income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily represents a loss on the change in fair value of investments held by the Company and a loss on the change in fair value of the derivative liability related to the\n5\n% Convertible Notes.\n(b)\nTransaction costs and other operating costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily represent costs related to the William Hill Acquisition and the Merger, various contract or license termination exit costs, professional services, other acquisition costs and severance costs.\n(c)\nOther items primarily represent certain consulting and legal fees, rent for non-operating assets, relocation expenses, retention bonuses, and business optimization expenses.\n___________________\n(a)\nIncludes $\n2\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion of capital expenditures related to properties classified as discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n115"

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe have established and maintain disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in our reports that we file under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and management necessarily is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures.\nWe carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer (principal executive officer) and Chief Financial Officer (principal financial officer), of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures (as defined under the Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report. Based on this evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report are effective to ensure that the information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, evaluated and reported within the time periods specified in SEC rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) or 15d-15(e) promulgated under the Exchange Act) for Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and its subsidiaries. This system is designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company’s management regarding the reliability of financial reporting and preparation of consolidated financial statements for external purposes.\nThe Company completed its acquisition of William Hill PLC on April 22, 2021. Accordingly, the acquired assets and liabilities of William Hill are included in our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and the results of its operations and cash flows are reported in our consolidated statement of operations and cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 from the date of acquisition. At the time that the William Hill Acquisition was consummated, the Company’s intent was to divest William Hill International. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of William Hill International are classified as held for sale with operations presented within discontinued operations. We are in the process of integrating policies, processes, information technology systems and other components of internal controls over financial reporting of the combined business. Management will continue to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting as we complete our integration. In accordance with SEC staff guidance permitting a company to exclude an acquired business from management’s assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting for the year in which the acquisition is completed, management has excluded William Hill from its internal control assessment. William Hill represents 14% of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.’s consolidated assets as of December 31, 2021, and 2% of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.’s net revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nManagement, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated and assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this Form 10-K Annual Report based upon the framework set forth in the Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organization of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation and assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has audited our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, as stated in its report which follows below.\n116\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nExcept as noted below, during the quarter ended December 31, 2021, there were no significant changes in our internal control over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nOn April 22, 2021, we completed the acquisition of William Hill PLC. See Item 8., “Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements”, Note 3, “Acquisitions, Purchase Price Accounting and Pro forma Information” for discussion of the acquisition and related financial data. The Company is in the process of integrating William Hill PLC into our internal controls over financial reporting. As a result of these integration activities, certain controls will be evaluated and may be changed.\nExcluding the William Hill Acquisition, there were no changes in our internal controls over financial reporting that have materially affected, or are reasonable likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\n117\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the stockholders and the Board of Directors of Caesars Entertainment, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Caesars Entertainment, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 23, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at William Hill PLC, which was acquired on April 22, 2021, and whose financial statements constitute 14% of the Company’s consolidated assets as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n, and 2% of the Company’s net revenues for the year\nended December 31, 2021\n. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at William Hill PLC.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nFebruary 23, 2022\n118"
