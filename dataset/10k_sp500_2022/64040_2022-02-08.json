    "text": "Overview\nS&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture. We serve our global customers through a broad range of products and services available through both third-party and proprietary distribution channels. We were incorporated in December of 1925 under the laws of the state of New York.\nOur Businesses\nOur operations consist of four reportable segments: S&P Global Ratings (\"Ratings\"), S&P Global Market Intelligence (\"Market Intelligence\"), S&P Global Platts (\"Platts\") and S&P Dow Jones Indices (\"Indices\"). For a discussion on the competitive conditions and regulatory environment associated with our businesses, see “MD&A – Segment Review” contained in Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMerger Agreement\nIn November of 2020, S&P Global and IHS Markit Ltd (\"IHS Markit\") entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, a subsidiary of S&P Global will merge with and into IHS Markit, with IHS Markit surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of S&P Global. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of IHS Markit issued and outstanding (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.2838 fully paid and nonassessable shares of S&P Global common stock (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, without interest), less any applicable withholding taxes. On March 11, 2021, S&P Global and IHS Markit shareholders voted to approve the merger agreement. As of December 31, 2021, IHS Markit had approximately 399.1 million shares outstanding. Subject to certain closing conditions, the merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.\nRatings\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.\nWith offices in over 25 countries around the world, Ratings is an important part of the world's financial infrastructure and has played a leading role for over 150 years in providing investors with information and independent benchmarks for their investment and financial decisions as well as access to the capital markets. The key constituents Ratings serves are investors, corporations, governments, municipalities, commercial and investment banks, insurance companies, asset managers, and other debt issuers.\nAs the capital markets continue to evolve, Ratings is well-positioned to capitalize on opportunities, driven by continuing regulatory changes, through its global network, well-established position in corporate markets and strong investor reputation.\nRatings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:\n•\nratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and\n•\nbank loan ratings.\nNon-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL.\n6\nTable of Contents\nMarket Intelligence\nMarket Intelligence's portfolio of capabilities are designed to help investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform evaluations and assess credit risk. Key customers served by Market Intelligence include investment managers, investment banks, private equity firms, insurance companies, commercial banks, corporations, professional services firms, government agencies and regulators.\nMarket Intelligence includes the following business lines:\n•\nDesktop\n—\na product suite that provides data, analytics and third-party research for global finance professionals, which includes the Market Intelligence Desktop (which are inclusive of the S&P Capital IQ and SNL Desktop products);\n•\nData Management Solutions\n—\nintegrated bulk data feeds and application programming interfaces that can be customized, which includes Compustat, GICS, Point In Time Financials; and\n•\nCredit Risk Solutions\n—\ncommercial arm that sells Ratings' credit ratings and related data, analytics and research, which includes subscription-based offerings, RatingsDirect® and RatingsXpress®; and Credit Analytics.\nSubscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, analytics, third-party research, and credit ratings-related information primarily through web-based channels, including Market Intelligence Desktop, RatingsDirect®, RatingsXpress®, and Credit Analytics. Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing and analytical services.\nPlatts\nPlatts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. Platts provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency. Key customers served by Platts include producers, traders and intermediaries within the energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture markets.\nPlatts' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue\n—\nprimarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products;\n•\nSales usage-based royalties\n—\nprimarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue\n—\nconference sponsorship, consulting engagements, and events.\nIndices\nIndices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of indices to meet an array of investor needs. Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.\nIndices derives revenue from asset-linked fees when investors direct funds into its proprietary designed or owned indexes, sales-usage royalties of its indices, and to a lesser extent data subscription arrangements. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:\n•\nInvestment vehicles\n—\nasset-linked fees such as exchange traded funds (“ETFs”)  and mutual funds, that are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;\n•\nExchange traded derivatives\n—\ngenerate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;\n•\nIndex-related licensing fees\n—\nfixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and\n•\nData and customized index subscription fees\n—\nfees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.\n7\nTable of Contents\nSegment and Geographic Data\nThe relative contribution of our reportable segments to operating revenue, operating profit, long-lived assets and geographic area for the three years ended December 31, 2021 are included in Note 12 –\nSegment and Geographic Information\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nHuman Capital\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 22,850 permanent employees located worldwide, including around 14,600 in Asia, 5,300 in the U.S., 2,150 in the European region, and 800 in the rest of the world.\nWe invest in our success as a global Company by investing in our employees across the world through our “people first” approach to human capital management, aimed at supporting everyone who works for us to reach their full potential.\nBoard Oversight & Management Implementation of Human Capital Strategy\nOur Board of Directors and Company management view effective human capital management as critical to the Company’s ability to execute its strategy.\nAs a result, the Board of Directors and the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee oversee and regularly engage with our CEO, Chief Purpose Officer, Chief Corporate Responsibility & Diversity Officer and other members of senior leadership on a broad range of people topics, including: culture and purpose; talent attraction and development; succession planning; compensation and benefits; diversity, equity and inclusion (\"DEI\"); workplace health, safety and well-being; and employee engagement and retention\n.\nAt the management level, our Chief Purpose Officer is responsible for leading the development and execution of the Company’s human capital management strategy, also referred to as our “People” strategy, working together with other senior leaders across the Company.  Among other things, this includes promoting an inclusive and performance-driven workplace culture with equitable opportunity for all; managing the Company’s initiatives to attract, develop, engage and retain the high-quality talent needed to ensure S&P Global is equipped with the right skillsets and intellectual capital to deliver on current and future business needs; and overseeing the design of the Company’s compensation, benefits and well-being programs. In connection with these responsibilities, the Chief Purpose Officer also partners with our Corporate Responsibility & Diversity, Equity & Inclusion team on the development and execution of the Company’s diversity, equity and inclusion roadmap and works closely with the CEO on executive succession planning and development of the talent succession pipeline for the Company’s Operating Committee.\nThe Company’s short-term incentive plan further reflects the significant role our people play in driving our enterprise strategy to Power the Markets of the Future by linking executive pay outcomes under our enterprise and division balanced scorecards to the achievement of strategic people priorities\n.\nIn 2021, we focused on delivering on the following strategic People priorities across the enterprise:\n•\nContinuing to foster a people first environment, while maintaining existing levels of engagement;\n8\nTable of Contents\n•\nEncouraging career mobility through career coaching, while attracting and retaining the best people; and\n•\nImproving diverse representation through talent acquisition, advancement and retention, while continuing to raise awareness of racial education.\nTo achieve our strategic people objectives, we support our employees through human capital management strategies that include diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives; learning and development programs; competitive compensation and benefits programs; workplace health, safety and well-being measures; and talent attraction, retention and engagement. Examples of some of our key initiatives and programs in these focus areas are included below.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nOur ability to attract and retain a diverse and inclusive workforce is critical to our long-term strategy, driving business growth and innovation and empowering our people to achieve their full potential. In connection with our commitment to create a diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace, we have taken the following steps to foster an environment where our people can bring their whole selves to work:\n•\nAn executive DEI Council, co-chaired by our CEO and Chief Purpose Officer, directs and oversees our enterprise-wide DEI strategy, advancing and ensuring coordination and accountability for DEI programs across the organization. In 2021, we also designed a new and improved DEI governance model for the larger combined organization following the close of the merger with IHS Markit to align on strategy and prioritization; improve connectivity and create a defined and well-coordinated feedback loop between the Company’s Board of Directors, the executive DEI Council, Employee Resource Groups and People leaders; and enhance accountability.\n•\nWe measure progress on our diversity, equity and inclusion programs as part of our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, which are reviewed by the CEO quarterly and the Board at least biannually, and impact short-term incentive compensation. Key Performance Indicators under our incentive scorecards for tracking and ensuring accountability for DEI progress include measuring the net change in the gender and racial/ethnic diversity of the S&P Global employee population and DEI specific sentiment through the annual VIBE employee engagement survey.\n•\nWe connect colleagues across our organization through our Employee Resource Groups. These global and employee-led networks offer career experiences and network-building opportunities that foster professional development and support workplace diversity.\n•\nTo improve our pipeline of diverse talent, we have expanded our partnerships in diverse talent recruitment with select Historically Black Colleges and Universities, upgraded interview training to incorporate awareness of unconscious bias, and expanded career mentoring and leadership development opportunities for diverse colleagues.\nLearning and Development Programs\nWe support our employees in pursuing their professional goals with growing investments in personalized development. We provide a wide array of global training and learning programs to help employees expand their knowledge, skills and experience and guide career advancement, including:\n•\nTechnology Training - We offer internal technology training programs to enhance the technology skills of our workforce and accelerate our ability to solve complex problems using a multidisciplinary blend of data inference, algorithm development and technology education for all employees.\n•\nCareer Coaching - We launched a career coaching program, offering customized support through global career coaches, to empower people to take ownership of their career and help them navigate their career path and opportunities to grow within S&P Global.\n•\nLeadership Development - We invest in developing leaders at all levels of our organization through targeted programs designed to foster leadership excellence in new people managers, develop emerging leaders and strengthen our executive talent bench, providing a robust internal succession pipeline for our Operating Committee.\nCompetitive Compensation and Benefits Programs\nWe believe compensation and benefits programs are critical to the overall employee experience. Offering market competitive, people-centric and performance-driven compensation and benefits is key to our recruitment, talent management and retention strategies. As a result, management regularly assesses employee feedback, competitor research and market data to ensure our programs remain competitive and are designed with our people’s physical, financial, work-life, mental and emotional health and\n9\nTable of Contents\nwell-being in mind. Based on these insights, each year we continue to introduce new and enhanced “people first” benefits to  advance employees’ well-being at work and beyond in support of our “people first” philosophy. In 2021, we launched new initiatives to increase transparency around pay decisions and empower colleagues to initiate pay conversations and to enhance well-being support for our people by providing extended parental leave, more flexible time-off arrangements and wellness days.\nWorkplace Health, Safety and Well-being\nThe health, safety and well-being of our people working around the globe is a top priority, and our facilities worldwide follow rigorous, internally and externally audited, occupational health and safety policies.\nAt the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, we established a steering committee to lead a coordinated workplace safety strategy and acted quickly implementing significant changes across the organization to protect our people and the communities in which we operate. In early 2021, most of our employees remained working from home and our plans to introduce a new flexible return to office model and phased approach to office re-openings evolved in response to changing dynamics throughout the year. Informed by guidance from our Chief Medical Officer and close partnership between Global Security and local site leaders to propose changes as needed, we continued to promote health, safety and well-being by providing updated guidance, expanded benefits and support services to help our people navigate remote work and the ongoing pandemic, including:\n•\n30 business days global care leave while caring for a sick or healthy family member during COVID-19 and mandated work from home guidance;\n•\n10 paid business days minimum global sick leave while being treated for COVID-19;\n•\nunlimited paid compassion leave following loss of a loved one;\n•\nthree months’ pay to family members following loss of an employee;\n•\nflexible arrangements for those working from home while caring for family;\n•\nexpanded telemedicine resources and mental health support services; and\n•\ntownhalls and a dedicated microsite to provide ongoing guidance and support for homeworking logistics.\nRetention and Engagement\nIn order to attract and retain the high-quality talent needed to execute our long-term strategy to Power the Markets of the Future, we believe it is critical for our people to feel motivated and empowered. As a result, we strive to create a unified and inclusive workplace culture that promotes employee engagement, satisfaction and performance; and that reflects our common corporate purpose and values.\nWe invite employee feedback through a variety of channels for open communication and engagement, including small group employee round-table discussions with our business leaders and members of our Board of Directors, our annual VIBE employee engagement survey, as well as more frequent check-ins through employee “Pulse” surveys. The annual VIBE survey allows us to track progress in critical areas, such as workplace pride and satisfaction and inclusive culture, and gather actionable insights for improvements to our people strategy. We encourage managers to share VIBE survey results with their teams, prioritize action areas and pursue solutions. To reinforce management accountability, we also track employee survey scores in our enterprise and division balanced scorecards, with outcomes against survey engagement targets impacting short-term incentive outcomes.\nAvailable Information\nS&P Global's investor relations website provides access to Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Proxy Statements, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, earnings releases and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

    "text": "The following risk factors and other information included in this annual report on Form 10-K should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face. These risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or which we currently believe to be immaterial may also impair our business operations.\nWe operate in the capital and commodities markets. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms, and issuers; the commodities markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture. Certain risk factors are applicable to certain of our individual segments while other risk factors are applicable Company-wide.\nMerger Risks\nThe Merger is subject to conditions, some of which may not be satisfied, or completed on a timely basis, if at all. Failure to complete, or unexpected delays in completing, the Merger or any termination of the Merger Agreement could have material adverse effects on us.\nOn November 29, 2020, we, our wholly-owned subsidiary, Sapphire Subsidiary, Ltd., a Bermuda exempted company limited by shares ( “Merger Sub”), and IHS Markit, entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (as amended on January 20, 2021, the “Merger Agreement”), pursuant to which Merger Sub will merge with and into IHS Markit, with IHS Markit surviving such merger as our wholly-owned, direct subsidiary. The completion of the Merger is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, as well as the accuracy of all representations and warranties of IHS Markit and the absence of a material adverse effect since the date of the Merger Agreement, which make the completion and timing of the Merger uncertain. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of the Merger for a significant period of time or prevent it from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of the Merger will be satisfied or waived or that the Merger will be completed.\nIn addition, either S&P Global or IHS Markit may terminate the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, including if the Merger is not completed by the outside date determined pursuant to the Merger Agreement, which is May 29, 2022. In certain circumstances, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, S&P Global would be required to pay a termination fee of $2.380 billion to IHS Markit, and in certain circumstances, IHS Markit would be required to pay a termination fee of $1.075 billion to S&P Global, upon termination of the Merger Agreement, each as contemplated by the Merger Agreement.\nMoreover, at any time before or after the completion of the Merger, and notwithstanding the termination of applicable waiting periods, the applicable U.S. or foreign regulatory authorities or any state attorney general could take such action under antitrust or other applicable laws as such party deems necessary or desirable in the public interest. Such action could include, among other things, seeking to enjoin the completion of the Merger or seeking divestiture of substantial assets of the parties.\nIn response to feedback from U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities, we and IHS Markit have agreed to divest certain businesses in order to procure regulatory approval of the Merger. On July 31, 2021, S&P Global, IHS Markit and News Corporation entered into a stock and asset purchase agreement, pursuant to which IHS Markit will sell all right, title and interest to certain of its pricing information businesses, including its Oil Price Information Services (OPIS), Coal, Metals and Mining, and PetroChem Wire businesses, to News Corporation for a purchase price of $1.15 billion. On December 27, 2021, S&P Global and IHS Markit announced agreements to sell IHS Markit’s Base Chemicals business to News Corporation for $295 million, and S&P Global’s CUSIP Global Services business to FactSet Research Systems for $1.925 billion.  S&P Global has also committed to divest its Leveraged Commentary and Data (LCD) business, together with a related family of leveraged loan indices, in connection with a conditional approval for the Merger from the European Commission.  The completion of each of these divestiture transactions is subject to a number of conditions, including, among other things, the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, which make the completion and timing of these transactions uncertain. The failure to satisfy all of the required conditions could delay the completion of these transactions for a significant period of time or prevent each from occurring at all. There can be no assurance that the conditions to the completion of any of these transactions will be satisfied or waived or that these transactions will be completed (and, if such transactions are not completed, it may materially adversely affect the completion of the Merger).\nIf the Merger is not completed, we may be materially adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed the Merger, will be subject to a number of risks, including the following: the market price of our common stock could decline; if the Merger Agreement is terminated, we will not realize the benefit of the time and resources, financial and otherwise, committed by our management to matters relating to the Merger that could have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities; we may experience negative reactions from the financial markets or from their respective customers, suppliers or employees; and we will be required to pay our expenses relating to the Merger, such as legal, accounting and financial advisory fees, whether or not the Merger is completed.\n11\nTable of Contents\nIn addition, if the Merger is not completed, we could be subject to litigation related to any failure to complete the Merger or related to any enforcement proceeding commenced against such party to perform its obligations under the Merger Agreement. Any of these risks could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock. Similarly, delays in the completion of the Merger could, among other things, result in additional transaction costs, loss of revenue or other negative effects associated with delay and uncertainty about completion of the merger and could materially and adversely impact our ongoing business, financial condition, results of operations and the market price of our common stock.\nWe are subject to business uncertainties and contractual restrictions while the Merger and related divestitures are pending, which could adversely affect our business and operations.\nIn connection with the pendency of the Merger and related divestitures, it is possible that some customers, suppliers, partners and other persons with whom we have a business relationship may delay or defer certain business decisions or might decide to seek to terminate, change or renegotiate their relationships with us as a result of the Merger, a divestiture or otherwise, which could negatively affect our revenue, earnings and/or cash flow, as well as the market price of our common stock, regardless of whether the Merger or any such divestiture is completed. In addition, under the terms of the Merger Agreement, we are subject to certain restrictions on the conduct of our business prior to completing the Merger, which may adversely affect our ability to execute certain of our business strategies, including the ability in certain cases to acquire or dispose of assets or pay dividends or incur capital expenditures above a certain amount. Such limitations could adversely our business and operations prior to the completion of the Merger.\nWe may be unable to successfully integrate the businesses of S&P Global and IHS Markit or realize the anticipated benefits of the Merger.\nThe success of the Merger will depend, in part, on our ability to successfully combine and integrate our existing business with that of IHS Markit, and realize the anticipated benefits, including synergies, cost savings, innovation and technological opportunities and operational efficiencies from the Merger in a manner that does not materially disrupt existing customer, supplier and employee relations and does not result in decreased revenues due to losses of, or decreases in demand by, customers. Our ability to realize these anticipated benefits is subject to certain risks, including whether we will perform as expected, the possibility that we paid more for IHS Markit than the value we will derive from the Merger and the assumption of known and unknown liabilities of IHS Markit. If we are unable to achieve these objectives within the anticipated time frame, or at all, the anticipated benefits may not be realized fully or at all, or may take longer to realize than expected, and the value of our common stock may decline. We may fail to realize some or all of the anticipated benefits of the Merger if the integration process takes longer than expected or is more costly than expected.\nThe integration of the two companies may result in material challenges, including: managing a larger, more complex combined business; maintaining employee morale and retaining key management and other employees; retaining existing business and operational relationships, including customers, suppliers and employees and other counterparties, as may be impacted by contracts containing consent and/or other provisions that may be triggered by the merger, and attracting new business and operational relationships; consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures and eliminating duplicative operations, including unanticipated issues in integrating financial reporting, information technology infrastructure, data and content management systems and product platforms, communications and other systems; coordinating geographically separate organizations, including consolidating offices of S&P Global and IHS Markit that are currently in or near the same location; harmonizing both companies’ corporate cultures, operating practices, employee development and compensation programs, internal controls, compliance programs and other policies, procedures and processes; addressing possible differences in business backgrounds, and management philosophies; managing the impact of divestitures; and unforeseen expenses or delays associated with the Merger (which has already been delayed beyond our initial expectations of closing in 2021).\nMany of these factors will be outside of our control, and any one of them could result in delays, increased costs, decreases in the amount of expected revenues and other adverse impacts, which could materially affect the combined company’s business, financial condition and results of operations. Due to legal restrictions, S&P Global and IHS Markit are currently permitted to conduct only limited planning for the integration of the two companies following the Merger. The actual integration may result in additional and unforeseen expenses, and the anticipated benefits of the integration plan may not be realized on a timely basis, if at all.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses and devote significant resources in connection with the completion of the Merger and related divestitures, and the integration of the businesses of S&P Global and IHS Markit.\nWe expect to incur substantial expenses, and devote significant resources, in connection with the completion of the Merger and related divestitures, and the integration of a large number of processes, policies, procedures, operations, technologies and systems of S&P Global and IHS Markit in connection with the Merger. The management of the combined company may face significant challenges in implementing such integration, many of which may be beyond the control of management and which may result in increased costs and diversion of management’s time and energy, as well as materially adversely impact the\n12\nTable of Contents\nanticipated synergies of the Merger and the business, financial condition and results of operations of the combined company. The integration process and other disruptions, including increased cyber security risk, resulting from the Merger may also adversely affect the combined company’s relationships with employees, suppliers, customers, distributors and others with whom S&P Global and IHS Markit have business or other dealings, and difficulties in integrating the businesses of S&P Global and IHS Markit could harm the reputation of the combined company.\nThese incremental transaction-related costs may exceed the savings the combined company expects to achieve from the elimination of duplicative costs and the realization of other efficiencies related to the integration of the businesses, particularly in the near term and in the event there are material unanticipated costs. Factors beyond the parties’ control could affect the total amount or timing of these expenses, many of which, by their nature, are difficult to estimate accurately. Some of these expenses have already been incurred or may be incurred regardless of whether the Merger is completed.\nIf the Merger is completed, our shareholders’ ownership percentage will be diluted.\nIf the Merger is completed, we will issue to IHS Markit shareholders shares of our common stock. As a result of the issuance of these shares of our common stock, our shareholders will own a smaller percentage of the combined company after the Merger and will therefore have a reduced voting interest.\nDuring the pendency of the Merger, our ability to execute share repurchases will be restricted.\nWhile the Merger is pending, we will have limited opportunities to launch repurchase programs and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to successfully execute a repurchase program when a window of opportunity presents itself.\nCOVID-19 Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects have affected, and may have a material adverse effect on, our results of operations.\nFollowing the outbreak of an infectious respiratory illness caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”), the World Health Organization declared a global emergency on January 30, 2020 and subsequently declared COVID-19 as a pandemic on March 11, 2020.\nCOVID-19 has spread globally, including in the United States, the United Kingdom, the European Union and other jurisdictions in which we operate. Governments across the world have taken steps to contain the virus by restricting human movement through numerous measures including travel bans and restrictions, social distancing, quarantines, shelter in place orders, enhanced health screenings at ports of entry and elsewhere, and business shutdowns, including those in response to the outbreaks of the Delta variant in the second and third quarters of 2021 and the Omicron variant in the fourth quarter of 2021. Continuation of the shutdown of businesses and entire industries, increases in unemployment, implementation of furloughs, lost wages across populations and a significant drop in consumer and business spending, resulted in a recession in the United States during 2020. While vaccines have become available, their availability and their efficacy against the Omicron variant and possible future variants are uncertain, so it remains difficult to ascertain how COVID-19 will impact economic activity.  There are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance as to the effect of the COVID-19 global pandemic, and, as a result, the ultimate impact of the coronavirus outbreak or a similar health epidemic is uncertain. The effects of COVID-19 have impacted our operations and may ultimately have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in the future. The extent to which the pandemic will continue to affect our businesses, financial condition and results of operations will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted.\nIncreased volatility and uncertainty in the global economy, and the financial and commodities markets\nThe global economy has been disrupted as a result of the ongoing health crisis and the financial and commodities markets have reacted with unprecedented volatility. Governmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth. The success of these measures is unknown, and they may not be sufficient to address the market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity. Our businesses would be materially and adversely affected in the event of prolonged recessions in the U.S. and other major markets. Because there are no comparable recent events that can provide guidance on the impact to the global economy, we cannot predict the extent to which our business may be impacted. Moreover, the unprecedented volatility observed in the markets since the outset of COVID-19 may result in sudden unexpected changes in market structures that were not previously anticipated by laws, rules, regulations or general market practices. Risks posed to our businesses, financial condition and results of operations from volatility in the financial and commodities markets are described in the risk factor below entitled, “Changes in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations”.\n13\nTable of Contents\nDecreased demand for our subscription services\nOur clients are being impacted to varying degrees. Some may no longer be in business by the time the COVID-19 pandemic comes to an end, others will face significant spending constraints in order to continue to operate, and others may reduce their workforces permanently. As a result of the impact on our clients, our subscription services may face pricing pressure on renewals, delayed renewals, and challenges to new sales which would in turn reduce revenue, ultimately impacting our results of operations. The pandemic has impacted human mobility and, among other things, has impacted the supply and demand for energy used in transportation, which is also impacted by political tensions between large oil producing countries.\nThis uncertainty could put pressure on Platts clients and translate into slower demand for our subscription and related products and services. Moreover, while our business continuity program has been effective to date, the current restrictions on human mobility limit our ability to interact with subscribers and effectively demonstrate new products and may have a negative effect on our ability to secure new subscriptions and renewals.\nOur businesses assess and analyze the impact of economic events\nOur divisions are all actively engaged in analyzing and providing views on the quickly evolving economic conditions. We are publishing articles and research pieces that attempt to assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the world economy and its components, both geographic and sectoral. In addition, we are taking actions (including, but not limited to, rating actions, revising the composition of our indices, etc.), consistent with our business procedures, in response to the evolving conditions. Notwithstanding the care we take in carrying out our work, the views and assumptions we express, the conclusions we draw, the actions we take, and the work our divisions are producing today are likely to be heavily scrutinized with the benefit of hindsight. We have faced significant regulatory and media scrutiny following prior periods of volatility and economic uncertainty. Such scrutiny has in the past and may in the future impact our reputation, brand and credibility and result in government and regulatory proceedings, investigations, inquiries and litigation. See the below risk factors entitled “Exposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations” and “Our reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace”.\nBusiness continuity\nOur business continuity program has been effective to date. Since mid-March 2020, nearly our entire employee population has been working remotely. While we have been able to continue our operations during this time, maintaining a remote work environment for an extended period of time may have a material adverse effect on our productivity and our ability to meet the needs of our clients and exposes us to operational risks. See the below risk factor entitled “Our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability”.  Moreover, given the extent to which we are utilizing a remote working environment, we face increased vulnerability. Although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, we have noted an increase in cyber threats targeted at our remote work environment and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future. See the below risk factor entitled “We are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information”. In addition, while our employee base currently has adequate resources to pursue new clients or expand existing relationships, we have no control over the business continuity resources available to our clients. As a result, our ability to maintain, expand, or establish new client relationships may be limited.\nBusiness, Operational and Regulatory Risks\nChanges in the volume of securities issued and traded in domestic and/or global capital markets, asset levels and flows into investment products, changes in interest rates and volatility in the financial markets, and volatility in the commodities markets impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nOur business is impacted by general economic conditions and volatility in the U.S. and world financial markets.\n•\nEconomic conditions and volatility across the globe are generally affected by negative or uncertain economic and political conditions. In addition, natural and man-made disasters as well as the outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases introduce volatility and uncertainty into the global capital and commodities markets and negatively impact general economic conditions. Volatile, negative or uncertain economic and political conditions in our significant markets have undermined and could in the future undermine business confidence in our significant markets or in other markets, which are increasingly interdependent. Because we operate globally and have significant businesses in many markets, increased volatility or an economic slowdown in any of those markets could adversely affect our results of operations.\n•\nSince a significant component of our credit-rating based revenue is transaction-based, and is essentially dependent on the number and dollar volume of debt securities issued in the capital markets, unfavorable financial or economic conditions that either reduce investor demand for debt securities or reduce issuers’ willingness or ability to issue such securities tend to reduce the number and dollar volume of debt issuances for which Ratings provides credit ratings.\n•\nOur Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among\n14\nTable of Contents\nother factors, may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.\n•\nIncreases in interest rates or credit spreads, volatility in financial markets or the interest rate environment, significant political or economic events, defaults of significant issuers and other market and economic factors may negatively impact the general level of debt issuance, the debt issuance plans of certain categories of borrowers, the level of derivatives trading and/or the types of credit-sensitive products being offered, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nOur Platts business is impacted by volatility in the commodities markets. Weak economic conditions, especially in our key markets, including the energy industry, could reduce demand for our products, impacting our revenues and margins. As a result of volatility in commodity prices and trading activity in physical commodities and commodities derivatives, we may encounter difficulty in achieving sustained market acceptance of past or future contract terms, which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nAny weakness in the macroeconomic environment could constrain customer budgets across the markets we serve, potentially leading to a reduction in their employee headcount and a decrease in demand for our subscription-based products.\n•\nThe foregoing factors generally affect our performance and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks related to cybersecurity and protection of confidential information.\n•\nOur operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive and other types of data and information in our computer systems and networks and those of our third-party vendors.\n•\nAll of our businesses have access to material non-public information concerning the Company’s customers, including sovereigns, corporate issuers and other third parties around the world, the unauthorized disclosure of which could affect the trading markets for such customers’ securities and could damage such customers’ competitive positions. The cyber risks the Company faces range from cyber attacks common to most industries, to more sophisticated and targeted attacks, some of which may be carried out by state-sponsored actors, intended to obtain unauthorized access to certain information or systems due in part to our prominence in the global marketplace, such as our ratings on debt issued by sovereigns and corporate issuers, or the composition of our indices. Unauthorized disclosure of this information could cause our customers to lose faith in our ability to protect their confidential information and therefore cause customers to cease doing business with us.\n•\nWe experience cyber attacks and data breaches of varying degrees on a regular basis. Although there has not been a cyber attack that has had a material adverse effect on the Company to date, there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future.\n•\nWe are regularly exposed to vulnerabilities in widely deployed third-party software we deploy in the ordinary course of business, such as the recently identified Log4J vulnerability.  While such vulnerability did not result in a material adverse effect on the Company, it and similar incidents require the us to devote time and resources to remediation on a regular basis.  Notwithstanding our efforts, there can be no assurance that we will not suffer a material adverse effect resulting from vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.\n•\nBreaches of our or our vendors’ systems and networks, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber attacks, hacking, computer viruses or malware, employee error, malfeasance, physical breaches or other actions, may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such vendors’ websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information regarding us, our business or our customers. In the ordinary course, our third-parties, including our vendors, are subject to various forms of cyber attacks. To date, such attacks have not resulted in a material adverse impact to our business or operations, but there can be no guarantee we will not experience such an impact.\n•\nMisappropriation, improper modification, destruction, corruption or unavailability of our data and information due to cyber incidents, attacks or other security breaches could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and regulatory actions, and lead to loss of customer confidence in our security measures and reliability, which would harm our ability to retain customers and gain new ones.\n•\nAlthough we devote significant resources to maintain and regularly update our systems and processes that are designed to protect the security of our computer systems, software, networks and other technology assets and the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information belonging to the enterprise and our customers, clients and employees, there is no assurance that all of our security measures will provide absolute security.\n•\nMeasures that we take to avoid or mitigate material incidents can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or become obsolete. While we have not experienced a material incident to date, any material incident could cause us to experience reputational harm, loss of customers, regulatory actions, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by us, and increased expenses related to addressing or mitigating the risks associated with any such material incidents.\n•\nCyber threats are rapidly evolving and are becoming increasingly sophisticated and include denial of service attacks, ransomware, phishing attacks and payment fraud. Despite our efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems, as cyber threats evolve and become more difficult to detect and successfully defend against, one or more cyber threats might defeat the measures that we or our vendors take to anticipate, detect, avoid or mitigate such threats. Certain techniques\n15\nTable of Contents\nused to obtain unauthorized access, introduce malicious software, disable or degrade service, or sabotage systems may be designed to remain dormant until a triggering event and we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures since techniques change frequently or are not recognized until launched.\n•\nGiven the extent to which our businesses are privy to material non-public information concerning our customers, our data could be improperly used, including for insider trading by our employees and third party vendors with access to key systems. We have experienced insider trading incidents involving employees in the past, and it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third party vendors. We take precautions to detect and prevent such activity, including implementing and training on insider trading policies for our employees and contractual obligations for our third party vendors, but such precautions are not guaranteed to deter misconduct. Any breach of our clients’ confidences as a result of employee or third party vendor misconduct could harm our reputation.\n•\nThe theft, loss, or misuse of personal data collected, used, stored, or transferred by us to run our business could result in significantly increased security costs or costs related to defending legal claims.\n•\nAn actual or perceived breach of our security may harm the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures and result in damage to our reputation and a loss of confidence in the security of our products and services. Media or other reports of existing or perceived security vulnerabilities in our systems or those of our third-party business partners or service providers can also adversely impact our brand and reputation and materially impact our business.\n•\nAny of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nChanges in the legislative, regulatory, and commercial environments in which we operate may materially and adversely impact our ability to collect, compile, use, and publish data and may impact our financial results.\n•\nGlobal privacy, data localization and data protection legislation, enforcement, and policy activity in this area are rapidly expanding and creating a complex regulatory compliance environment. Costs to comply with and implement these privacy-related and data protection measures could be significant. In addition, an inadvertent failure to comply with federal, state, or international privacy-related or data protection laws and regulations despite our best efforts could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities or others.\n•\nCertain types of information we collect, compile, use, and publish, including offerings in all our businesses, and particularly our Market Intelligence business, are subject to regulation by governmental authorities in jurisdictions in which we operate. In addition, there is increasing concern among certain privacy and data protection advocates and government regulators regarding marketing and privacy matters as well as data protection, particularly as they relate to individual privacy and perceived national security interests.\n•\nThere has been increased public attention regarding the use of personal information and data transfer, accompanied by legislation and regulations intended to strengthen data protection, information security and consumer and personal privacy. The law in these areas continues to develop and the changing nature of privacy and data protection laws in the U.S., the European Union (“EU”) and elsewhere could impact our processing of personal and sensitive information of our employees, vendors and customers and other data.\n•\nFailure to comply with these requirements could result in significant penalties. The EU’s comprehensive General Data Privacy Regulation (“GDPR”), for example, provides for penalties of up to 4% of worldwide revenue, although the market is yet to see a penalty at the very top end of this range. Such laws and regulations, as well as any associated inquiries or investigations or any other government actions, may also be costly to comply with, result in negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject us to remedies that may harm our business, including fines or demands or orders that we modify or cease existing business practices.\n•\nOur reputation and brand and our ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if we fail, or are perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of our or third party’s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.\n•\nWe devote meaningful time and financial resources to compliance with current and future applicable international and U.S. privacy, cybersecurity, data protection and related laws. We have made capital investments and other expenditures to address cybersecurity preparedness and prevent future breaches, including costs associated with additional security technologies, personnel, experts and credit monitoring services for those whose data has been breached, but there can be no assurance that we will not need to make significant additional expenditures. These costs, which could be material, could adversely impact our results of operations in the period in which they are incurred and may not meaningfully limit the success of future attempts to breach our information technology systems.\n•\nIn addition, the EU and other jurisdictions, including the People’s Republic of China, are considering imposing or have already imposed additional restrictions, including in relation to cross-border transfers of personal and other types of data. These requirements are increasing in complexity and number, change frequently and increasingly conflict among the various countries in which we operate, which could result in greater compliance risk and cost for us.\n•\nContinued privacy and data protection concerns may result in new or amended laws and regulations. Future laws and regulations with respect to the collection, compilation, use, and publication of information and consumer privacy could result in limitations on our operations, increased compliance or litigation expense, adverse publicity, or loss of revenue, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. It is also possible that we could be prohibited from collecting or disseminating certain types of data, which could affect our ability to meet our customers’ needs.\n16\nTable of Contents\n•\nWe may also from time to time be subject to, or face assertions that we are subject to, additional obligations relating to personal and other data by contract or due to assertions that self-regulatory obligations or industry standards apply to our practices.\nExposure to litigation and government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn the normal course of business, both in the United States and abroad, we and our subsidiaries are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries, as discussed under Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K and in Note 13 -\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8,\nConsolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and we face the risk that additional proceedings, investigations and inquiries will arise in the future.\n•\nMany of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the activity of our Ratings, Indices, and Platts businesses. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to our regulated activities and antitrust matters.\n•\nAny of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of the matters we are currently facing or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that the outcome of the matters we are currently facing or that we may face in the future will not have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nAs litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we continuously review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business and competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n•\nLegal proceedings impose additional expenses on the Company and require the attention of senior management to an extent that may significantly reduce their ability to devote time addressing other business issues.\n•\nRisks relating to legal proceedings may be heightened in foreign jurisdictions that lack the legal protections or liability standards comparable to those that exist in the United States. In addition, new laws and regulations have been and may continue to be enacted that establish lower liability standards, shift the burden of proof or relax pleading requirements, thereby increasing the risk of successful litigations against the Company in the United States and in foreign jurisdictions. These litigation risks are often difficult to assess or quantify and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nWe may not have adequate insurance or reserves to cover these risks, and the existence and magnitude of these risks often remains unknown for substantial periods of time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreasing regulation of our Ratings business in the United States, Europe and elsewhere can increase our costs of doing business and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe financial services industry is highly regulated, rapidly evolving and subject to the potential for increasing regulation in the United States, Europe and elsewhere. The businesses conducted by Ratings are in certain cases regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd-Frank Act”), the U.S. Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”), and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business.\n•\nIn the past several years, the U.S. Congress, the International Organization of Securities Commissions (\"IOSCO\"), the SEC, the European Commission, including through the European Securities Market Authority (\"ESMA\") and the UK Financial Conduct Authority (“FCA”), as well as regulators in other countries in which Ratings operates, have been reviewing the role of rating agencies and their processes and the need for greater oversight or regulations concerning the issuance of credit ratings or the activities of credit rating agencies. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies.\n•\nThese laws and regulations, and any future rule-making, could result in reduced demand for credit ratings and increased costs, which we may be unable to pass through to customers. In addition, there may be uncertainty over the scope, interpretation and administration of such laws and regulations. We may be required to incur significant expenses and/or take actions inconsistent with our business objectives in order to comply with such laws and regulations and to mitigate the risk of fines, penalties or other sanctions. Legal proceedings could become increasingly lengthy and there may be uncertainty over and exposure to liability. It is difficult to accurately assess the future impact\n17\nTable of Contents\nof legislative and regulatory requirements on our business and our customers’ businesses, and they may affect Ratings’ communications with issuers as part of the rating assignment process, alter the manner in which Ratings’ ratings are developed, affect the manner in which Ratings or its customers or users of credit ratings operate, impact the demand for ratings and alter the economics of the credit ratings business. Each of these developments increases the costs and legal risk associated with the issuance of credit ratings and may have a material adverse effect on our operations, profitability and competitiveness, the demand for credit ratings and the manner in which such ratings are utilized.\n•\nAdditional information regarding rating agencies is provided under Item 7,\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur Indices and Platts businesses are subject to new and evolving regulatory regimes in Europe and the potential for increased or changing regulations in the United States and elsewhere. Our Indices business is subject to a new regulatory regime in Australia. Our Indices and Platts businesses are subject to additional regulation in Europe. This changing regulatory landscape can increase our exposure, compliance risk and costs of doing business globally and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn addition to the extensive and evolving U.S. laws and regulations, foreign jurisdictions have taken measures to increase regulation of the financial services and commodities industries.\n•\nIn October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which IOSCO states are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments that are referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has taken steps to align its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.\n•\nIn July of 2013, IOSCO issued its Principles for Financial Benchmarks (\"Financial Benchmark Principles\"), which are intended to promote the reliability of the benchmark determination process by setting standards related to benchmark governance, benchmark quality, transparency and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices and benchmarks published by Indices. Indices has taken steps to align its governance regime, control framework and operations with the Financial Benchmark Principles and engages an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of its adherence to the Financial Benchmark Principles.\n•\nThe benchmark industry is subject to regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) as well as the evolving regulation of financial and commodity benchmarks in other jurisdictions. The EU Benchmark Regulation was published on June 30, 2016, with provisions applicable to Indices and Platts, effective from January 1, 2018. ESMA published additional guidance clarifying that existing benchmark administrators such as Platts could utilize the transitional provisions contained in the EU Benchmark Regulation, which provided them two (2) years to implement and seek authorization by an EU National Competent Authority by January 1, 2020, with their respective benchmark activities in Europe. Indices and Platts are now both supervised by the\nNetherlands Authority for the Financial Markets.\nThis legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations, greater compliance risk and costs for Indices and Platts but they are not expected to be material at this time.\n•\nIndices is subject to the benchmark regulation in Australia under which it is required to obtain a license from and be subject to the supervision of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission regarding its administration of the S&P ASX 200 index. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations, greater compliance risk and costs for Indices but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.\n•\nThe EU's package of legislative measures called the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and Regulation (collectively \"MiFID II\") entered into force in 2014, revising and updating the prior Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (2004) and its associated secondary legislation. The substantive provisions of MiFID II apply in all EU Member States since 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) mandate conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks for the purposes of clearing related securities and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses for this purpose; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venues that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research from other services, including execution services, and direct that investment firms must pay for research either out of a dedicated research payment account which is paid for by clients or from the investment firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the EU Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011, or EMIR). The MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts license their indices and price assessments, respectively, and could also have an indirect impact on the credit ratings and third-party research products offered by other divisions of the Company for use within the EU. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (“MAR”) may impose additional regulatory burdens on the activities of S&P Dow Jones Indices and Platts in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known.\nOur international business activities must comport with U.S. international trade restraints, including economic sanctions regulations administered by the U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Controls.\n18\nTable of Contents\n•\nAs a global company headquartered in the U.S., we are subject to U.S. laws and regulations, including economic sanction laws. These laws include prohibitions or restrictions on the sale or supply of certain products and services to embargoed or sanctioned countries, regions, governments, persons and entities.\n•\nEmbargoes and sanctions laws are changing rapidly for certain geographies, including with respect to Iran, Russia, and Venezuela. These embargoes and sanctions laws may affect our ability to continue to market and/or sell our products and services into these geographies and in turn adversely impact our revenue from such geographies.\n•\nAdditional international trade restraints may be promulgated at any time and may require changes to our operations and increase our risk of noncompliance.\n•\nFailure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in significant fines and penalties and related material adverse effects on our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur acquisitions and other strategic transactions may not produce anticipated results.\n•\nIn addition to the Merger, we have made and expect to continue to make acquisitions or enter into other strategic transactions to strengthen our business and grow our Company. Such transactions present significant challenges and risks, as the market for acquisitions and other strategic transactions is highly competitive, especially in light of industry consolidation, which may affect our ability to complete such transactions.\n•\nIf we are unsuccessful in completing such transactions or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\n•\nIf such transactions are completed, the anticipated growth and other strategic objectives of such transactions may not be fully realized or may take longer to realize than expected, and a variety of factors may adversely affect any anticipated benefits from such transactions. For instance, the process of integration may require more resources than anticipated, we may assume unintended liabilities, there may be unexpected regulatory and operating difficulties and expenditures, we may fail to retain key personnel of the acquired business and such transactions may divert management’s focus from other business operations.\n•\nThe failure of acquisitions and other strategic transactions to perform as expected could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe may become subject to liability based on the use of our products by our clients.\n•\nSome of our products support the investment processes and other activities of our clients, which, in the aggregate, manage trillions of dollars of assets. Use of our products as part of such activities, including the investment process, creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us for very significant dollar amounts, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe products we develop or license, and the proprietary methodologies, models and processes on which these products rely, may contain undetected errors or defects, despite testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Such errors may exist during any part of a product’s life cycle and may persist notwithstanding testing and/or other quality assurance practices. Ineffective or insufficient collaboration within the Company increases the risk that such errors may not be detected. Deploying products containing such errors may damage our reputation, and the costs associated with remediating such errors may have an impact on our profitability.\n•\nAny claim relating to our products, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would involve a significant commitment of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation. In addition, such claims and lawsuits could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIncreased competition could result in a loss of market share or revenue.\n•\nThe markets for credit ratings, financial research, market data, index-based products, and commodities price assessments and related news and information about these markets are intensely competitive. Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices compete domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of their offerings, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and technological innovation.\n•\nWhile our businesses face competition from traditional content and analytics providers (including exchanges), we also face competition from non-traditional providers, such as asset managers, investment banks and technology-led companies that are adding content and analytics capabilities to their core businesses.\n•\nIn addition, in some of the countries in which Ratings competes, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies and may from time to time establish official credit rating agencies, credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers.\n•\nSustained downward pressure on oil and other commodities prices and trading activity in those markets could have a material adverse effect on the rate of growth of Platts’ revenue, including subscription and licensing fees.\nIntroduction of new or enhanced products and services could impact our profitability.\n19\nTable of Contents\n•\nWe operate in highly competitive markets that continue to change to adapt to customer needs.\n•\nIn order to maintain a competitive position, we must continue to invest in new offerings and enhancements, including new ways to deliver our products and services.\n•\nThese new or enhanced offerings resulting from our investments may not achieve market acceptance, may not be profitable or may be less profitable than what we have experienced historically.\n•\nWe could experience threats to our existing businesses from the rise of new competitors due to the rapidly changing environment in which we operate.\nOur ability to develop, adapt, or implement new and improved processes and technology may adversely impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nThe rapid change of technology is a key feature of all of the markets in which we operate. To succeed in the future, we will need to deploy improved processes and technology to innovate, design, develop, assemble, test, market, and support new products and enhancements to our existing products in a timely and cost-effective manner.\n•\nInnovation and constant development in support of new products and enhancements to existing products calls for the implementation of new and improved processes and technologies that require related change management efforts. While we employ a certain level of internal and external resources to mitigate the risks associated with implementing process and technology improvements, we may face unexpected challenges in execution that may require more management attention than expected, thus diverting management time and energy from other businesses. The foregoing and other unforeseen factors could also result in business being disrupted for a period of time as well as additional commitments of financial resources.\n•\nEnhancing existing products and developing new products often requires effective collaboration across various functions and business lines of the Company.  Ineffective or insufficient collaboration across functions and business lines decreases our ability to expand geographically, enhance products, innovate, increase sales, leads to brand confusion and may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nA significant increase in operating costs and expenses could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\n•\nOur major expenditures include employee compensation and capital investments.\n•\nWe offer competitive salary and benefit packages in order to attract and retain the quality employees required to grow and expand our businesses. Compensation costs are influenced by general economic factors, including those affecting the cost of health insurance and postretirement benefits, and any trends specific to the employee skill sets we require.\n•\nWe make significant investments in information technology data centers and other technology initiatives and we cannot provide assurances that such investments will result in increased revenues.\n•\nAlthough we believe we are prudent in our investment strategies and execution of our implementation plans, there is no assurance as to the ultimate recoverability or effectiveness of these investments.  Despite our existing strategies and while not material to our operations, we did experience increased attrition in 2021.\nIncreased availability of free or relatively inexpensive information sources may reduce demand for our products and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nIn recent years, more public sources of free or relatively inexpensive information have become available, particularly through the Internet, and advances in public cloud computing and open source software is expected to continue.\n•\nPublic sources of free or relatively inexpensive information can reduce demand for our products and services. Demand could also be reduced as a result of cost-cutting initiatives at certain companies and organizations. Although we believe our products are enhanced by our analysis, tools and applications, our financial results may be adversely affected if our customers choose to use these public sources as a substitute for our products or services.\nConsolidation of customers as well as staffing levels across our customer base could impact our available markets and revenue growth.\n•\nOur businesses have a customer base which is largely comprised of members from the corporate, financial services and commodities industries. The consolidation of customers resulting from mergers and acquisitions across these industries can result in reductions in the number of firms and workforce which can impact the size of our customer base.\n•\nOur customers that strive to reduce their operating costs may seek to reduce their spending on our products and services. If a large number of smaller customers or a critical number of larger customers reduce their spending with us, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n•\nAlternatively, customers may use other strategies to reduce their overall spending on financial and commodity market products and services by consolidating their spending with fewer vendors, including by selecting other vendors with lower-cost offerings, or by self-sourcing their need for financial and commodity market products and services. If customers elect to consolidate their spending on financial and commodity market products and services with other\n20\nTable of Contents\nvendors and not us, if we lose business to lower priced competitors, or if customers elect to self-source their product and service needs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected.\n•\nA material portion of our revenues in our Indices business is concentrated in some of our largest customers, who have significant assets under management in index funds and exchange-traded funds. A loss of a substantial portion of revenue from our largest customers could have a material and adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf we lose key outside suppliers of data and products or if the data or products of these suppliers have errors or are delayed, we may not be able to provide our clients with the information and products they desire.\n•\nOur ability to produce our products and develop new products is dependent upon the products of other suppliers, including certain data, software and service suppliers. Some of our products and their related value are dependent upon updates from our data suppliers and most of our information and data products are dependent upon continuing access to historical and current data.\n•\nWe utilize certain data provided by third-party data sources in a variety of ways, including large volumes of data from certain stock exchanges around the world.\n•\nIf the data from our suppliers has errors, is delayed, has design defects, is unavailable on acceptable terms or is not available at all, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nSome of our agreements with data suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice. Termination of one or more of our significant data agreements or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with, a data provider’s information could decrease the available information for us to use (and offer our clients) and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur ability to protect our intellectual property rights could impact our competitive position.\n•\nWe consider many of our products and services to be proprietary. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm the value of and revenue generated by such assets as well as our reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively. Businesses we acquire may also have intellectual property portfolios which increase the complexity of managing our intellectual property portfolio and protecting our competitive position.\n•\nOur products contain intellectual property delivered through a variety of digital and other media. Our ability to achieve anticipated results depends in part on our ability to defend our intellectual property rights against infringement and misappropriation. Our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by inadequate or changing legal and technological protections for intellectual property and proprietary rights in some jurisdictions and markets. For example, we do business in a number of countries included on the Priority Watch List maintained by the Office of the United States Trade Representative and which are currently thought to afford less protection to intellectual property rights generally than some other jurisdictions. The lack of strong patent and other intellectual property protection in such jurisdictions referenced above may significantly increase our vulnerability as regards unauthorized disclosure or use of our intellectual property and undermine our competitive position.\n•\nOur products also contain intellectual property of third party sources. Any violation by us of the intellectual property rights of such third parties could result in termination of the relevant source agreement, litigation and reputational damage which could materially and adversely affects our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, especially abrupt changes, could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\nFuture legislation, regulatory reform or policy changes, such as financial services regulatory reform, U.S. oil regulation, government-sponsored enterprise reform and increased infrastructure spending and significant changes in trade policy (including sanctions), could impact our business. Changes in legislation, regulation or policy increase the likelihood that we will fail to appropriately adapt to changes in our compliance obligations, particularly when such changes happen abruptly, such as following a change in government. Any of the forgoing changes could impact our results of operations and cash flows directly; such changes may also impact our business by creating increased volatility and uncertainty in the financial and commodities markets. At this time, we cannot predict the scope or nature of these changes or assess what the overall effect of such potential changes could be on our results of operations or cash flows.\nRegulatory changes and economic conditions relating to the United Kingdom’s withdrawal from the EU could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\n•\nThe United Kingdom’s exit from the EU on January 31, 2020 (“Brexit”) could lead to legal uncertainty and potentially divergent national laws and regulations between the UK and the EU as the UK determines which EU laws to replace or replicate and the EU determines how to treat regulated activities (e.g., the activities of credit rating agencies) originating in the UK. Our businesses are subject to increasing regulation of the financial services and commodities industries in Europe. Potential changes in EU regulation, divergent interpretations by the UK of any replicated EU\n21\nTable of Contents\nlaws and/or additional regulation in the UK could cause additional operating obligations and increased costs for our businesses.\n•\nChanges to UK immigration policy as a result of Brexit could adversely affect our ability to retain talent for our European operations.\n•\nAny of these effects of Brexit, and others we cannot anticipate, could adversely affect our business, business opportunities, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The lack of certainty creates the risk that notwithstanding that we have devoted valuable resources to a thorough preparation for the impact of Brexit on our European operations, we may not be adequately prepared for an unforeseen outcome.\nOur inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem could cause material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm or legal liability.\n•\nIn addition to the COVID-19 Risks outlined above, should we experience a local or regional disaster or other business continuity problem, such as an earthquake, hurricane, flood, civil unrest, protests, terrorist attack, another outbreak of pandemic or contagious diseases, security breach, cyber attack, data breach, power loss, telecommunications failure or other natural or man-made disaster, our ability to continue to operate will depend, in part, on the availability of our personnel, our office facilities and the proper functioning of our computer, telecommunication and other related systems and operations. In such an event, we could experience operational challenges with regard to particular areas of our operations, such as key executive officers or personnel, that could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n•\nWe regularly assess and take steps to improve our existing business continuity plans and key management succession. However, a disaster on a significant scale or affecting certain of our key operating areas within or across regions, or our inability to successfully recover should we experience a disaster or other business continuity problem, could materially interrupt our business operations and result in material financial loss, loss of human capital, regulatory actions, reputational harm, damaged client relationships or legal liability.\nOutsourcing certain aspects of our business could result in disruption and increased costs.\n•\nWe have outsourced certain functions to third-party service providers to leverage leading specialized capabilities and achieve cost efficiencies, and such functions may be further outsourced. Outsourcing these functions involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not perform to our standards or legal requirements, may not produce reliable results, may not perform in a timely manner, may not maintain the confidentiality of our proprietary information, or may fail to perform at all. Failure of these third parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, confidentiality, or other obligations to us could result in material financial loss, higher costs, regulatory actions and reputational harm.\n•\nOutsourcing these functions also involves the risk that the third-party service providers may not maintain adequate physical, technical and administrative safeguards to protect the security of our confidential information and data. Failure of these third parties to maintain these safeguards could result in unauthorized access to our systems or a system or network disruption that could lead to improper disclosure of confidential information or data, regulatory penalties and remedial costs.\n•\nWe also rely on the business infrastructure and systems of third parties with whom we do business and to whom we outsource the maintenance and development of operational and technological functionality, including third-party cloud infrastructure. Our cloud infrastructure providers, or other service providers, could experience system breakdowns or failures, outages, downtime, cyber attacks, adverse changes to financial condition, bankruptcy or other adverse conditions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and reputation. Thus, our plans to increase the amount of our infrastructure that we outsource to “the cloud” or to other third parties may increase our risk exposure.\nWe rely heavily on network systems and the Internet and any failures or disruptions may adversely affect our ability to serve our customers.\n•\nMany of our products and services are delivered electronically, and our customers rely on our ability to process transactions rapidly and deliver substantial quantities of data on computer-based networks. Our customers also depend on the continued capacity, reliability and security of our electronic delivery systems, our websites and the Internet.\n•\nOur ability to deliver our products and services electronically may be impaired due to infrastructure or network failures, malicious or defective software, human error, natural disasters, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.\n•\nDelays in our ability to deliver our products and services electronically may harm our reputation and result in the loss of customers. In addition, a number of our customers entrust us with storing and securing their data and information on our servers.\n•\nAlthough we have disaster recovery plans that include backup facilities for our primary data centers, our systems are not always fully redundant, and our disaster planning may not always be sufficient or effective. As such, these disruptions may affect our ability to store, handle and secure such data and information.\nOur operations and infrastructure may malfunction or fail, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n22\nTable of Contents\n•\nOur ability to conduct business may be materially and adversely impacted by a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses and the communities in which we are located, including New York City, the location of our headquarters, and major cities worldwide in which we have offices.\n•\nThis may include a disruption involving physical or technological infrastructure used by us or third parties with or through whom we conduct business, whether due to human error, natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, break-ins, sabotage, intentional acts of vandalism, acts of terrorism, political unrest, war or otherwise. Our efforts to secure and plan for potential disruptions of our major operating systems may not be successful.\n•\nWe rely on our information technology environment and certain critical databases, systems and applications to support key product and service offerings. We believe we have appropriate policies, processes and internal controls to ensure the stability of our information technology, provide security from unauthorized access to our systems and maintain business continuity, but our business could be subject to significant disruption and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected by unanticipated system failures, data corruption or unauthorized access to our systems.\n•\nWe also do not have fully redundant systems for most of our smaller office locations and low-risk systems, and our disaster recovery plan does not include restoration of non-essential services. If a disruption occurs in one of our locations or systems and our personnel in those locations or those who rely on such systems are unable to utilize other systems or communicate with or travel to other locations, such persons’ ability to service and interact with our clients and customers may suffer.\n•\nWe cannot predict with certainty all of the adverse effects that could result from our failure, or the failure of a third party, to efficiently address and resolve these delays and interruptions. A disruption to our operations or infrastructure could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nInability to attract and retain key qualified personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nThe development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, experience and ability of our highly skilled, educated and trained employees. Accordingly, our business is dependent on successfully attracting, retaining and training talented employees in a highly competitive business environment. If the Company is less successful in its recruiting efforts, or if it is unable to retain key employees, its ability to develop and deliver successful products and services or achieve strategic goals may be adversely affected.\nOur reputation, credibility, and brand are key assets and competitive advantages of our Company and our business may be affected by how we are perceived in the marketplace.\n•\nOur reputation, credibility, and the strength of our brand are key competitive strengths.\n•\nGiven our role in the financial and commodities markets, our ability to attract and retain customers is uniquely affected by external perceptions of our reputation, credibility, and brand.\n•\nWe provide credit ratings, pricing and valuation services, benchmark products, and indices, many of which depend on contributions or inputs from third parties or market participants. Our customers and other market participants expect us to be able to demonstrate that our products and services are produced independently and are not readily subject to manipulation. We believe our products and services are designed with appropriate methodologies, processes, and procedures to maintain independence and integrity; however, we may not be able to prevent third parties or market participants from working together or colluding to try to manipulate their inputs and thus the resulting outputs of our products and services. From time to time, we are involved in third-party investigations or litigation related to the commodities and asset classes our products and services serve. Any failures, negative publicity, investigations, or lawsuits that implicate the independence and integrity of our pricing and valuation services, benchmarks, and indices could result in a loss of confidence in the administration of these products and services and could harm our reputation and our business.\n•\nNegative perceptions or publicity could damage our reputation with customers, prospects, regulators, and the public generally, which could negatively impact, among other things, our ability to attract and retain customers, employees and suppliers, as well as suitable candidates for acquisition or other combinations.\n•\nDamage to our reputation, credibility, and brand could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations.\nOur expansion into and investments in new markets may not be successful.\nWe believe there remains significant opportunity to expand our business into major geographic and product markets (including China and ESG, respectively), and we are in the process of such expansion efforts. Expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment and attention from management. There can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets, and if we do not, we may be unable to recover our investment spent to expand our business into these markets and may forgo opportunities in more lucrative markets, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n23\nTable of Contents\nWe are exposed to multiple risks associated with the global nature of our operations.\n•\nThe geographic breadth of our activities subjects us to significant legal, economic, operational, market, compliance and reputational risks. These include, among others, risks relating to:\n◦\neconomic and political conditions around the world,\n◦\ninflation,\n◦\nfluctuation in interest rates and currency exchange rates,\n◦\nlimitations that foreign governments may impose on the conversion of currency or the payment of dividends or other remittances to us from our non-U.S. subsidiaries,\n◦\ndiffering accounting principles and standards,\n◦\nincreases in taxes or changes in U.S. or foreign tax laws, including the possible increase in the U.S. corporate income tax rate and other changes in tax policy proposed by the Biden administration,\n◦\npotential costs and difficulties in complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations (including tax systems) administered by foreign government agencies, some of which may conflict with U.S. or other sources of law,\n◦\nchanges in applicable laws and regulatory requirements, including data localization requirements,\n◦\nthe possibility of nationalization, expropriation, price controls, withdrawal of licenses to operate, and other restrictive governmental actions,\n◦\ncompetition with local rating agencies that have greater familiarity, longer operating histories and/or support from local governments or other institutions, and\n◦\ncivil unrest, protests, terrorism, unstable governments, geopolitical uncertainties and legal systems, and other factors.\nAdverse developments in any of these areas could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nAdditionally, we are subject to complex U.S., European and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations abroad, including trade sanctions laws, anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws such as the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010, anti-money laundering laws, and other financial crimes laws. Our internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs related to these topics may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. A determination that we have violated such laws could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, business, financial condition or results of operations.\n•\nCompliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to our international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies, or restrictions on business conduct and could have a material adverse effect on our reputation, our ability to attract and retain employees, our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n24\nTable of Contents"

(together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” “we,” “us” or “our”) for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The MD&A provides information of factors that we believe are important in understanding our results of operations and comparability and certain other factors that may affect our future results. The MD&A should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (“U.S. GAAP”).\nThe MD&A includes the following sections:\n•\nOverview\n•\nResults of Operations\n•\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n•\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information\n•\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n•\nRecent Accounting Standards\nCertain of the statements below are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. In addition, any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty. See Forward-Looking Statements on page 4 of this report.\nOVERVIEW\nWe are a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture.\nOur operations consist of four reportable segments: S&P Global Ratings (\"Ratings\"), S&P Global Market Intelligence (\"Market Intelligence\"), S&P Global Platts (\"Platts\") and S&P Dow Jones Indices (\"Indices\").\n•\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.\n•\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services.\n•\nPlatts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.\n•\nIndices is a global index provider maintaining a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.\nMerger Agreement\nIn November of 2020, S&P Global and IHS Markit Ltd (\"IHS Markit\") entered into a merger agreement, pursuant to which, among other things, a subsidiary of S&P Global will merge with and into IHS Markit, with IHS Markit surviving the merger as a wholly owned subsidiary of S&P Global. Under the terms of the merger agreement, each share of IHS Markit issued and outstanding (other than excluded shares and dissenting shares) will be converted into the right to receive 0.2838 fully paid and nonassessable shares of S&P Global common stock (and, if applicable, cash in lieu of fractional shares, without interest), less any applicable withholding taxes. On March 11, 2021, S&P Global and IHS Markit shareholders voted to approve the merger agreement. As of December 31, 2021, IHS Markit had approximately 399.1 million shares outstanding. Subject to certain closing conditions, the merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.\n30\nTable of Contents\nShareholder Return\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2021, we have returned approximately $4.3 billion to our shareholders through a combination of share repurchases and our quarterly dividends: we completed share repurchases of approximately $2.4 billion and distributed regular quarterly dividends totaling approximately $1.9 billion. Also, on January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.77 per share. Following the expected closing of the merger with IHS Markit, the Board of Directors will revisit the dividend policy of the combined Company.\nKey Results\n1\n% changes in the tables throughout the MD&A are calculated off of the actual number, not the rounded number presented.\n2\n2021 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $249 million, employee severance charges of $19 million, gain on dispositions of $11 million, a lease impairment of $3 million, Kensho retention related expense of $2 million, acquisition-related costs of $4 million and recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2020 includes lease impairments of $120 million, employee severance charges of $66 million, IHS Markit merger costs of $24 million, a gain on dispositions $16 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $12 million, lease-related costs of $11 million and Kensho retention related expense of $11 million. 2019 includes a gain on the sale of RigData and SPIAS of $27 million and $22 million, respectively, employee severance charges of $25 million, Kensho retention related expense of $21 million, lease impairments of $11 million and acquisition-related costs of $4 million.\n2021\nRevenue increased 11% with an unfavorable impact of 1 percentage point from the net impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. Revenue growth at Ratings was driven by an increase in both transaction revenue and non-transaction revenue. Transaction revenue increased due to higher bank loan ratings revenue and structured finance revenue. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance, entity credit ratings, an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and higher Ratings Evaluation Service (“RES”) revenue. Revenue growth at Market Intelligence was driven by subscription revenue growth in Market Intelligence Desktop products, Credit Risk Solutions and Data Management Solutions. Revenue growth at Indices was due to higher average levels of assets under management for exchange traded funds (\"ETFs\") and mutual funds and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower exchange-traded derivative revenue. The revenue increase at Platts was primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 17%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Excluding the unfavorable impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2021 of 31 percentage points, partially offset by higher lease impairment charges in 2020 of 16 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 7 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles from acquisitions in 2020 of 4 percentage points and higher technology-related impairment charges in 2020 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 15%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth at all of our reportable segments combined with a decrease in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases.\n2020\nRevenue increased 11%, with a favorable benefit of 1 percentage point from the net impact of recent acquisitions and dispositions, driven by increases at all of our reportable segments. Revenue growth at Ratings was mainly driven by higher corporate bond ratings revenue, partially offset by a decrease in bank loan ratings revenue and structured finance transaction revenues. Revenue growth at Market Intelligence was driven by subscription revenue growth in Market Intelligence Desktop products, Credit Risk Solutions and Data Management Solutions. Revenue growth at Indices was due to higher assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds, an increase in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and higher data subscription revenue.

The increase was primarily due to revenue growth at all of our reportable segments combined with a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to the 2019 novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\"), partially offset by an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount.\nWe are continuing to closely monitor the impact of the outbreak of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business as the pandemic and associated macroeconomic impacts continue to evolve. While COVID-19 did not have a material adverse effect on our reported results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we are unable to predict the ultimate impact that it may have on our business, future results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nOur Strategy\nWe are a leading provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. Our purpose is to provide the intelligence that is essential for companies, governments and individuals to make decisions with conviction.

Subscription revenue increased primarily from growth in Market Intelligence's average contract values and continued demand for Platts proprietary content. Higher data subscription revenue at Indices also contributed to subscription revenue growth. Non-subscription / transaction revenue increased due to an increase in bank loan ratings revenue and higher structured finance revenue at Ratings. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance, entity credit ratings, an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and higher RES revenue at Ratings. Asset linked fees increased reflecting higher average levels of assets under management for ETFs and mutual funds at Indices. The decrease in sales usage-based royalties was primarily driven by lower exchange-traded derivative revenue at Indices. See “Segment Review” below for further information.\nThe favorable impact of foreign exchange rates increased revenue by less than 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year.\n2020\nRevenue increased 11% as compared to 2019. Subscription revenue increased primarily from growth in Market Intelligence's average contract values and continued demand for Platts proprietary content.

Excluding the unfavorable impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2021 of 2 percentage points, offset by higher lease impairments in 2020 of 1 percentage point, higher employee severance charges in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point and higher lease-related costs in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses increased 11%. Increases at Ratings, Platts and Indices were primarily driven by higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs due to additional headcount and annual merit increases. The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to an increase in technology costs and higher incentive costs, partially offset by a decrease in compensation costs due to reduced headcount. These increases were partially offset by lower occupancy costs and a decrease in legal related costs at Indices.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization decreased $28 million, or 13%, compared to 2020 primarily due to a decrease in intangible asset amortization related to assets that became fully amortized, partially offset by an increase in amortization expense driven by the acquisitions of RobecoSAM and Greenwich Associates LLC in January 2020 and February 2020, respectively.\nThe following tables provide an analysis by segment of our operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019:\nN/M - Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\nIn 2020, selling and general expenses include a technology-related impairment charge of $11 million, lease-related costs of $5 million and employee severance charges of $4 million.\nIn 2019, selling and general expenses include employee severance charges of $11 million.\n2\nIn 2020, selling and general expenses include employee severance charges of $27 million and lease-related costs of $3 million.

The increase at Market Intelligence was primarily due to higher compensation costs driven by investments in growth initiatives and the acquisition of 451 Research, LLC, and higher incentive costs. The increase at Ratings was primarily driven by higher incentive costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19.\nIntersegment eliminations primarily relate to a royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.\nSelling and General Expenses\nSelling and general expenses increased 15%. Excluding the impact of higher lease impairment charges in 2020 of 9 percentage points, higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 3 percentage costs, lease-related costs in 2020 of 1 percentage point, IHS Markit merger costs in 2020 of 1 percentage point and a technology-related impairment charge of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher Kensho related retention expense in 2019 of 1 percentage point, selling and general expenses increased 1%. This increase was primarily driven by an increase at Market Intelligence due to higher compensation costs driven by investments in growth initiatives and the acquisition of 451 Research, LLC, and higher incentive costs, and an increase at Indices driven by an increase in legal related costs. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 and lower rental expense from a reduction in the Company's real estate footprint.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization increased $2 million, or 1%, compared to 2019 due to an increase in depreciation expense related to assets that began being depreciated in the second half of 2019 and an increase in amortization expense driven by the acquisitions of RobecoSAM, Greenwich Associates LLC and 451 Research, LLC in January 2020, February 2020 and December 2019, respectively.\nGain on Dispositions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the following dispositions that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $11 million, which was included in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income:\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $8 million ($6 million after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income related to the sale of office facilities in India.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3 million ($3 million after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income related to the sale of Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC (\"SPIAS\"), a business within our Market Intelligence segment, that occurred in July of 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the following dispositions that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $16 million, which was included in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income:\n•\nIn January of 2020, Market Intelligence entered into a strategic alliance to transition S&P Global Market Intelligence's Investor Relations (\"IR\") webhosting business to Q4 Inc.

Segment operating profit is defined as operating profit before Corporate Unallocated expense. Segment operating profit is not, however, a measure of financial performance under U.S. GAAP, and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner.\nThe table below reconciles segment operating profit to total operating profit:\n1\n2021 includes a gain on disposition of $6 million, employee severance charges of $3 million and recovery of lease-related costs of $4 million. 2020 includes a technology-related impairment charge of $11 million, lease-related costs of $5 million and employee severance charges of $4 million. 2019 includes employee severance charges of $11 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $10 million, $7 million and $2 million, respectively.\n2\n2021 includes acquisition-related costs of $2 million. 2021and 2020 include employee severance charges of $3 million and $27 million, respectively, a gain on dispositions of $3 million and $12 million, respectively, and lease-related costs of $1 million and $3 million, respectively. 2019 includes a gain on the sale of SPIAS of $22 million, employee severance charges of $6 million and acquisition-related costs of $4 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $65 million, $76 million and $75 million, respectively.\n3\n2021 includes recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $11 million and lease-related costs of $2 million. 2019 includes a gain on the sale of RigData of $27 million and\nemployee severance charges of $1 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $8 million, $9 million, and $12 million.\n4\n2021  includes recovery of lease-related costs of $1 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a lease impairment charge of $4 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million.\n5\n2021 and 2020 includes IHS Markit merger costs of $249 million and $24 million, respectively. 2021, 2020, and 2019 include employee severance charges of $13 million, $19 million and $7 million, respectively, lease impairments of $3 million, $116 million and $11 million, respectively, and Kensho retention related expenses of $2 million, $12 million, and $21 million, respectively. 2021 includes lease-related costs of $4 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and a gain on disposition of $2 million. 2020 includes a gain related to an acquisition of $1 million.  Additionally, 2021, 2020 and 2019 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $7 million, $26 million, and $28 million.\n2021\n39\nTable of Contents\nSegment Operating Profit —\nIncreased $711 million or 18% as compared to 2020. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 2 percentage points and higher lease-related costs of 1 percentage point in 2020, segment operating profit increased 15%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue at all of our reportable segments combined with a decrease in occupancy costs, partially offset by higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases. See “Segment Review” below for further information.\nCorporate Unallocated Expense—\nCorporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate functions, select initiatives, unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses. Corporate Unallocated expense increased 33% compared to 2020. Excluding the unfavorable impact of IHS Markit merger costs in 2021 of 45 percentage points, higher lease-related costs in 2021 of 1 percentage point and higher acquisition-related costs in 2021 of 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher lease impairments in 2020 of 23 percentage points, higher amortization of intangibles in 2020 of 4 percentage points, higher Kensho retention related expense in 2020 of 2 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point, Corporate Unallocated expense increased 16% primarily due to higher incentive costs.\nForeign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point. This impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by re-calculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual businesses functional currency.\n2020\nSegment Operating Profit —\nIncreased $498 million, or 14% as compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point, a higher gain on dispositions in 2019 of 1 percentage point primarily related to the sale of RigData and SPIAS, a technology-related impairment charge in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point and lease-related costs in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point, segment operating profit increased 17%. The increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue at all of our reportable segments combined with a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19, partially offset by an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs driven by annual merit increases and additional headcount.\nCorporate Unallocated Expense\n—\nCorporate Unallocated expense includes costs for corporate center functions, select initiatives and unoccupied office space and Kensho, included in selling and general expenses. Corporate Unallocated expense increased by $107 million or 50% as compared to 2019. Excluding the impact of higher lease impairment charges in 2020 of 53 percentage points, IHS Markit merger costs in 2020 of 12 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 6 percentage points, partially offset by lower Kensho retention related expense in 2020 of 6 percentage points and a gain on disposition in 2020 of 2 percentage points, Corporate Unallocated expense decreased 12% primarily driven by lower rental expense from a reduction in the Company's real estate footprint, a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses and lower professional fees, partially offset by contributions to the S&P Global Foundation made in 2020.\nForeign exchange rates had a favorable impact on operating profit of 1 percentage point. The foreign exchange rate impact refers to constant currency comparisons and the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. Constant currency impacts are estimated by recalculating current year results of foreign operations using the average exchange rate from the prior year. Remeasurement impacts are based on the variance between current-year and prior-year foreign exchange rate fluctuations on monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the individual business' functional currency.\n40\nTable of Contents\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nOther (income) expense, net primarily includes the net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans.\nOther income, net for 2021 and 2020 was $62 million and $31 million, respectively, and other expense, net for 2019 was $98 million\n. During the year ended December 31, 2020, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.K. pension plan, triggering the recognition of a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $3 million. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed the Company’s obligation to pay pension benefits to approximately 4,600 retirees and beneficiaries. This purchase eliminates all future investment or mortality risk associated with these retirees. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded with pension plan assets. As a result, the Company’s outstanding pension benefit obligation was reduced by approximately $370 million, representing approximately 24% of the total obligations of the Company’s qualified pension plans. In connection with this transaction, the Company recorded a pre-tax settlement charge of $113 million, reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan. Excluding these charges, other income, net was $62 million, $34 million and $14 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in other (income) expense, net in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily due to a higher gain on investments in 2021 and the increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was primarily due to a higher loss on investments in 2019.\nInterest Expense, net\nNet interest expense for 2021 decreased $22 million or 16% compared to 2020, primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the refinancing of  a series of our senior notes in August of 2020. Net interest expense for 2020 remained relatively unchanged compared to 2019, increasing less than 1%.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nThe year ended December 31, 2020 includes $279 million related to the redemption fee on the early retirement of our 4.4% senior notes due in 2026 and a portion of the 6.55% senior notes due in 2037 and 4.5% senior notes due in 2048 in the third quarter of 2020. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes $57 million of costs associated with the early repayment of our 3.3% Senior Notes and a portion of our 6.55% Senior Notes.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 21.6%, 21.5% and 21.4% for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to a change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. The increase in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the recognition of excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments in the statement of income.\nSegment Review\nRatings\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research, and analytics to investors, issuers and other market participants. Credit ratings are one of several tools investors can use when making decisions about purchasing bonds and other fixed income investments. They are opinions about credit risk, and our ratings express our opinion about the ability and willingness of an issuer, such as a corporation or state or city government, to meet its financial obligations in full and on time. Our credit ratings can also relate to the credit quality of an individual debt issue, such as a corporate or municipal bond, and the relative likelihood that the issue may default.\nRatings disaggregates its revenue between transaction and non-transaction. Transaction revenue primarily includes fees associated with:\n•\nratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments, as well as structured finance debt instruments; and\n•\nbank loan ratings.\nNon-transaction revenue primarily includes fees for surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings. Royalty revenue for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $136 million, $128 million and $118 million, respectively.\n41\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n1\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we reevaluated our transaction and non-transaction presentation for Ratings which resulted in a reclassification from transaction revenue to non-transaction revenue of $8 million and $7 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2\n2021 includes a gain on disposition of $6 million, recovery of lease-related costs of $4 million, and employee severance charges of $3 million. 2020 includes a technology-related impairment charge of $11 million, lease-related costs of $5 million and employee severance charges of $4 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 include amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $10 million, $7 million and $2 million, respectively.\n2021\nRevenue increased 14%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. Transaction revenue increased due to higher bank loan ratings revenue driven by increased M&A activity and an increase in structured finance revenue primarily driven by increased issuance of U.S. CLOs. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance, entity credit ratings, an increase in revenue at our CRISIL subsidiary and higher RES revenue driven by increased M&A activity. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories.\nOperating profit increased 18%, with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of 1 percentage point. The impact of revenue growth and lower occupancy costs was partially offset by an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs due to annual merit increases, additional headcount and human capital investments, as well as the ramp up of technology and strategic initiatives.\n2020\nRevenue increased 16% including a favorable benefit of 1 percentage point from the impact of recent acquisitions. Transaction revenue grew due to an increase in corporate bond ratings revenue primarily driven by higher corporate bond issuance in the U.S. mainly resulting from borrowers’ need for increased liquidity in light of the pandemic-related economic downturn, historically low borrowing costs, and central bank lending actions initially announced at the end of the first quarter of 2020, partially offset by a decrease in bank loan ratings revenue and structured finance revenues. Non-transaction revenue increased primarily due to an increase in surveillance revenue, royalty revenue, and higher RES activity driven by increased M&A activity in the fourth quarter of 2020. Transaction and non-transaction revenue also benefited from improved contract terms across product categories. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point. Revenue was favorably impacted by the acquisitions of the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM and Greenwich Associates LLC in January of 2020 and February of 2020, respectively. See Note 2 -\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the consolidated financial\n42\nTable of Contents\nstatements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOperating profit increased 25%, with a 2 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of a technology-related impairment charge in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point, lease-related costs in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point and higher amortization of intangible assets in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point, partially offset by higher employee severance charges in 2019 of less than 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 25%. The impact of revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in incentive costs and higher compensation costs due to annual merit increases and additional headcount, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19.\nMarket Issuance Volumes\nWe monitor market issuance volumes regularly within Ratings. Market issuance volumes noted within the discussion that follows are based on where an issuer is located or where the assets associated with an issue are located. Structured Finance issuance includes amounts when a transaction closes, not when initially priced and excludes domestically-rated Chinese issuance. The following tables depict changes in issuance levels as compared to the prior year based on data from SDC Platinum for Corporate bond issuance and based on a composite of external data feeds and Ratings' internal estimates for Structured Finance issuance.\n*\nIncludes Industrials and Financial Services.\n•\nHigh-yield issuance was up in both the U.S and Europe as issuers were taking advantage of historically low borrowing costs. Investment-grade issuance was down in both the U.S. and Europe reflecting comparisons against a strong prior year period as a number of large financing transactions contributed to the increase in investment-grade issuance in the U.S. and Europe in 2020.\n**\nRepresents no activity in 2021 and 2020.\n•\nABS issuance increased in the U.S. and Europe primarily driven by growth across all sub asset classes led by Credit Cards, Student Loans, Autos and Esoterics.\n•\nCLO issuance increased in the U.S. and European structured credit markets driven by growth in leveraged loans due to strong M&A activity and investor demand for high risk adjusted yield.\n•\nCMBS issuance was up in the U.S. reflecting increased market volume in large single-asset single-borrower (SASB) as market conditions improved from early in the pandemic. CMBS issuance in Europe was also up, although from a low 2020 base.\n•\nRMBS issuance was up in the U.S. and Europe reflecting increased market volume due to an improved housing market.\n•\nCovered bond (debt securities backed by mortgages or other high-quality assets that remain on the issuer's balance sheet) issuance in Europe increased in 2021 driven by improved market conditions.\n43\nTable of Contents\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nRevenue increased in 2021 primarily driven by an increase in bank loan ratings revenue, structured finance transaction revenues and non-transaction revenue. In 2021, Ratings continued to focus on developing key product offerings in ESG and launched new Social and Sustainability products. ESG initiatives and international expansion in China continues to be areas of focus for Ratings.\nCRISIL revenue increased across all segments, primarily driven by Global Benchmarking Analytics and Global Research & Risk solutions from the recovery of the banking sector and increased focus on sustainability, credit risk and model validation projects. This growth is expected to extend into 2022 led by the financial research and research & analytics businesses.\nContinued focus on maintaining an effective analytical workforce with targeted hiring and a competitive compensation structure. Technology investments from the expansion and improvements in the cloud infrastructure, as well as enhancements to the delivery and value add of the Ratings content to customers.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nGeneral\nRatings and many of the securities that it rates are subject to extensive regulation in both the U.S. and in other countries, and therefore existing and proposed laws and regulations can impact the Company’s operations and the markets in which it operates. Additional laws and regulations have been adopted but not yet implemented or have been proposed or are being considered. In addition, in certain countries, governments may provide financial or other support to locally-based rating agencies. For example, governments may from time to time establish official rating agencies or credit ratings criteria or procedures for evaluating local issuers. We have reviewed the new laws, regulations and rules which have been adopted and we have implemented, or are planning to implement, changes as required. We do not believe that such new laws, regulations or rules will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Other laws, regulations and rules relating to credit rating agencies are being considered by local, national, foreign and multinational bodies and are likely to continue to be considered in the future, including provisions seeking to reduce regulatory and investor reliance on credit ratings, remuneration and rotation of credit rating agencies, and liability standards applicable to credit rating agencies. The impact on us of the adoption of any such laws, regulations or rules remains uncertain, but could increase the costs and legal risks relating to Ratings’ rating activities, or adversely affect our ability to compete and/or our remuneration, or result in changes in the demand for credit ratings.\nIn the normal course of business both in the U.S. and abroad, Ratings (or the legal entities comprising Ratings) are defendants in numerous legal proceedings and are often the subject of government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries. Many of these proceedings, investigations and inquiries relate to the ratings activity of Ratings and are or have been brought by purchasers of rated securities. In addition, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into Ratings’ compliance with applicable laws and regulations. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.\nU.S.\nThe businesses conducted by our Ratings segment are, in certain cases, regulated under the Credit Rating Agency Reform Act of 2006 (the “Reform Act”), the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the “Dodd Frank Act”), the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “Exchange Act”) and/or the laws of the states or other jurisdictions in which they conduct business. The financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the U.S.\nS&P Global Ratings is a credit rating agency that is registered with the SEC as a Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization (“NRSRO”). The SEC first began informally designating NRSROs in 1975 for use of their credit ratings in the determination of capital charges for registered brokers and dealers under the SEC’s Net Capital Rule. The Reform Act created a new SEC registration system for rating agencies that choose to register as NRSROs. Under the Reform Act, the SEC is given authority and oversight of NRSROs and can censure NRSROs, revoke their registration or limit or suspend their registration in certain cases. The rules implemented by the SEC pursuant to the Reform Act, the Dodd Frank Act and the Exchange Act address, among other things, prevention or misuse of material non-public information, conflicts of interest, documentation and assessment of internal controls, and improving transparency of ratings performance and methodologies. The public portions of the current version of S&P Global Ratings’ Form NRSRO are available on S&P Global Ratings’ website.\nEuropean Union\n44\nTable of Contents\nIn the European Union (\"EU\"), the credit rating industry is registered and supervised through a pan-European regulatory framework which is a compilation of three sets of legislative actions. In 2009, the European Parliament passed a regulation (“CRA1”) that established an oversight regime for the credit rating industry in the EU, which became effective in 2010. CRA1 requires the registration, formal regulation and periodic inspection of credit rating agencies operating in the EU. Ratings was granted registration in October of 2011. In January of 2011, the EU established the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”), which, among other things, has direct supervisory responsibility for the registered credit rating industry throughout the EU.\nAdditional rules augmenting the supervisory framework for credit rating agencies went into effect in 2013. Commonly referred to as CRA3, these rules, among other things:\n•\nimpose various additional procedural requirements with respect to ratings of sovereign issuers;\n•\nrequire member states to adopt laws imposing liability on credit rating agencies for an intentional or grossly negligent failure to abide by the applicable regulations;\n•\nimpose mandatory rotation requirements on credit rating agencies hired by issuers of securities for ratings of resecuritizations, which may limit the number of years a credit rating agency can issue ratings for such securities of a particular issuer;\n•\nimpose restrictions on credit rating agencies or their shareholders if certain ownership thresholds are crossed; and\n•\nimpose additional procedural and substantive requirements on the pricing of services.\nThe financial services industry is subject to the potential for increased regulation in the EU.\nOther Jurisdictions\nOutside of the U.S. and the EU, regulators and government officials have also been implementing formal oversight of credit rating agencies. Ratings is subject to regulations in most of the foreign jurisdictions in which it operates and continues to work closely with regulators globally to promote the global consistency of regulatory requirements. This includes the UK, which has established a credit rating agencies oversight regime similar to that in place in the EU, and where Ratings was granted registration with the Financial Conduct Authority on January 1, 2021. Regulators in additional countries may introduce new regulations in the future.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Ratings business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Ratings business, see Note 13 -\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMarket Intelligence\nMarket Intelligence's portfolio of capabilities is designed to help investment professionals, government agencies, corporations and universities track performance, generate alpha, identify investment ideas, understand competitive and industry dynamics, perform valuations and assess credit risk.\nIn December of 2021, as part of our Sustainable1 investments, we completed the acquisition of The Climate Service, Inc. (\"TCS\"), which has developed a climate risk analytics platform assisting corporates, investors and governments with assessing physical climate risks. Sustainable1 is S&P Global's single source of essential sustainability intelligence, bringing together S&P Global's resources and full product suite of data, benchmarking, analytics, evaluations and indices that provide customers with a 360-degree view to help achieve their sustainability goals. The acquisition will add capabilities to S&P Global's leading portfolio of essential ESG insights and solutions for its customers. Through this acquisition, S&P Global will be able to offer its clients even more transparent, robust and comprehensive climate data, models and analytics. We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting. The acquisition of The Climate Service, Inc. is not material to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December of 2021, S&P Global entered into an agreement to sell CUSIP Global Services (\"CGS\") business, included in our Market Intelligence segment, to FactSet Research Systems for $1.925 billion, with the agreement subject to customary purchase price adjustments. The agreement represents continued progress toward completing the pending merger of S&P Global and IHS Markit, and the divestiture is dependent on expected closing of the merger with IHS Markit and other customary conditions. We have also pledged to divest our Leveraged Commentary and Data (“LCD”) business, included in our Market Intelligence segment, along with a related family of leveraged loan indices as a condition for regulatory approval. Under the European Commission's conditional approval of the merger of S&P Global and IHS Markit, execution of an agreement to sell the LCD business can occur after the closing of the merger. The divestitures remain subject to further review and approval by antitrust regulators. Subject to certain closing conditions, the merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.\n45\nTable of Contents\nIn January of 2020, Market Intelligence entered into a strategic alliance to transition S&P Global Market Intelligence's IR webhosting business to Q4, a third party provider of investor relations related services. This alliance integrated Market Intelligence's proprietary data into Q4's portfolio of solutions, enabling further opportunities for commercial collaboration. In connection with transitioning its IR webhosting business to Q4, Market Intelligence received a minority investment in Q4. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $11 million ($6 million after-tax), respectively, in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of IR.\nIn March of 2019, we entered into an agreement to sell SPIAS, a business within our Market Intelligence segment, to GSAM. SPIAS provides non-discretionary investment advice across institutional sub-advisory and intermediary distribution channels globally. On July 1, 2019, we completed the sale of SPIAS to GSAM. During 2019, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $22 million ($12 million after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of SPIAS. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $3 million ($3 million after-tax) and $1 million ($1 million after-tax), respectively, in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of SPIAS in July of 2019.\nSee Note 2 -\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nMarket Intelligence includes the following business lines:\n•\nDesktop\n—\na product suite that provides data, analytics and third-party research for global finance professionals, which includes the Market Intelligence Desktop (which are inclusive of the S&P Capital IQ and SNL Desktop products);\n•\nData Management Solutions\n—\nintegrated bulk data feeds and application programming interfaces that can be customized, which includes Compustat, GICS, Point In Time Financials; and\n•\nCredit Risk Solutions\n—\ncommercial arm that sells Ratings' credit ratings and related data, analytics and research, which includes subscription-based offerings, RatingsDirect® and RatingsXpress®, and Credit Analytics.\nSubscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, analytics, third-party research, and credit ratings-related information primarily through web-based channels, including Market Intelligence Desktop, RatingsDirect®, RatingsXpress®, and Credit Analytics. Non-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing and analytical services.\n46\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n1\n2021 includes employee severance charges of $3 million, a gain on disposition of $3 million, acquisition-related costs of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $27 million, a gain on dispositions of $12 million and lease-related costs of $3 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $65 million, $76 million and $75 million, respectively.\n2021\nRevenue increased 7% driven by subscription revenue growth for RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, certain Market Intelligence Desktop products, and certain data feed products within Data Management Solutions. Excluding the impact of recent dispositions favorably impacting Desktop revenue growth by 1 percentage point, revenue growth at Data Management Solutions, Credit Risk Solutions and Desktop was 11%, 8% and 5%, respectively. Both U.S. revenue and international revenue increased compared to 2021. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 19%, with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact from higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 6 percentage points and higher amortization of intangibles in 2020 of 3 percentage points, partially offset by the impact of a higher gain on the dispositions in 2020 of 3 percentage points, operating profit increased 13%. The impact of revenue growth and lower compensation costs due to reduced headcount was partially offset by an increase in cost of sales and intersegment royalties tied to annualized contract value growth, increased technology costs and higher incentive costs.\n2020\nRevenue increased 8% and was favorably impacted by 1 percentage point from the net effect of the recent acquisition of 451 Research, LLC, offset by the disposition of SPIAS and the IR webhosting business. The increase in revenue was driven by growth in annualized contract values for RatingsXpress®, RatingsDirect®, our data feed products within Data Management Solutions and our Market Intelligence Desktop products. Excluding the impact of the acquisition and dispositions favorably impacting Desktop revenue growth by 3 percentage points, revenue growth at Credit Risk Solutions, Data Management Solutions and Desktop was 9%, 9% and 4%, respectively. Both U.S. revenue and international revenue increased compared to 2019. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of 1 percentage point.\n47\nTable of Contents\nOperating profit increased 4%, with a 3 percentage point favorable impact from foreign exchange rates. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 3 percentage points and a higher gain on dispositions in 2019 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 9%. The impact of revenue growth was partially offset by higher compensation costs primarily due to annual merit increases, an increase in incentive costs and higher technology costs, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nMarket Intelligence continues to focus on developing key product offerings in growth areas such as ESG and growing new products and product features leveraging technology investments. Product launches and innovation continued at Market Intelligence in 2021 with the introduction of several new ESG related products and new products and product features leveraging technology investments.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nThe market for research services is very competitive. Market Intelligence competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its research and advisory services, client service, reputation, price, geographic scope, range of products and services, and technological innovation. For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEuropean Union\nThe EU enacted a package of legislative measures known as MiFID II (\"MiFID II\"), which revises and updates the existing EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive framework, and the substantive provisions became applicable in all EU Member States as of January 3, 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things, require the unbundling of investment research and direct  how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits. Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures, including some technical standards yet to be adopted by the European Commission), the introduction of the MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which Market Intelligence licenses certain products. MiFID II may impose regulatory burdens on Market Intelligence activities in the EU, although the exact impact and costs are not yet known.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Market Intelligence business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Market Intelligence business, see Note 13 -\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nPlatts\nPlatts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets. Platts provides essential price data, analytics, and industry insight enabling the commodity and energy markets to perform with greater transparency and efficiency.\nOn July 31, 2019, we completed the sale of RigData, a business within our Platts segment, to Drilling Info, Inc. RigData is a provider of daily information on rig activity for the natural gas and oil markets across North America. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $27 million ($26 million after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income related to the sale of RigData. See Note 2 -\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the consolidated financial statements of this Form 10-K for further discussion.\nPlatts' revenue is generated primarily through the following sources:\n•\nSubscription revenue\n—\nprimarily from subscriptions to our market data and market insights (price assessments, market reports and commentary and analytics) along with other information products;\n•\nSales usage-based royalties\n—\nprimarily from licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges; and\n•\nNon-subscription revenue\n—\nconference sponsorship, consulting engagements, and events.\n48\nTable of Contents\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\nN/M- Represents a change equal to or in excess of 100% or not meaningful\n1\n2021 includes recovery of lease-related costs of $2 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $11 million and lease-related costs of $2 million. 2021, 2020, and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $8 million, $9 million, and $12 million, respectively.\n2021\nRevenue increased 8% primarily due to continued demand for market data and market insights products driven by expanded product offerings to our existing customers under enterprise use contracts. An increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges mainly due to increased trading volumes in Petroleum and LNG also contributed to revenue growth. Both U.S. revenue and international revenue grew compared to 2021. Petroleum continues to be the most significant revenue driver, followed by natural gas, power & renewables, petrochemicals,  metals & agriculture, and shipping also contributing to revenue growth.\nOperating profit increased 13% with an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the impact of higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 3 percentage points and higher lease-related costs in 2020 of 1%, operating profit increased 9%.  The increase was primarily due to revenue growth partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support business initiatives at Platts and an increase in incentive costs.\n2020\nRevenue increased 4% and was unfavorably impacted by less than 1 percentage point from the net effect of recent acquisitions of Enerdata and Live Rice Index and the disposition of RigData. Revenue increased primarily due to continued demand for  market data and market insights products driven by both expanded product offerings to our existing customers combined with enhanced contract terms. Additionally, an increase in sales usage-based royalties from the licensing of our proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges due to increased trading volumes in the first half of 2020 contributed to revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by a decrease in conference revenue as a result of cancellation and postponement of events due to COVID-19. International revenue grew and U.S. revenue remained relatively unchanged compared to 2019 with the U.S revenue growth rate being unfavorably impacted by the disposition of RigData in July of 2019. Petroleum continues to be the most significant revenue driver, followed by natural gas, power & renewables, metals & agriculture and petrochemicals also contributing to revenue growth. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\n49\nTable of Contents\nOperating profit remained relatively unchanged with a favorable impact from foreign exchange rates of less than 1 percentage point. Excluding the unfavorable impact of the gain on disposition of RigData in 2019 of 6 percentage points and higher employee severance charges in 2020 of 2 percentage points, operating profit increased 8%. The increase was primarily due to revenue growth combined with a reduction in expenses. Expenses decreased primarily due to a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19, lower costs as a result of cancellation and postponement of events due to COVID-19 and the favorable impact of a benefit resulting from one-time costs related to the discontinuation of a product line at Platts in 2019. These decreases were partially offset by an increase in operating costs to support business initiatives at Platts and higher incentive costs.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nIn 2021, sustained demand for market data and market insight products, led by petroleum, continued to drive revenue growth. Platts introduced S&P Platts Dimension Pro in 2021 that provides a fully integrated user experience connecting pricing, market commentary, news and analytics. Additionally, Platts introduced several new ESG related products in 2021. Platts continues to focus on developing new product and product features leveraging technology investments and developing key product offerings in ESG.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nPlatts’ commodities price assessment and information business is subject to increasing regulatory scrutiny.  As discussed below under the heading “Indices-Legal and Regulatory Environment”, the benchmarks industry is subject to the new regulation in the EU (the “EU Benchmark Regulation”) as well as potential increased regulation in other jurisdictions.  Platts has obtained authorization and is now supervised by the\nDutch Authority for the Financial Markets\nin the Netherlands under the EU Benchmark Regulation, will likely need to take similar steps in other jurisdictions including the United Kingdom when the transitional period under the EU Benchmark Regulation (and its UK equivalent) ends, as well as in jurisdictions outside of Europe if they pass similar legislation.  For a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Platts business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEuropean Union\nThe EU has enacted MiFID II, which revise and update the existing EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive and the substantive provisions became applicable in all EU Member States as of January 3, 2018. MiFID II includes provisions that, among other things: (i) impose new conditions and requirements on the licensing of benchmarks and provide for non-discriminatory access to exchanges and clearing houses; (ii) modify the categorization and treatment of certain classes of derivatives; (iii) expand the categories of trading venue that are subject to regulation; (iv) require the unbundling of investment research and direct  how asset managers pay for research either out of a research payment account or from a firm’s profits; and (v) provide for the mandatory trading of certain derivatives on exchanges (complementing the mandatory derivative clearing requirements in the E.U. Market Infrastructure Regulation of 2011). Although the MiFID II package is “framework” legislation (meaning that much of the detail of the rules will be set out in subordinate measures, including some technical standards yet to be adopted by the European Commission), the introduction of the MiFID II package may result in changes to the manner in which Platts licenses its price assessments. MiFID II and the Market Abuse Regulation (\"MAR\") may impose additional regulatory burdens on Platts activities in the EU over time, but they have not yet resulted in increased substantive impact or costs.\nIn October of 2012, IOSCO issued its Principles for Oil Price Reporting Agencies (\"PRA Principles\"), which are intended to enhance the reliability of oil price assessments referenced in derivative contracts subject to regulation by IOSCO members. Platts has aligned its operations with the PRA Principles and, as recommended by IOSCO in its final report on the PRA Principles, has aligned to the PRA Principles for other commodities for which it publishes benchmarks.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Platts business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Indices’ mission is to provide transparent benchmarks to help with decision making, collaborate with the financial community to create innovative products, and provide investors with tools to monitor world markets.\nIndices derives revenue from asset-linked fees when investors direct funds into its proprietary designed or owned indexes, sales usage-based royalties of its indices, and to a lesser extent data subscription arrangements. Specifically, Indices generates revenue from the following sources:\n•\nInvestment vehicles\n—\nasset-linked fees such as ETFs and mutual funds, that are based on the S&P Dow Jones Indices' benchmarks that generate revenue through fees based on assets and underlying funds;\n•\nExchange traded derivatives\n—\ngenerate sales usage-based royalties based on trading volumes of derivatives contracts listed on various exchanges;\n•\nIndex-related licensing fees\n—\nfixed or variable annual and per-issue asset-linked fees for over-the-counter derivatives and retail-structured products; and\n•\nData and customized index subscription fees\n—\nfees from supporting index fund management, portfolio analytics and research.\nThe following table provides revenue and segment operating profit information for the years ended December 31:\n1\n2021 includes recovery of lease-related costs of $1 million. 2020 includes employee severance charges of $5 million, a lease impairment charge of $4 million, a technology-related impairment charge of $2 million and lease-related costs of $1 million. 2021, 2020 and 2019 includes amortization of intangibles from acquisitions of $6 million.\n51\nTable of Contents\n2021\nRevenue at Indices increased 16% primarily due to higher average levels of assets under management (\"AUM\") for ETFs and mutual funds and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower exchange-traded derivative revenue. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 44% to $2.419 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 40% to $2.796 trillion compared to 2020 while exchange-traded derivative activity was impacted by both lower average daily trading volume from reduced volatility and lower rates per trade from a shift in product mix in the first half of 2021. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nOperating profit increased 20%. Excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point, a lease impairment charge in 2020 of 1 percentage point and higher lease-related costs in 2020 of less than 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 17%. The impact of revenue growth and lower legal related costs was partially offset by higher cost of sales, higher incentive costs and an increase in compensation costs driven by additional headcount and annual merit increases. Foreign exchange rates had an unfavorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\n2020\nRevenue increased 8% primarily due to higher average levels of AUM for ETFs and mutual funds, an increase in exchange-traded derivatives revenue and higher data subscription revenue, partially offset by lower over-the-counter derivative revenue. Average levels of AUM for ETFs increased 12% to $1.681 trillion and ending AUM for ETFs increased 18% to $1.998 trillion compared to 2019.\nOperating profit grew 5%. Excluding the impact of employee severance charges in 2020 of 1 percentage point and a lease impairment charge in 2020 of 1 percentage point, operating profit increased 7%. The impact of revenue growth was partially offset by an increase in compensation costs due to annual merit increases and additional headcount as well as professional costs, higher incentive costs and an increase in legal related costs, partially offset by a decrease in travel and entertainment expenses from non-essential travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 and lower cost of sales. Foreign exchange rates had a favorable impact of less than 1 percentage point.\nIndustry Highlights and Outlook\nIndices continues to be the leading index provider for the ETF market space. In 2021, higher average levels of AUM for ETFs contributed to revenue growth. In 2021, Indices continued to launch new ESG ETFs and expand innovative index offerings with key index product launches. Indices continues to focus on developing key product offerings in ESG, multi-asset-class and factor indices and developing new product and product features leveraging technology investments.\nLegal and Regulatory Environment\nOver the past four years the financial benchmarks industry has been subject to specific benchmark regulation in the European Union (the \"EU Benchmark Regulation\") and Australia (the \"Australia Benchmark Regulation\"). Other jurisdictions are also considering new regulation for financial benchmarks.\nThe EU Benchmark Regulation was published June 30, 2016 and included provisions applicable to Indices and Platts. Both Indices and Platts have established separate benchmark administrators in connection with their benchmark activities in Europe. The Indices and Platts entities are both based in Amsterdam and are authorized by the Dutch Authority for Financial Markets (AFM). This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.\nThe Australian Benchmark Regulation was enacted in June of 2018 and included provisions applicable to Indices, designating the S&P ASX 200 a significant financial benchmark and therefore requiring Indices, as the administrator of the S&P ASX 200, to obtain a license from the Australian Securities and Investment Commission (“ASIC”). Indices has obtained the relevant license. Although narrower in scope, the requirements of the Australian Benchmark Regulation are similar to those of the EU Benchmark Regulation. This legislation will likely cause additional operating obligations but they are not expected to be material at this time, although the exact impact remains unclear.\nIn July of 2013, the IOSCO issued Financial Benchmark Principles (IOSCO Principles), intended to promote the reliability of financial benchmark determinations. The IOSCO Principles address governance, benchmark quality and accountability mechanisms, including with regard to the indices published by Indices. Even though the IOSCO Principles are not binding law,\n52\nTable of Contents\nIndices has taken steps to align its governance regime and operations with the IOSCO Principles and engaged an independent auditor to perform an annual reasonable assurance review of such alignment.\nThe markets for index providers are very competitive. Indices competes domestically and internationally on the basis of a number of factors, including the quality of its benchmark indices, client service, reputation, price, range of products and services (including geographic coverage) and technological innovation.  Our Indices business is impacted by market volatility, asset levels of investment products tracking indices, and trading volumes of certain exchange traded derivatives. Volatile capital markets, as well as changing investment styles, among other factors, may influence an investor’s decision to invest in and maintain an investment in an index-linked investment product.\nFor a further discussion of competitive and other risks inherent in our Indices business, see Item 1A, Risk Factors, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. For a further discussion of the legal and regulatory environment in our Indices business, see Note 13 -\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto the consolidated financial statements under Item 8, Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe continue to maintain a strong financial position. Our primary source of funds for operations is cash from our businesses and our core businesses have been strong cash generators. In 2022, cash on hand, cash flows from operations and availability under our existing credit facility are expected to be sufficient to meet any additional operating and recurring cash needs into the foreseeable future. We use our cash for a variety of needs, including but not limited to: ongoing investments in our businesses, strategic acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends, repayment of debt, capital expenditures and investment in our infrastructure.\nCash Flow Overview\nCash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash were $6.5 billion as of December 31, 2021, an increase of $2.4 billion as compared to December 31, 2020.\nIn 2021 and 2020, free cash flow remained unchanged at $3.3 billion. Free cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. See “Reconciliation of Non-GAAP Financial Information” below for a reconciliation of cash flow provided by operating activities, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, to free cash flow.\nOperating activities\nCash provided by operating activities remained unchanged at $3.6 billion compared to 2020 as higher operating results in 2021 were offset by the acceleration of payments to vendors, higher incentive compensation payments and higher income tax payments.\nCash provided by operating activities increased to $3.6 billion in 2020 as compared to $2.8 billion in 2019. The increase is mainly due to higher results from operations in 2020 and improved cash collections on accounts receivable in 2020.\nInvesting activities\nOur cash outflows from investing activities are primarily for acquisitions and capital expenditures, while cash inflows are primarily proceeds from dispositions.\nCash used for investing activities decreased to $0.1 billion for 2021 as compared to $0.2 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher cash paid for acquisitions in 2020 for the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM and Greenwich Associates LLC.\n53\nTable of Contents\nCash used for investing activities increased to $0.2 billion for 2020 as compared to $0.1 billion in 2019, primarily due to cash used for the acquisitions of the ESG Ratings Business from RobecoSAM and Greenwich Associates LLC in 2020.\nRefer to Note 2 –\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further information.\nFinancing activities\nOur cash outflows from financing activities consist primarily of share repurchases, dividends and repayment of short-term and long-term debt, while cash inflows are primarily inflows from long-term and short-term debt borrowings and proceeds from the exercise of stock options.\nCash used for financing activities decreased to $1.0 billion in 2021 from $2.2 billion in 2020. The decrease is primarily attributable to a decrease in cash used for share repurchases in 2021.\nCash used for financing activities increased to $2.2 billion in 2020 from $1.8 billion in 2019. The increase is primarily attributable to cash used for the redemption and extinguishment of the $900 million outstanding principal amount of our 4.4% senior notes due in 2026 and a portion of the outstanding principal amounts of our 6.55% senior notes due in 2037 and our 4.5% senior notes due in 2048 in 2020, partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of senior notes in 2020. See Note 5\n— Debt\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nDuring 2021, we did not use cash to purchase any shares. We expect to resume share repurchases following the expected closing of the merger with IHS Markit.\nDuring 2020, we used cash to repurchase 4.0 million shares for $1,164 million. We entered into two accelerated share repurchase (\"ASR\") agreements with a financial institution on February 11, 2020  to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million each. We repurchased a total of 1.7 million shares under each ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $292.13 per share.\nDuring 2019, we received 5.9 million shares, including 0.4 million shares received in January of 2019 related to our October 29, 2018 ASR agreement, resulting in $1,240 million of cash used to repurchase shares. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on August 5, 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. We repurchased a total of 2.0 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $253.36 per share. We entered into an ASR agreement with a financial institution on February 11, 2019 to initiate share repurchases aggregating $500 million. We repurchased a total of 2.3 million shares under the ASR agreement for an average purchase price of $214.65 per share.\nOn January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 30 million shares (the \"2020 Repurchase Program\"), which was approximately 12% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of 50 million shares (the \"2013 Repurchase Program\"), which was approximately 18% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. Our purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2021, 30 million shares remained available under the 2020 Repurchase Program and 0.8 million shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program.\nSee Note 9\n— Equity\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, in the Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion related to our ASR agreements.\n54\nTable of Contents\nAdditional Financing\nOn April 26, 2021, we entered into a revolving $1.5 billion five-year credit agreement (our \"credit facility\") that will terminate on April 26, 2026. This credit facility replaced our revolving $1.2 billion five-year credit facility (our \"previous credit facility\") that was scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2022. The previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. There were no outstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced.\nWe have the ability to borrow a total of $1.5 billion through our commercial paper program, which is supported by our credit facility. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no commercial paper issued or outstanding, and we similarly did not draw or have any borrowings outstanding from the credit facility or the previous credit facility during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of 9 basis points. The credit facility also includes an accordion feature which allows the Company to increase the total commitments thereunder by up to an additional $500 million, subject to certain customary terms and conditions. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.\nThe only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than 4 to 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.\nMerger-Related Financing\nOn November 16, 2021, we launched an offer (the “Exchange Offer”) to exchange outstanding notes issued by IHS Markit for new notes issued by us and fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC with the same interest rate, interest payment dates, maturity date and redemption terms as each corresponding series of exchanged IHS Markit notes and cash. The approximately $4.6 billion in aggregate principal amount of IHS Markit’s notes subject to the Exchange Offer range in maturities from 2022 to 2029. The Exchange Offer is conditioned upon closing of the Merger and we expect to extend the Exchange Offer until closing of the Merger.  As of January 26, 2022, 95.83% of the IHS Markit notes had been tendered.\nIn conjunction with the Exchange Offer, we successfully solicited consents to amend each of the indentures governing the IHS Markit notes to, among other things, eliminate certain covenants, restrictive provisions, events of default and the obligation to offer to repurchase the IHS Markit notes upon certain change of control transactions. These amendments become operative upon the settlement of the Exchange Offer.\nFollowing the Merger, we expect to raise additional capital, including by issuing new senior notes of various maturities, potentially ranging from 5 years to 40 years, in an aggregate principal amount up to $6 billion, portions of which we expect to use to refinance existing indebtedness. We also expect to exercise the accordion feature under our existing credit facility to increase the total commitments thereunder by an additional $500 million.\nMerger-Related Costs\nIn 2022, we will continue to incur costs associated with the anticipated merger with IHS Markit including certain transaction costs upon completion of the merger that is expected to close in the first quarter of 2022.\nDividends\nOn January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $0.77 per share. Following the expected closing of the merger with IHS Markit, the Board of Directors will revisit the dividend policy of the combined Company.\n55\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nThe senior notes described below were issued by S&P Global Inc. and are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC, a 100% owned subsidiary of the Company. All senior notes have been registered with the SEC.\n•\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $600 million of 1.25% senior notes due in 2030 and $700 million of 2.3% senior notes due in 2060.\n•\nOn November 26, 2019, we issued $500 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2029 and $600 million of 3.25% senior notes due in 2049.\n•\nOn May 17, 2018, we issued $500 million of 4.5% senior notes due in 2048.\n•\nOn September 22, 2016, we issued $500 million of 2.95% senior notes due in 2027.\n•\nOn May 26, 2015, we issued $700 million of 4.0% senior notes due in 2025.\n•\nOn November 2, 2007 we issued $400 million of 6.55% Senior Notes due 2037.\nThe notes above are unsecured and unsubordinated and rank equally and ratably with all of our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The guarantees are the subsidiary guarantor’s unsecured and unsubordinated debt and rank equally and ratably with all of the subsidiary guarantor’s existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt.\nThe guarantees of the subsidiary guarantor may be released and discharged upon (i) a sale or other disposition (including by way of consolidation or merger) of the subsidiary guarantor or the sale or disposition of all or substantially all the assets of the subsidiary guarantor (in each case other than to the Company or a person who, prior to such sale or other disposition, is an affiliate of the Company); (ii) upon defeasance or discharge of any applicable series of the notes, as described above; or (iii) at such time as the subsidiary guarantor ceases to guarantee indebtedness for borrowed money, other than a discharge through payment thereon, under any Credit Facility of the Company, other than any such Credit Facility of the Company the guarantee of which by the subsidiary guarantor will be released concurrently with the release of the subsidiary guarantor’s guarantees of the notes.\nOther subsidiaries of the Company do not guarantee the registered debt securities of either S&P Global Inc. or Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC (the \"Obligor Group\") which are referred to as the “Non-Obligor Group”.\nThe following tables set forth the summarized financial information of the Obligor Group on a combined basis. This  summarized financial information excludes the Non-Obligor Group. Intercompany balances and transactions between members of the Obligor Group have been eliminated. This information is not intended to present the financial position or results of operations of the Obligor Group in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nSummarized results of operations for the year ended December 31 is as follows:\nSummarized balance sheet information as of December 31 is as follows:\nContractual Obligations\nWe typically have various contractual obligations, which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, while other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts, are not recognized, but are disclosed herein. For example, we are contractually committed to contracts for information-technology outsourcing, certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.\n56\nTable of Contents\nWe believe that the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand, cash flows expected from operations and availability under our credit facility will be adequate for us to execute our business strategy and meet anticipated requirements for lease obligations, capital expenditures, working capital and debt service for 2022.\nThe following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of December 31, 2021, over the next several years. Additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, as referenced in the footnotes to the table:\n1\nOur debt obligations are described in Note 5 –\nDebt\nto our consolidated financial statement.\n2\nSee Note 13 –\nCommitments and Contingencies\nto our consolidated financial statements for further discussion on our operating lease obligations\n.\n3\nOther consists primarily of commitments for unconditional purchase obligations in contracts for information-technology outsourcing and certain enterprise-wide information-technology software licensing and maintenance.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $147 million of liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits. We have excluded the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits from our contractual obligations table because, until formal resolutions are reached, reasonable estimates of the timing of cash settlements with the respective taxing authorities are not practicable.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have recorded $3,429 million for our redeemable noncontrolling interest in our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC partnership discussed in Note 9 –\nEquity\nto our consolidated financial statements.  Specifically, this amount relates to the put option under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, whereby, after December 31, 2017, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (\"CGIS\") has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least 20% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. We have excluded this amount from our contractual obligations table because we are uncertain as to the timing and the ultimate amount of the potential payment we may be required to make.\nWe make contributions to our pension and postretirement plans in order to satisfy minimum funding requirements as well as additional contributions that we consider appropriate to improve the funded status of our plans. During 2021, we contributed $11 million to our retirement plans. Expected employer contributions in 2022 are $11 million and $3 million for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively. In 2022, we may elect to make additional non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status. See Note 7 –\nEmployee Benefits\nto our consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n57\nTable of Contents\nRECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP financial measure and reflects our cash flow provided by operating activities less capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders. Capital expenditures include purchases of property and equipment and additions to technology projects. Our cash flow provided by operating activities is the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure to free cash flow.\nWe believe the presentation of free cash flow allows our investors to evaluate the cash generated from our underlying operations in a manner similar to the method used by management. We use free cash flow to conduct and evaluate our business because we believe it typically presents a more conservative measure of cash flows since capital expenditures and distributions to noncontrolling interest holders are considered a necessary component of ongoing operations. Free cash flow is useful for management and investors because it allows management and investors to evaluate the cash available to us to prepay debt, make strategic acquisitions and investments and repurchase stock.\nThe presentation of free cash flow is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the financial information prepared and presented in accordance with U.S. GAAP. Free cash flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. The following table presents a reconciliation of our cash flow provided by operating activities to free cash flow:\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities.\nOn an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates and assumptions, including those related to revenue recognition, allowance for doubtful accounts, valuation of long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets, pension plans, incentive compensation and stock-based compensation, income taxes, contingencies and redeemable noncontrolling interests. We base our estimates on historical experience, current developments and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under these circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that cannot readily be determined from other sources. There can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates.\nManagement considers an accounting estimate to be critical if it required assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate or different estimates could have a material effect on our results of operations. Management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates with the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors. The Audit Committee has reviewed our disclosure relating to them in this MD&A.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements:\n58\nTable of Contents\nRevenue recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. See Note 1 -\nAccounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements for further information.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators. The impact on operating profit for a one percentage point change in the allowance for doubtful accounts is approximately $17 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we incorporated the forecasted impact of future economic conditions into our allowance for doubtful accounts measurement process including the expected adverse impact of COVID-19 on the global economy. Based on our current outlook these assumptions are not expected to significantly change in 2022.\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets was $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nGoodwill\nAs part of our annual impairment test of our four reporting units, we initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. Reporting units are generally an operating segment or one level below an operating segment. Our qualitative assessment included, but was not limited to, consideration of macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, cash flows, changes in key Company personnel and our share price. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its respective carrying amount we perform a quantitative impairment test. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge. For 2021, based on our qualitative assessments, we determined that it is more likely than not that our reporting units’ fair values were greater than their respective carrying amounts.\nIndefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess. Significant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for this indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial\n59\nTable of Contents\nposition and results of operations.\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that no impairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nRetirement plans and postretirement healthcare and other benefits\nOur employee pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions concerning the outcome of future events and circumstances, including compensation increases, long-term return on pension plan assets, discount rates and other factors. In determining such assumptions, we consult with outside actuaries and other advisors where deemed appropriate. In accordance with relevant accounting standards, if actual results differ from our assumptions, such differences are deferred and amortized over the estimated remaining lifetime of the plan participants. While we believe that the assumptions used in these calculations are reasonable, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions could affect the expense and liabilities related to our pension and other postretirement benefits.\nThe following is a discussion of some significant assumptions that we make in determining costs and obligations for pension and other postretirement benefits:\n•\nDiscount rate assumptions are based on current yields on high-grade corporate long-term bonds.\n•\nThe expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term.\nOur discount rate and return on asset assumptions used to determine the net periodic pension and postretirement benefit cost on our U.S. retirement plans are as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $1.5 billion in pension benefit obligation. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would result in an estimated decrease or increase to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $50 million and an increase or decrease in 2022 pension expense of approximately $1 million. An increase or decrease of 1 percentage point in the expected rate of return on plan assets would result in a decrease or increase of approximately $15 million to 2022 pension expense.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in our consolidated statements of income. There were no stock options granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.\nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2022. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.\n60\nTable of Contents\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $2.9 billion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $0.8 billion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.\nContingencies\nWe are subject to a number of lawsuits and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business. We recognize a liability for such contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record its best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may have been incurred.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nThe fair value component of the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business is based on a combination of an income and market valuation approach. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $3.4 billion in redeemable noncontrolling interest on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The ultimate amount paid for the redeemable noncontrolling interest in Indices business could be significantly different because the redemption amount depends on the future results of operations of the business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the weighted average cost of capital used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 9%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the weighted average cost of capital would decrease or increase the redemption value by approximately $80 million. As of December 31, 2021, the terminal growth rate used in the Company's income analysis to estimate the fair value of the redeemable noncontrolling interest was 2.2%. A 0.25 percentage point increase or decrease in the terminal growth rate would increase or decrease the redemption value by approximately $50 million.\nRECENT\nACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Note 1 –\nAccounting Policies\nto our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of recent accounting standards. We do not expect these recent accounting standards to have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity in future periods."

We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing.

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 8, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\n63\nTable of Contents\n/s/\nERNST & YOUNG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1969.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 8, 2022\n64\nTable of Contents\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of S&P Global Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited S&P Global Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, S&P Global Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 8, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\nERNST & YOUNG LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 8, 2022\n65\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n66\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n67\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n68\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n69\nTable of Contents\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\n1\nExcludes $\n215\nmillion, $\n181\nmillion and $\n170\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, attributable to redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nSee accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n70\nTable of Contents\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\n1.\nAccounting Policies\nNature of operations\nS&P Global Inc. (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, the “Company,” the “Registrant,” “we,” “us” or “our”) is a leading  provider of transparent and independent ratings, benchmarks, analytics and data to the capital and commodity markets worldwide. The capital markets include asset managers, investment banks, commercial banks, insurance companies, exchanges, trading firms and issuers; and the commodity markets include producers, traders and intermediaries within energy, petrochemicals, metals and agriculture.\nOur operations consist of\nfour\nreportable segments: S&P Global Ratings (\"Ratings\"), S&P Global Market Intelligence (\"Market Intelligence\"), S&P Global Platts (\"Platts\") and S&P Dow Jones Indices (\"Indices\").\n•\nRatings is an independent provider of credit ratings, research and analytics, offering investors and other market participants information, ratings and benchmarks.\n•\nMarket Intelligence is a global provider of multi-asset-class data, research and analytical capabilities, which integrate cross-asset analytics and desktop services.\n•\nPlatts is the leading independent provider of information and benchmark prices for the commodity and energy markets.\n•\nIndices is a global index provider that maintains a wide variety of valuation and index benchmarks for investment advisors, wealth managers and institutional investors.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.\nSubscription revenue\nSubscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily derived from distribution of data, analytics, third party research, and credit ratings-related information primarily through web-based channels including Market Intelligence Desktop, RatingsDirect®, RatingsXpress®, and Credit Analytics. Subscription revenue at Platts is generated by providing customers access to commodity and energy-related price assessments, market data, and real-time news, along with other information services. Subscription revenue at Indices is derived from the contracts for underlying data of our indexes to support our customers' management of index funds, portfolio analytics, and research.\nFor subscription products and services, we generally provide continuous access to dynamic data sets and analytics for a defined period, with revenue recognized ratably as our performance obligation to provide access to our data and analytics is progressively fulfilled over the stated term of the contract.\nNon-transaction revenue\nNon-transaction revenue at Ratings is primarily related to surveillance of a credit rating, annual fees for customer relationship-based pricing programs, fees for entity credit ratings and global research and analytics at CRISIL. Non-transaction revenue also includes an intersegment revenue elimination of $\n146\nmillion, $\n137\nmillion and $\n128\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively, mainly consisting of the royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.\nFor non-transaction revenue related to Rating’s surveillance services, we continuously monitor factors that impact the creditworthiness of an issuer over the contractual term with revenue recognized to the extent that our performance obligation is progressively fulfilled over the term contract. Because surveillance services are continuously provided throughout the term of the contract, our measure of progress towards fulfillment of our obligation to monitor a rating is a time-based output measure with revenue recognized ratably over the term of the contract.\nNon-subscription / Transaction revenue\nTransaction revenue at our Ratings segment primarily includes fees associated with:\n•\nratings related to new issuance of corporate and government debt instruments; as well as structured finance instruments; and\n71\nTable of Contents\n•\nbank loan ratings.\nTransaction revenue is recognized at the point in time when our performance obligation is satisfied by issuing a rating on our customer's instruments and when we have a right to payment and the customer can benefit from the significant risks and rewards of ownership.\nNon-subscription revenue at Market Intelligence is primarily related to certain advisory, pricing and analytical services. Non-subscription revenue at Platts is primarily related to conference sponsorship, consulting engagements and events.\nAsset-linked fees\nAsset-linked fees at Indices and Market Intelligence are primarily related to royalties payments based on the value of assets under management in our customers exchange-traded funds and mutual funds.\nFor asset-linked products and services, we provide licenses conveying continuous access to our index and benchmark-related intellectual property during a specified contract term. Revenue is recognized when the extent that our customers have used our licensed intellectual property can be quantified. Recognition of revenue for our asset-linked fee arrangements is subject to the \"recognition constraint\" for usage-based royalty payments because we cannot reasonably predict the value of the assets that will be invested in index funds structured using our intellectual property until it is either publicly available or when we are notified by our customers. Revenue derived from an asset-linked fee arrangement is measured and recognized when the certainty of the extent of its utilization of our index products by our customers is known.\nSales usage-based royalties\nSales usage-based royalty revenue at our Indices segment is primarily related to trading based fees from exchange-traded derivatives. Sales and usage-based royalty revenue at our Platts segment is primarily related to licensing of its proprietary market price data and price assessments to commodity exchanges.\nFor sales usage-based royalty products and services, we provide licenses conveying the right to continuous access to our intellectual property over the contract term, with revenue recognized when the extent of our license’s utilization can be quantified, or more specifically, when trading volumes are known and publicly available to us or when we are notified by our customers. Recognition of revenue of fees tied to trading volumes is subject to the recognition constraint for a usage-based royalty promised by our customers in exchange for the license of our intellectual property, with revenue recognized when trading volumes are known.\nArrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations\nOur contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. Revenue relating to agreements that provide for more than one performance obligation is recognized based upon the relative fair value to the customer of each service component as each component is earned. The fair value of the service components are determined using an analysis that considers cash consideration that would be received for instances when the service components are sold separately. If the fair value to the customer for each service is not objectively determinable, we make our best estimate of the services’ stand-alone selling price and record revenue as it is earned over the service period.\nReceivables\nWe record a receivable when a customer is billed or when revenue is recognized prior to billing a customer. For multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning of each annual period.\nContract Assets\nContract assets include unbilled amounts from when the Company transfers service to a customer before a customer pays consideration or before payment is due. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, contract assets were $\n9\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively, and are included in accounts receivable in our consolidated balance sheets.\nUnearned Revenue\nWe record unearned revenue when cash payments are received in advance of our performance. The increase in the unearned revenue balance for the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily driven by cash payments received in advance of satisfying our performance obligations, offset by $\n2.1\nbillion of revenues recognized that were included in the unearned revenue balance at the beginning of the period.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price of contracts for work that has not yet been performed. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations was $\n2.7\n72\nTable of Contents\nbillion. We expect to recognize revenue on approximately half and three-quarters of the remaining performance obligations over the next\n12\nand\n24\nmonths, respectively, with the remainder recognized thereafter.\nWe do not disclose the value of unfulfilled performance obligations for (i) contracts with an original expected length of one year or less and (ii) contracts where revenue is a usage-based royalty promised in exchange for a license of intellectual property.\nCosts to Obtain a Contract\nWe recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We have determined that the costs associated with certain sales commission programs are incremental to the costs to obtain contracts with customers and therefore meet the criteria to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were $\n137\nmillion and $\n129\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, and are included in prepaid and other current assets and other non-current assets on our consolidated balance sheets.The capitalized asset will be amortized over a period consistent with the transfer to the customer of the goods or services to which the asset relates, calculated based on the customer term and the average life of the products and services underlying the contracts which has been determined to be approximately\n5\nyears. The expense is recorded within selling and general expenses.\nWe expense sales commissions when incurred if the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling and general expenses.\nOther (Income) Expense, net\nThe components of other (income) expense, net for the year ended December 31 are as follows:\n1\nThe net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans for the year ended December 31, 2020 includes a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $\n3\nmillion. During the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed a portion of the Company's obligation to pay pension benefits to the plan's beneficiaries. The net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and post retirement plans for the year ended December 31, 2019 includes a non-cash pre-tax settlement charge of $\n113\nmillion reflecting the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nAssets and Liabilities Held for Sale\nWe classify a disposal group to be sold as held for sale in the period in which all of the following criteria are met: management, having the authority to approve the action, commits to a plan to sell the disposal group; the disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject only to terms that are usual and customary for sales of such disposal group; an active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the plan to sell the disposal group have been initiated; the sale of the disposal group is probable, and transfer of the disposal group is expected to qualify for recognition as a completed sale within one year, except if events or circumstances beyond our control extend the period of time required to sell the disposal group beyond one year; the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and actions required to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nA disposal group that is classified as held for sale is initially measured at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell. Any loss resulting from this measurement is recognized in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Conversely, gains are not recognized on the sale of a disposal group until the date of sale.\nThe fair value of a disposal group less any costs to sell is assessed each reporting period it remains classified as held for sale and any subsequent changes are reported as an adjustment to the carrying value of the disposal group, as long as the new carrying value does not exceed the carrying value of the disposal group at the time it was initially classified as held for sale. Upon determining that a disposal group meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale, the Company reports the assets and liabilities of the disposal group as held for sale in the current period in our consolidated balance sheets.\n73\nTable of Contents\nDiscontinued Operations\nIn determining whether a disposal of a component of an entity or a group of components of an entity is required to be presented as a discontinued operation, we make a determination whether the disposal represents a strategic shift that had, or will have, a major effect on our operations and financial results. A component of an entity comprises operations and cash flows that can be clearly distinguished both operationally and for financial reporting purposes.  If we conclude that the disposal represents a strategic shift, then the results of operations of the group of assets being disposed of (as well as any gain or loss on the disposal transaction) are aggregated for separate presentation apart from our continuing operating results in the consolidated financial statements.\nPrinciples of consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of all subsidiaries and our share of earnings or losses of joint ventures and affiliated companies under the equity method of accounting. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nCash and cash equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include ordinary bank deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less that consist primarily of money market funds with unrestricted daily liquidity and fixed term time deposits. Such investments and bank deposits are stated at cost, which approximates market value, and were $\n6.5\nbillion and $\n4.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These investments are not subject to significant market risk.\nRestricted cash\nCash that is subject to legal restrictions or is unavailable for general operating purposes is classified as restricted cash.\nRestricted cash included in our consolidated balance sheets was $\n8\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on deposit under contractual agreements in connection with certain acquisitions and dispositions.\nShort-term investments\nShort-term investments are securities with original maturities greater than 90 days that are available for use in our operations in the next twelve months. The short-term investments, primarily consisting of certificates of deposit and mutual funds, are classified as held-to-maturity and therefore are carried at cost. Interest and dividends are recorded in income when earned.\nAccounts receivable\nCredit is extended to customers based upon an evaluation of the customer’s financial condition. Accounts receivable, which include billings consistent with terms of contractual arrangements, are recorded at net realizable value.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nThe allowance for doubtful accounts reserve methodology is based on historical analysis, a review of outstanding balances and current conditions, and by incorporating data points that provide indicators of future economic conditions including forecasted industry default rates and industry index benchmarks. In determining these reserves, we consider, amongst other factors, the financial condition and risk profile of our customers, areas of specific or concentrated risk as well as applicable industry trends or market indicators.\nCapitalized technology costs\nWe capitalize certain software development and website implementation costs. Capitalized costs only include incremental, direct costs of materials and services incurred to develop the software after the preliminary project stage is completed, funding has been committed and it is probable that the project will be completed and used to perform the function intended. Incremental costs are expenditures that are out-of-pocket to us and are not part of an allocation or existing expense base. Software development and website implementation costs are expensed as incurred during the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs are amortized from the year the software is ready for its intended use over its estimated useful life,\nthree\nto\nseven years\n, using the straight-line method. Periodically, we evaluate the amortization methods, remaining lives and recoverability of such costs. Capitalized software development and website implementation costs are included in other non-current assets and are presented net of accumulated amortization.\nGross capitalized technology costs were $\n216\nmillion and $\n209\nmillion as of December 31,\n74\nTable of Contents\n2021 and 2020, respectively. Accumulated amortization of capitalized technology costs was $\n173\nmillion and $\n150\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFair Value\nCertain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value and classified within a fair value hierarchy based on inputs used when measuring fair value. We have foreign exchange forward contracts, cross currency and interest rate swaps that are adjusted to fair value on a recurring basis.\nOther financial instruments, including cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments, are recorded at cost, which approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity and highly liquid nature of these instruments.\nThe fair value of our long-term debt borrowings were $\n4.4\nbillion and $\n4.6\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.\nAccounting for the impairment of long-lived assets (including other intangible assets)\nWe evaluate long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Upon such an occurrence, recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to current forecasts of undiscounted future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset. For long-lived assets held for sale, assets are written down to fair value, less cost to sell. Fair value is determined based on market evidence, discounted cash flows, appraised values or management’s estimates, depending upon the nature of the assets.\nLeases\nWe determine whether an arrangement meets the criteria for an operating lease or a finance lease at the inception of the arrangement.  We have operating leases for office space and equipment. Our leases have remaining lease terms of\n1\nyear to\n12\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to\n12\nyears, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within\n1\nyear. We consider these options in determining the lease term used to establish our right-of use (\"ROU\") assets and associated lease liabilities. We sublease certain real estate leases to third parties which mainly consist of operating leases for space within our offices.\nLeases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; we recognize lease expenses for these leases on a straight line-basis over the lease term in operating-related expenses and selling and general expenses.\nOperating lease ROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. Our future minimum based payments used to determine our lease liabilities include minimum based rent payments and escalations. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our estimated incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nGoodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter each year, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. We have\nfour\nreporting units with goodwill that are evaluated for impairment.\nWe initially perform a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred or exist that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount. If, based on our evaluation we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than its carrying amount, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the fair value of any of our reporting units is less than their respective carrying amounts we perform a quantitative impairment test.\nWhen conducting our impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of goodwill at the reporting unit level, the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill. Fair value of the reporting units are estimated using the income approach, which incorporates the use of the discounted free cash flow (“DCF”) analyses and are corroborated using the market approach, which incorporates the use of revenue and earnings multiples based on market data. The DCF analyses are based on the current operating budgets and estimated long-term growth projections for each reporting unit. Future cash flows are discounted based on a market comparable weighted average cost of capital rate for each reporting unit, adjusted for market and other risks where appropriate. In addition, we analyze any difference between the sum of the fair values of the\n75\nTable of Contents\nreporting units and our total market capitalization for reasonableness, taking into account certain factors including control premiums. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value, the difference is recognized as an impairment charge.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of indefinite-lived intangible assets by first performing a qualitative analysis evaluating whether any events and circumstances occurred that provide evidence that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired. If, based on our evaluation of the events and circumstances that occurred during the year we do not believe that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, no quantitative impairment test is performed. Conversely, if the results of our qualitative assessment determine that it is more likely than not that the indefinite-lived asset is impaired, a quantitative impairment test is performed. If necessary, an impairment analysis is performed using the income approach to estimate the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the intangible asset carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to that excess.\nSignificant judgments inherent in these analyses include estimating the amount and timing of future cash flows and the selection of appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and long-term growth rate assumptions. Changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value for each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset and could result in an impairment charge, which could be material to our financial position and results of operations.\nWe performed our impairment assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and concluded that\nno\nimpairment existed for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nForeign currency translation\nWe have operations in many foreign countries. For most international operations, the local currency is the functional currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the United States (\"U.S.\") dollar is the functional currency. For local currency operations, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using end of period exchange rates, and revenue and expenses are translated into U.S. dollars using weighted-average exchange rates. Foreign currency translation adjustments are accumulated in a separate component of equity.\nDepreciation\nThe costs of property and equipment are depreciated using the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives: buildings and improvements from\n15\nto\n40\nyears and equipment and furniture from\n2\nto\n10\nyears. The costs of leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the useful lives or the terms of the respective leases.\nAdvertising expense\nThe cost of advertising is expensed as incurred.\nWe incurred $\n39\nmillion, $\n29\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion in advertising costs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock-based compensation\nStock-based compensation expense is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized over the requisite service period, which typically is the vesting period. Stock-based compensation is classified as both operating-related expense and selling and general expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nThere were no stock options granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIncome taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to be applied to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in income tax returns. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are recognized in interest expense and operating expense, respectively.\nJudgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities and unrecognized tax benefits. In determining the need for a valuation allowance, the historical and projected financial performance of the operation that is recording a net deferred tax asset is considered along with any other pertinent information.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be\n76\nTable of Contents\nsettled prior to December 31, 2022. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $\n2.9\nbillion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $\n0.8\nbillion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interest\nThe agreement with the minority partners of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by our minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Since redemption of the noncontrolling interest is outside of our control, this interest is presented on our consolidated balance sheets under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest.” If the interest were to be redeemed, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and  market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches incorporate Level 3 measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.\nSee Note 9 –\nEquity\nfor further detail.\nContingencies\nWe accrue for loss contingencies when both (a) information available prior to issuance of the consolidated financial statements indicates that it is probable that a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and (b) the amount of loss can reasonably be estimated. We continually assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies, as well as potential amounts or ranges of probable losses, and recognize a liability, if any, for these contingencies based on an analysis of each matter with the assistance of outside legal counsel and, if applicable, other experts. Because many of these matters are resolved over long periods of time, our estimate of liabilities may change due to new developments, changes in assumptions or changes in our strategy related to the matter. When we accrue for loss contingencies and the reasonable estimate of the loss is within a range, we record our best estimate within the range. We disclose an estimated possible loss or a range of loss when it is at least reasonably possible that a loss may be incurred.\n77\nTable of Contents\nRecent Accounting Standards\nIn October of 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued guidance that amends the acquirer's accounting for contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers in a business combination in accordance with Topic 606. The guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022; however, early adoption is permitted. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn August of 2020, the FASB issued guidance that amends the accounting for convertible instruments and the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity. The guidance was effective on January 1, 2021, and the adoption of this guidance did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn March of 2020, the FASB issued accounting guidance to provide temporary optional expedients and exceptions to the current contract modifications and hedge accounting guidance in light of the expected market transition from London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") to alternative rates. The new guidance provides optional expedients and exceptions to transactions affected by reference rate reform if certain criteria are met. The transactions primarily include (1) contract modifications, (2) hedging relationships, and (3) sale or transfer of debt securities classified as held-to-maturity. The amendments were effective immediately upon issuance of the update. The Company may elect to adopt the amendments prospectively to transactions existing as of or entered into from the date of adoption through December 31, 2022. The FASB further issued guidance in January of 2021, to clarify the scope of Topic 848. We do not expect this guidance to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn January of 2020, the FASB intended to clarify the interaction of the accounting for equity securities under Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 321, investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting under ASC 323, and the accounting for certain forward contracts and purchased options accounted for under ASC 815. The guidance clarifies how to account for the transition into and out of the equity method of accounting when considering observable transactions under the measurement alternative.

The agreement represents continued progress toward completing the pending merger of S&P Global and IHS Markit, and the divestiture is dependent on expected closing of the merger with IHS Markit and other customary conditions. We have also pledged to divest our Leveraged Commentary and Data (“LCD”) business, included in our Market Intelligence segment, along with a related family of leveraged loan indices as a condition for regulatory approval. Under the European Commission's conditional approval of the merger of S&P Global and IHS Markit, execution of an agreement to sell the LCD business can occur after the closing of the merger. The divestitures remain subject to further review and approval by antitrust regulators. Subject to certain closing conditions, the merger is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the following dispositions that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n11\nmillion, which was included in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n8\nmillion ($\n6\nmillion after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income related to the sale of office facilities in India.\n•\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n3\nmillion ($\n3\nmillion after-tax) in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statements of income related to the sale of Standard & Poor's Investment Advisory Services LLC (\"SPIAS\"), a business within our Market Intelligence segment, that occurred in July of 2019.\n2020\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed the following dispositions that resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n16\nmillion, which was included in Gain on dispositions in the consolidated statement of income:\n•\nIn January of 2020, Market Intelligence entered into a strategic alliance to transition S&P Global Market Intelligence's Investor Relations (\"IR\") webhosting business to Q4 Inc.

The weighted-average life of the intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 is approximately\n12\nyears.\nAmortization expense was $\n96\nmillion, $\n123\nmillion and $\n122\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nExpected amortization expense for intangible assets over the next five years for the years ended December 31, assuming no further acquisitions or dispositions, is as follows:\n1\nAmortization expense does not include the expected merger with IHS Markit which is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022.\n83\nTable of Contents\n4.\nTaxes on Income\nIncome before taxes on income resulting from domestic and foreign operations is as follows:\nThe provision for taxes on income consists of the following:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to our effective income tax rate for financial reporting purposes is as follows:\nThe increase in the effective income tax rate in 2021 was primarily due to a change in the mix of income by jurisdiction. The increase in the effective income tax rate in 2020 was primarily due to a decrease in the recognition of excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments in the statement of income.\nWe have elected to recognize the tax on Global Intangible Low Taxed Income (“GILTI”) as a period expense in the year the tax is incurred. GILTI expense is included in Other, net above.\n84\nTable of Contents\nThe principal temporary differences between the accounting for income and expenses for financial reporting and income tax purposes are as follows:\nWe record valuation allowances against deferred income tax assets when we determine that it is more likely than not that such deferred income tax assets will not be realized based upon all the available evidence. The valuation allowance is primarily related to operating losses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have approximately $\n2.9\nbillion of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries, of which $\n0.8\nbillion is reinvested indefinitely in our foreign operations. We have not recorded deferred income taxes applicable to undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries that are indefinitely reinvested in foreign operations. Quantification of the deferred tax liability, if any, associated with indefinitely reinvested earnings is not practicable.\nWe made net income tax payments totaling $\n883\nmillion in 2021, $\n683\nmillion in 2020, and $\n659\nmillion in 2019. As of December 31, 2021, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $\n761\nmillion, of which a significant portion has an unlimited carryover period under current law.\n85\nTable of Contents\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe total amount of federal, state and local, and foreign unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n147\nmillion, $\n121\nmillion and $\n124\nmillion, respectively, exclusive of interest and penalties. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the change in unrecognized tax benefits resulted in a net increase of tax expense of $\n31\nmillion.\nWe recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating-related expense, respectively. Based on the current status of income tax audits, we believe that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits on the balance sheet may be reduced by up to approximately $\n16\nmillion in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of local tax examinations. In addition to the unrecognized tax benefits, we had $\n24\nmillion as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020 of accrued interest and penalties associated with unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe U.S. federal income tax audits for 2017 through 2021 are in process. During 2021, we completed state and foreign tax audits and, with few exceptions, we are no longer subject to federal, state, or foreign income tax examinations by tax authorities for the years before 2013. The impact to tax expense in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was not material.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions, and we are routinely under audit by many different tax authorities. We believe that our accrual for tax liabilities is adequate for all open audit years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of complex judgments about future events. It is possible that tax examinations will be settled prior to December 31, 2022. If any of these tax audit settlements do occur within that period, we would make any necessary adjustments to the accrual for unrecognized tax benefits.\n5.\nDebt\nA summary of long-term debt outstanding is as follows:\n1\nInterest payments are due semiannually on June 15 and December 15, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n4\nmillion.\n2\nInterest payments are due semiannually on January 22 and July 22, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n4\nmillion.\n3\nInterest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n4\nmillion\n.\n86\nTable of Contents\n4\nInterest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n7\nmillion.\n5\nInterest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n3\nmillion.\n6\nInterest payments are due semiannually on May 15 and November 15, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n10\nmillion\n.\n7\nInterest payments are due semiannually on June 1 and December 1, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n11\nmillion.\n8\nInterest payments are due semiannually on February 15 and August 15, and as of December 31, 2021, the unamortized debt discount and issuance costs total $\n19\nmillion.\nAnnual debt maturities are scheduled as follows based on book values as of December 31, 2021:\nno\namounts due in 2022, 2023, or 2024; $\n696\nmillion due in 2025;\nno\namounts due in 2026; and $\n3.4\nbillion due thereafter.\nOn April 26, 2021, we entered into a revolving $\n1.5\nbillion\nfive-year\ncredit agreement (our \"credit facility\") that will terminate on April 26, 2026. This credit facility replaced our revolving $\n1.2\nbillion\nfive-year\ncredit facility (our \"previous credit facility\") that was scheduled to terminate on June 30, 2022. The previous credit facility was canceled immediately after the new credit facility became effective. There were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the previous credit facility when it was replaced.\nOn August 13, 2020, we issued $\n600\nmillion of\n1.25\n% senior notes due in 2030 and $\n700\nmillion of\n2.3\n% senior notes due in 2060. The notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by our wholly-owned subsidiary, Standard & Poor's Financial Services LLC.

As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, there was no commercial paper issued or outstanding, and we similarly did not draw or have any borrowings outstanding from the credit facility or the previous credit facility during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nCommitment fees for the unutilized commitments under the credit facility and applicable margins for borrowings thereunder are linked to the Company achieving three environmental sustainability performance indicators related to emissions, tested annually. We currently pay a commitment fee of\n9\nbasis points. The credit facility also includes an accordion feature which allows the Company to increase the total commitments thereunder by up to an additional $\n500\nmillion, subject to certain customary terms and conditions. The credit facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants and customary events of default. The occurrence of an event of default could result in an acceleration of the obligations under the credit facility.\nThe only financial covenant required under our credit facility is that our indebtedness to cash flow ratio, as defined in our credit facility, was not greater than\n4\nto 1, and this covenant level has never been exceeded.\n87\nTable of Contents\n6.\nDerivative Instruments\nOur exposure to market risk includes changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. We have operations in foreign countries where the functional currency is primarily the local currency. For international operations that are determined to be extensions of the parent company, the U.S. dollar is the functional currency. We typically have naturally hedged positions in most countries from a local currency perspective with offsetting assets and liabilities. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, we have entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to mitigate or hedge the effect of adverse fluctuations in foreign exchange rates and cross currency swap contracts to hedge a portion of our net investment in a foreign subsidiary against volatility in foreign exchange rates.  During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing. These contracts are recorded at fair value that is based on foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates in active markets; therefore, we classify these derivative contracts within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy. We do not enter into any derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.\nUndesignated Derivative Instruments\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts in order to mitigate the change in fair value of specific assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These forward contracts do not qualify for hedge accounting. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the aggregate notional value of these outstanding forward contracts was $\n376\nmillion and $\n460\nmillion, respectively. The changes in fair value of these forward contracts are recorded in prepaid and other assets or other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet with their corresponding change in fair value recognized in selling and general expenses in the consolidated statement of income. The amount recorded in prepaid and other current assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n5\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion, respectively. The amount recorded in other current liabilities was less than $\n1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n2\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. The amount recorded in selling and general expense for the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 related to these contracts was a net loss $\n9\nmillion and a net gain of $\n9\nmillion, respectively.\nNet Investment Hedges\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we entered into cross currency swaps to hedge a portion of our net investment in one of our European subsidiaries against volatility in the Euro/U.S. dollar exchange rate. These swaps are designated and qualify as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign subsidiary and are scheduled to mature in 2024, 2029, 2030. The notional value of our outstanding cross currency swaps designated as a net investment hedge was $\n1\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in the fair value of swaps are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of other comprehensive income (loss), and reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet. The gain or loss will be subsequently reclassified into net earnings when the hedged net investment is either sold or substantially liquidated. We have elected to assess the effectiveness of our net investment hedges based on changes in spot exchange rates. Accordingly, amounts related to the cross currency swaps recognized directly in net income represent net periodic interest settlements and accruals, which are recognized in interest expense, net. We recognized net interest income of $\n20\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash Flow Hedges\nForeign Exchange Forward Contracts\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we entered into a series of foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge a portion of the Indian rupee, British pound, and Euro exposures through the fourth quarter of 2023, 2022 and 2020 respectively. These contracts are intended to offset the impact of movement of exchange rates on future revenue and operating costs and are scheduled to mature within\ntwenty-four months\n. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and are subsequently reclassified into revenue and selling and general expenses in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we estimate that $\n6\nmillion of pre-tax gain related to foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income is expected to be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve months.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts designated as cash flow hedges was $\n498\nmillion and $\n489\nmillion, respectively.\n88\nTable of Contents\nInterest Rate Swaps\nDuring the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we entered into a series of interest rate swaps. These contracts are intended to mitigate or hedge the adverse fluctuations in interest rates on our future debt refinancing and are scheduled to mature beginning in the first quarter of 2027. These interest rate swaps are designated as cash flow hedges. The changes in the fair value of these contracts are initially reported in accumulated other comprehensive loss in our consolidated balance sheet and will be subsequently reclassified into interest expense, net in the same period that the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the aggregate notional value of our outstanding interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges was $\n2.3\nbillion.\nThe following table provides information on the location and fair value amounts of our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020:\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of pre-tax gains (losses) on our cash flow hedges and net investment hedges for the years ended December 31:\n89\nTable of Contents\nThe activity related to the change in unrealized gains (losses) in accumulated other comprehensive loss was as follows for the years ended December 31:\n7.\nEmployee Benefits\nWe maintain a number of active defined contribution retirement plans for our employees. The majority of our defined benefit plans are frozen. As a result, no new employees will be permitted to enter these plans and no additional benefits for current participants in the frozen plans will be accrued.\nWe also have supplemental benefit plans that provide senior management with supplemental retirement, disability and death benefits. Certain supplemental retirement benefits are based on final monthly earnings. In addition, we sponsor a voluntary 401(k) plan under which we may match employee contributions up to certain levels of compensation as well as profit-sharing plans under which we contribute a percentage of eligible employees' compensation to the employees' accounts.\nWe also provide certain medical, dental and life insurance benefits for active and retired employees and eligible dependents. The medical and dental plans and supplemental life insurance plan are contributory, while the basic life insurance plan is noncontributory. We currently do not prefund any of these plans.\nWe recognize the funded status of our retirement and postretirement plans in the consolidated balance sheets, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of taxes. The amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss represent net unrecognized actuarial losses and unrecognized prior service costs. These amounts will be subsequently recognized as net periodic pension cost pursuant to our accounting policy for amortizing such amounts.\nNet periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans other than the service cost component are included in other (income) expense, net in our consolidated statements of income.\n90\nTable of Contents\nBenefit Obligation\nA summary of the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets, as well as the funded status for the retirement and postretirement plans as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, is as follows (benefits paid in the table below include only those amounts contributed directly to or paid directly from plan assets):\n1\nThe actuarial gain in 2021 compared to the actuarial loss in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in the discount rate.\n2\nRelates to the impact of a plan amendment in 2021.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nFor purposes of determining annual pension cost, prior service costs are being amortized straight-line over the average expected remaining lifetime of plan participants expected to receive benefits.\n91\nTable of Contents\nA summary of net periodic benefit cost for our retirement and postretirement plans for the years ended December 31,  is as follows:\n1\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.K. pension plan, triggering the recognition of  non-cash pre-tax settlement charges of $\n3\nmillion.\n2\nRelates to the impact of a retiree annuity purchase in 2019. The Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed a portion of the Company's obligation to pay pension benefits to the plan's beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded by pension plan assets. The non-cash pretax settlement charge reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.\nOur U.K. retirement plan accounted for a benefit of $\n22\nmillion in 2021, $\n17\nmillion in 2020 and $\n14\nmillion in 2019 of the net periodic benefit cost attributable to the funded plans.\nOther changes in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax for the years ended   December 31, are as follows:\n1\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, lump sum withdrawals exceeded the combined total anticipated annual service and interest cost of our U.K. pension plan, triggering the recognition of non-cash pre-tax settlement charges of $\n3\nmillion.\n2\nRelates to the impact of a retiree annuity purchase in 2019. The Company purchased a group annuity contract under which an insurance company assumed a portion of the Company's obligation to pay pension benefits to the plan's beneficiaries. The purchase of this group annuity contract was funded by pension plan assets. The non-cash after tax settlement charge reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of unamortized actuarial losses in the plan.\nThe total cost for our retirement plans was $\n93\nmillion for 2021, $\n91\nmillion for 2020 and $\n187\nmillion for 2019. The total cost for our retirement plans in 2019 includes the $\n113\nmillion settlement charge related to the retiree annuity purchase in 2019. Included in the total retirement plans cost are defined contribution plans cost of $\n86\nmillion for 2021, $\n80\nmillion for 2020 and $\n73\nmillion for 2019.\n92\nTable of Contents\nAssumptions\n1\nThe health care cost trend rate no longer applies since all subsidized benefits subject to trend were eliminated in 2021.\n2\nEffective January 1, 2021, we changed our discount rate assumption on our U.S. retirement plans to\n2.75\n% from\n3.45\n% in 2020 and changed our discount rate assumption on our U.K. plan to\n1.36\n% from\n1.92\n% in 2020.\n3\nThe expected return on assets assumption is calculated based on the plan’s asset allocation strategy and projected market returns over the long-term. Effective January 1, 2022, our return on assets assumption for the U.S. plan was reduced to\n4.00\n% from\n5.00\n% and the U.K. plan was reduced to\n5.00\n% from\n5.50\n%.\nCash Flows\nIn December of 2003, the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003 (the “Act”) was enacted. The Act established a prescription drug benefit under Medicare, known as “Medicare Part D”, and a federal subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans that provide a benefit that is at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D. Our benefits provided to certain participants are at least actuarially equivalent to Medicare Part D, and, accordingly, we are entitled to a subsidy. Effective January 1, 2021, we elected to no longer file for Medicare Part D subsidy.\nExpected employer contributions in 2022 are $\n11\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion for our retirement and postretirement plans, respectively.\nIn 2022, we may elect to make non-required contributions depending on investment performance and the pension plan status.\nInformation about the expected cash flows for our retirement and postretirement plans is as follows:\n1\nReflects the total benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants’ share of the cost.\n2\nReflects the total benefits expected to be paid from our assets.\n93\nTable of Contents\nFair Value of Plan Assets\nIn accordance with authoritative guidance for fair value measurements certain assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value. Fair value is defined as the amount that would be received for selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. A fair value hierarchy has been established which requires us to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The three levels of inputs used to measure fair value are as follows:\n•\nLevel 1 - Unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities; quoted prices in markets that are not active; or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe fair value of our defined benefit plans assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, by asset class is as follows:\n94\nTable of Contents\n1\nIncludes securities that are tracked in the S&P Smallcap 600 index.\n2\nIncludes securities that are mainly investment grade obligations of issuers in the U.S.\n3\nIncludes a fund which holds real estate properties in the U.K.\n4\nIncludes funds that invest in global infrastructure for the UK Pension.\n5\nIncludes the Standard & Poor's 500 Composite Stock Index, the Standard & Poor's MidCap 400 Composite Stock Index, a short-term investment fund which is a common collective trust vehicle, and other various asset classes.\nFor securities that are quoted in active markets, the trustee/custodian determines fair value by applying securities’ prices obtained from its pricing vendors. For commingled funds that are not actively traded, the trustee applies pricing information provided by investment management firms to the unit quantities of such funds. Investment management firms employ their own pricing vendors to value the securities underlying each commingled fund. Underlying securities that are not actively traded derive their prices from investment managers, which in turn, employ vendors that use pricing models (e.g., discounted cash flow, comparables). The domestic defined benefit plans have no investment in our stock, except through the S&P 500 commingled trust index fund.\nThe trustee obtains estimated prices from vendors for securities that are not easily quotable and they are categorized accordingly as Level 3.\nThe following table details further information on our plan assets where we have used significant unobservable inputs:\nPension Trusts’ Asset Allocations\nThere are\ntwo\npension trusts,\none\nin the U.S. and\none\nin the U.K.\n•\nThe U.S. pension trust had assets of $\n1,600\nmillion and $\n1,630\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 respectively, and the target allocations in 2021 include\n92\n% fixed income,\n4\n% domestic equities,\n2\n% international equities and\n2\n% cash and cash equivalents.\n95\nTable of Contents\n•\nThe U.K. pension trust had assets of $\n631\nmillion and $\n613\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and the target allocations in 2021 include\n55\n% fixed income,\n15\n% diversified growth funds,\n15\n% infrastructure,\n8\n% equities and\n7\n% real estate.\nThe pension assets are invested with the goal of producing a combination of capital growth, income and a liability hedge. The mix of assets is established after consideration of the long-term performance and risk characteristics of asset classes. Investments are selected based on their potential to enhance returns, preserve capital and reduce overall volatility. Holdings are diversified within each asset class. The portfolios employ a mix of index and actively managed equity strategies by market capitalization, style, geographic regions and economic sectors. The fixed income strategies include U.S. long duration securities, opportunistic fixed income securities and U.K. debt instruments. The short-term portfolio, whose primary goal is capital preservation for liquidity purposes, is composed of government and government-agency securities, uninvested cash, receivables and payables. The portfolios do not employ any financial leverage.\nU.S. Defined Contribution Plan\nAssets of the defined contribution plan in the U.S. consist primarily of investment options, which include actively managed equity, indexed equity, actively managed equity/bond funds, target date funds, S&P Global Inc. common stock, stable value and money market strategies. There is also a self-directed mutual fund investment option. The plan purchased\n107,651\nshares and sold\n160,415\nshares of S&P Global Inc. common stock in 2021 and purchased\n296,921\nshares and sold\n331,088\nshares of S&P Global Inc. common stock in 2020. The plan held approximately\n1.2\nmillion and\n1.3\nmillion shares of S&P Global Inc. common stock as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, with market values of $\n567\nmillion and $\n414\nmillion, respectively. The plan received dividends on S&P Global Inc. common stock of $\n3.8\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n8.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe issue stock-based incentive awards to our eligible employees under the 2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan and to our eligible non-employee Directors under a Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan. No further awards may be granted under the 2002 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2002 Plan”), although awards granted under the 2002 Plan prior to the adoption of the new 2019 Plan in June of 2019 remain outstanding in accordance with their terms.\n•\n2019 Employee Stock Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”)\n– The 2019 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, performance stock, restricted stock and other stock-based awards.\n•\nDirector Deferred Stock Ownership Plan\n– Under this plan, common stock reserved may be credited to deferred stock accounts for eligible Directors. In general, the plan requires that\n50\n% of eligible Directors’ annual compensation plus dividend equivalents be credited to deferred stock accounts. Each Director may also elect to defer all or a portion of the remaining compensation and have an equivalent number of shares credited to the deferred stock account. Recipients under this plan are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service. Shares will be delivered as of the date a recipient ceases to be a member of the Board of Directors or within\nfive years\nthereafter, if so elected. The plan will remain in effect until terminated by the Board of Directors or until no shares of stock remain available under the plan.\nThe number of common shares reserved for issuance are as follows:\n1\nShares available for granting at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are under the 2019 Plan.\n2\nShares reserved for issuance under the Director Deferred Stock Ownership Plan are not included in the total, but are less than\n1.0\nmillion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nWe issue treasury shares upon exercise of stock options and the issuance of restricted stock and unit awards. To offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options, we periodically repurchase shares. See Note 9 –\nEquity\nfor further discussion.\n96\nTable of Contents\nStock-based compensation expense and the corresponding tax benefit are as follows:\nStock Options\nStock options may not be granted at a price less than the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant. Stock options granted vest over a\nfour year\nservice period and have a maximum term of\n10\nyears. Stock option compensation costs are recognized from the date of grant, utilizing a\nfour-year\ngraded vesting method. Under this method, more than half of the costs are recognized over the first\ntwelve months\n, approximately one-quarter of the costs are recognized over a\ntwenty-four month\nperiod starting from the date of grant, approximately one-tenth of the costs are recognized over a\nthirty-six month\nperiod starting from the date of grant, and the remaining costs recognized over a\nforty-eight month\nperiod starting from the date of grant.\nThere were\nno\nstock options granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nStock option activity is as follows:\n1\nThere are less than\n0.1\nmillion shares forfeited and expired.\n1\nThere are less than\n0.1\nmillion shares vested.\n2\nThere are\nno\nnonvested options outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nThe total fair value of our stock options that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was less than $\n1\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively.\n97\nTable of Contents\nInformation regarding our stock option exercises is as follows:\nRestricted Stock and Unit Awards\nRestricted stock and unit awards (performance and non-performance) have been granted under the 2002 Plan and 2019 Plan. Performance unit awards will vest only if we achieve certain financial goals over the performance period. Restricted stock non-performance awards have various vesting periods (generally\nthree years\n), with vesting beginning on the first anniversary of the awards. Recipients of restricted stock and unit awards are not required to provide consideration to us other than rendering service.\nThe stock-based compensation expense for restricted stock and unit awards is determined based on the market price of our stock at the grant date of the award applied to the total number of awards that are anticipated to fully vest. For performance unit awards, adjustments are made to expense dependent upon financial goals achieved.\nRestricted stock and unit activity for performance and non-performance awards is as follows:\n9.\nEquity\nCapital Stock\nTwo\nmillion shares of preferred stock, par value $\n1\nper share, are authorized;\nnone\nhave been issued.\nOn January 26, 2022, the Board of Directors approved a quarterly common stock dividend of $\n0.77\nper share. Following the expected closing of the merger with IHS Markit, the Board of Directors will revisit the dividend policy of the combined Company.\nStock Repurchases\n98\nTable of Contents\nOn January 29, 2020, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of\n30\nmillion shares (the \"2020 Repurchase Program\"), which was approximately\n12\n% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time. On December 4, 2013, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program authorizing the purchase of\n50\nmillion shares (the \"2013 Repurchase Program\"), which was approximately\n18\n% of the total shares of our outstanding common stock at that time.\nOur purchased shares may be used for general corporate purposes, including the issuance of shares for stock compensation plans and to offset the dilutive effect of the exercise of employee stock options. As of December 31, 2021,\n30\nmillion shares remained available under the 2020 Repurchase Program and\n0.8\nmillion shares remained available under the 2013 repurchase program. Our 2020 Repurchase Program and 2013 Repurchase Program have no expiration date and purchases under these programs may be made from time to time on the open market and in private transactions, depending on market conditions.\nWe have entered into accelerated share repurchase (“ASR”) agreements with financial institutions to initiate share repurchases of our common stock. Under an ASR agreement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institution and receive an initial delivery of shares. This initial delivery of shares represents the minimum number of shares that we may receive under the agreement. Upon settlement of the ASR agreement, the financial institution delivers additional shares. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore the average price paid per share, is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR agreement based on the volume weighted-average share price, less a discount. We account for our ASR agreements as\ntwo\ntransactions: a stock purchase transaction and a forward stock purchase contract. The shares delivered under the ASR agreements resulted in a reduction of outstanding shares used to determine our weighted average common shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per share. The repurchased shares are held in Treasury. The forward stock purchase contracts were classified as equity instruments. The ASR agreements were executed under our 2013 Repurchase Program, approved on December 4, 2013.\nThe terms of each ASR agreement entered into for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, structured as outlined above, are as follows:\n1\nThe ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n500\nmillion and received an initial delivery of\n1.3\nmillion shares and an additional amount of\n0.2\nmillion in February 2020, representing a minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share. We completed the ASR agreement on July 27, 2020 and received an additional\n0.2\nmillion shares.\n2\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n500\nmillion and received an initial delivery of\n1.4\nmillion shares, representing\n85\n% of the $\n500\nat a price equal to the then market price of the Company. We completed the ASR agreement on July 27, 2020 and received an additional\n0.3\nmillion shares.\n3\nThe ASR agreement was structured as a capped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n500\nmillion and received an initial delivery of\n1.7\nmillion shares, and an additional amount of\n0.2\nmillion in August 2019, representing a minimum number of shares of our common stock to be repurchased based on a calculation using a specified capped price per share. We completed the ASR agreement on October 1, 2019 and received an additional\n0.1\nmillion shares.\n4\nThe ASR agreement was structured as an uncapped ASR agreement in which we paid $\n500\nmillion and received an initial delivery of\n2.2\nmillion shares, representing\n85\n% of the $\n500\nat a price equal to the then market price of the Company. We completed the ASR agreement on July 31, 2019 and received an additional\n0.1\nmillion shares.\nAdditionally, we purchased shares of our common stock in the open market as follows:\n99\nTable of Contents\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we did not use cash to purchase any shares. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we purchased a total of\n4.0\nmillion shares for $\n1,161\nmillion of cash. During the fourth quarter of 2019, we repurchased shares for $\n3\nmillion, which settled in the first quarter of 2020, resulting in $\n1,164\nmillion of cash used to repurchase shares. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we received\n5.9\nmillion shares, including\n0.4\nmillion shares received in January of 2019 related to our October 29, 2018 ASR agreement, resulting in $\n1,240\nmillion of cash used to repurchase shares.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nThe agreement with the minority partners that own\n27\n% of our S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture contains redemption features whereby interests held by minority partners are redeemable either (i) at the option of the holder or (ii) upon the occurrence of an event that is not solely within our control. Specifically, under the terms of the operating agreement of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC, CME Group and CME Group Index Services LLC (\"CGIS\") has the right at any time to sell, and we are obligated to buy, at least\n20\n% of their share in S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC. In addition, in the event there is a change of control of the Company, for the\n15\ndays following a change in control, CME Group and CGIS will have the right to put their interest to us at the then fair value of CME Group's and CGIS' minority interest.\nIf interests were to be redeemed under this agreement, we would generally be required to purchase the interest at fair value on the date of redemption. This interest is presented on the consolidated balance sheets outside of equity under the caption “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” with an initial value based on fair value for the portion attributable to the net assets we acquired, and based on our historical cost for the portion attributable to our S&P Index business. We adjust the redeemable noncontrolling interest each reporting period to its estimated redemption value, but never less than its initial fair value, using both income and market valuation approaches. Our income and market valuation approaches may incorporate Level 3 fair value measures for instances when observable inputs are not available. The more significant judgmental assumptions used to estimate the value of the S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC joint venture include an estimated discount rate, a range of assumptions that form the basis of the expected future net cash flows (e.g., the revenue growth rates and operating margins), and a company specific beta. The significant judgmental assumptions used that incorporate market data, including the relative weighting of market observable information and the comparability of that information in our valuation models, are forward-looking and could be affected by future economic and market conditions. Any adjustments to the redemption value will impact retained income.\nNoncontrolling interests that do not contain such redemption features are presented in equity.\nCh\nanges to redeemable noncontrolling interest during the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n100\nTable of Contents\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n1\nIncludes an unrealized gain related to our cross currency swaps. See note 6 – Derivative Instruments for additional detail of items recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n2\nReflects amortization of net actuarial losses and is net of a tax benefit of $\n3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021. See Note 7\n—\nEmployee Benefits\nfor additional details of items reclassed from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.\n3\nSee Note 6 –\nDerivative Instruments\nfor additional details of items reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss to net earnings.\n10.\nEarnings per Share\nBasic earnings per common share (\"EPS\") is computed by dividing net income attributable to the common shareholders of the Company by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted EPS is computed in the same manner as basic EPS, except the number of shares is increased to include additional common shares that would have been outstanding if potential common shares with a dilutive effect had been issued. Potential common shares consist primarily of stock options and restricted performance shares calculated using the treasury stock method.\nThe calculation for basic and diluted EPS is as follows:\nWe have certain stock options and restricted performance shares that are potentially excluded from the computation of diluted EPS. The effect of the potential exercise of stock options is excluded when the average market price of our common stock is lower than the exercise price of the related option during the period or when a net loss exists because the effect would have been antidilutive. Additionally, restricted performance shares are excluded because the necessary vesting conditions had not been met or when a net loss exists. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, there were\nno\nstock options excluded. Restricted\n101\nTable of Contents\nperformance shares outstanding of\n0.5\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and\n0.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were excluded.\n11.\nRestructuring\nWe continuously evaluate our cost structure to identify cost savings associated with streamlining our management structure. Our 2021 and 2020 restructuring plans consisted of company-wide workforce reductions of approximately\n30\nand\n830\npositions, respectively, and are further detailed below. The charges for each restructuring plan are classified as selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income and the reserves are included in other current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn certain circumstances, reserves are no longer needed because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance or were reassigned due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were initiated. In these cases, we reverse reserves through the consolidated statements of income during the period when it is determined they are no longer needed. There were approximately $\n8\nmillion of reserves from the 2020 restructuring plan that we have reversed in 2021, which offset the initial charge of $\n65\nmillion recorded for the 2020 restructuring plan. There were approximately $\n7\nmillion of reserves from the 2019 restructuring plan that we reversed in 2020, which offset the initial charge of $\n25\nmillion recorded for the 2019 restructuring plan.\nThe initial restructuring charge recorded and the ending reserve balance as of December 31, 2021 by segment is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we have made\nno\nreductions to the reserve for the 2021 restructuring plan. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have reduced the reserve for the 2020 restructuring plan by $\n45\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively. The reductions primarily related to cash payments for employee severance charges.\n12.\nSegment and Geographic Information\nAs discussed in Note 1 –\nAccounting Policies\n, we have\nfour\nreportable segments: Ratings, Market Intelligence, Platts and Indices.\nOur Chief Executive Officer is our chief operating decision-maker and evaluates performance of our segments and allocates resources based primarily on operating profit. Segment operating profit does not include Corporate Unallocated expense, other (income) expense, net, interest expense, net, or loss on extinguishment of debt as these are amounts that do not affect the operating results of our reportable segments. We use the same accounting policies for our segments as those described in Note 1 –\nAccounting Policies\n.\n102\nTable of Contents\nA summary of operating results for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n1\nRevenue for Ratings and expenses for Market Intelligence include an intersegment royalty charged to Market Intelligence for the rights to use and distribute content and data developed by Ratings.\n2\nOperating profit for the year ended December 31, 2021 includes a gain on disposition of $\n6\nmillion, recovery of lease-related costs of $\n4\nmillion and employee severance charges of $\n3\nmillion.

Transfers between geographic areas are recorded at agreed upon prices and intercompany revenue and profit are eliminated. No single customer accounted for more than\n10\n% of our consolidated revenue.\nThe following provides revenue and long-lived assets by geographic region:\nSee Note 2 –\nAcquisitions and\nDivestitures\nand Note 11 –\nRestructuring\n, for actions that impacted the segment operating results.\n13.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLeases\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a pre-tax impairment charge of $\n31\nmillion and $\n120\nmillion, respectively, related to the impairment and abandonment of operating lease related ROU assets. The pre-tax impairment charge recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 is associated with consolidating our real estate facilities following the expected merger with IHS Markit. The impairment charges are included in selling and general expenses within the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table provides information on the location and amounts of our leases on our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\n106\nTable of Contents\nSupplemental information related to leases for the years ended December 31 are as follows:\nWeighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for our operating leases as of December 31 are as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities for our operating leases are as follows:\nRelated Party Agreement\nIn June of 2012, we entered into a license agreement (the \"License Agreement\") with the holder of S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC noncontrolling interest, CME Group, which replaced the 2005 license agreement between Indices and CME Group. Under the terms of the License Agreement, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC receives a share of the profits from the trading and clearing of CME Group's equity index products. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC earned $\n139\nmillion, $\n149\nmillion and $\n114\nmillion of revenue under the terms of the License Agreement, respectively. The entire amount of this revenue is included in our consolidated statement of income and the portion related to the\n27\n% noncontrolling interest is removed in net income attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nLegal & Regulatory Matters\nIn the normal course of business both in the United States and abroad, the Company and its subsidiaries are defendants in a number of legal proceedings and are often subjected to government and regulatory proceedings, investigations and inquiries.\nS&P Global Ratings has been cooperating with an SEC investigation into possible violations of Section 15E of the Exchange Act and Rule 17g-5(c)(8) thereunder in connection with a 2017 credit rating analysis by S&P Global Ratings. S&P Global Ratings is currently in active discussions to resolve the SEC’s inquiry. S&P Global Ratings has not yet reached a definitive settlement agreement with the SEC on this matter but in the fourth quarter of 2021, accrued for potential monetary penalties based on discussions to date.  While we cannot predict with certainty whether we will reach agreement, or the terms of any such agreement, at this time, we do not believe that the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOn May 17, 2021, Indices reached a settlement with the SEC relating to the operation of a then undisclosed quality assurance mechanism and its impact on certain real-time values of the S&P 500 VIX Short-Term Futures Index ER on a single business day, February 5, 2018 (the “VIX Matter”), which was the subject of a previously disclosed Wells Notice.  Indices neither\n107\nTable of Contents\nadmitted nor denied the SEC's allegations. The SEC found that Indices acted negligently in violation of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933 with respect to the VIX Matter. The SEC acknowledged Indices’ cooperation with the SEC staff. The Company agreed to pay a penalty of $\n9\nmillion that was previously reserved for in 2020 and to cease and desist from committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Section 17(a)(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.\nA class action lawsuit was filed in Australia on August 7, 2020 against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company.  A separate lawsuit was filed against the Company and a subsidiary of the Company in Australia on February 2, 2021 by two entities within the Basis Capital investment group. The lawsuits both relate to alleged investment losses in collateralized debt obligations rated by Ratings prior to the financial crisis.  We can provide no assurance that we will not be obligated to pay significant amounts in order to resolve these matters on terms deemed acceptable.\nFrom time to time, the Company receives customer complaints, particularly, though not exclusively, in its Ratings and Indices segments.  The Company believes it has strong contractual protections in the terms and conditions included in its arrangements with customers.  Nonetheless, in the interest of managing customer relationships, the Company from time to time engages in dialogue with such customers in an effort to resolve such complaints, and if such complaints cannot be resolved through dialogue, may face litigation regarding such complaints.  The Company does not expect to incur material losses as a result of these matters.\nMoreover, various government and self-regulatory agencies frequently make inquiries and conduct investigations into our compliance with applicable laws and regulations, including those related to ratings activities and antitrust matters. For example, as a nationally recognized statistical rating organization registered with the SEC under Section 15E of the Exchange Act, S&P Global Ratings is in ongoing communication with the staff of the SEC regarding compliance with its extensive obligations under the federal securities laws. Although S&P Global seeks to promptly address any compliance issues that it detects or that the staff of the SEC or another regulator raises, there can be no assurance that the SEC or another regulator will not seek remedies against S&P Global for one or more compliance deficiencies. Any of these proceedings, investigations or inquiries could ultimately result in adverse judgments, damages, fines, penalties or activity restrictions, which could adversely impact our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position.\nIn view of the uncertainty inherent in litigation and government and regulatory enforcement matters, we cannot predict the eventual outcome of such matters or the timing of their resolution, or in most cases reasonably estimate what the eventual judgments, damages, fines, penalties or impact of activity (if any) restrictions may be. As a result, we cannot provide assurance that such outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position. As litigation or the process to resolve pending matters progresses, as the case may be, we will continue to review the latest information available and assess our ability to predict the outcome of such matters and the effects, if any, on our consolidated financial condition, cash flows, business or competitive position, which may require that we record liabilities in the consolidated financial statements in future periods.\n108\nTable of Contents"

There are no material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting that have been identified by management.\n4.\nOur independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has audited our consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2021, and has issued their reports on the financial statements and the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting. These reports are located on pages 64, 65 and 66 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the most recent quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."
