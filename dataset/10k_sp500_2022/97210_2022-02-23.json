We may experience a temporary adverse impact if any of our sole source suppliers delay or cease to deliver products.\nIntellectual Property and Licenses\nThe development of our products, both hardware and software, is based in significant part on proprietary information, our brands and technology. We protect our rights in proprietary information, brands and technology through various methods, such as:\nHowever, these protections might not be effective in all circumstances. Competitors might independently develop similar technology or exploit our proprietary information and our brands in countries where we lack enforceable intellectual property rights or where enforcement of such rights through the legal system provides an insufficient deterrent. Also, intellectual property protections can lapse or be invalidated through appropriate legal processes. We do not believe that any single piece of intellectual property or proprietary rights is essential to our business.\nHuman Capital Resources\nWe believe that our future success depends upon our continued ability to attract, develop, and retain a high-performance workforce, comprised of people with shared values. As of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 5,900 employees, of whom approximately 2,000 were employed in the United States and approximately 3,900 were employed outside of the United States. Our largest\nnon-US\nemployee populations are in the Philippines (16%), China (11%), Denmark (11%), Costa Rica (6%), and Taiwan (6%). We also leverage contractors to provide flexibility for our business and manufacturing needs. As of December 31, 2021, we worked with approximately 400 contractors globally. Since the inception of our business, we have experienced no work stoppages or other labor disturbances.\nCorporate Culture\nOur core values are conducting business with honesty and integrity, collaborating with our colleagues as a company without doors, and partnering with our customers every step of the way, because customers count on us.\n8\nWe strive to foster a positive work environment that helps employees thrive. It is a priority for us to ensure that our people feel inspired, supported, safe and able to achieve their personal best. We are committed to equality through nondiscrimination, harassment prevention and pay equity policies. We value a diverse, inclusive and respectful work environment where all employees enjoy challenging assignments, development opportunities and a safe, positive culture.\nWe are committed to conducting business in a responsible manner, with strategic operational policies, procedures and values that support transparency, sustainability and legal compliance.

Employees and managers look back on the previous year, review career development plans and create goals for the next year.\nWe are committed to recruiting and developing talent at the collegiate level to help advance STEM education for the future generation. For example, our paid internships and entry-level positions offer real-world experience, and our\nco-op\nprogram offers higher education students a unique learning opportunity as students alternate one semester in a work assignment and one semester in the classroom. Additionally, we pay $5,250 per year for educational courses related to an employee’s work or as part of a degree program, including tuition, lab fees and books. We also offer a scholarship program for employees with\ncollege-age\nchildren and grandchildren.\nEmployee Engagement\nWe conduct regular employee surveys to check in with our global workforce and obtain input on a number of topics. The feedback we receive from these surveys helps us assess employee sentiment, identify areas of improvement and guides our decision-making as it relates to people management. In addition, CEO Mark Jagiela and other executives meet with employees on a frequent basis through exchange meetings and quarterly webcasts. The exchange meetings allow the executives to directly interact with a small group of employees, while the global webcasts enable all employees to engage with senior leaders and ask questions in an open Q&A session.\nWe also offer employees an opportunity to network and connect with colleagues who share similar interests. This includes groups such as New Employees to Teradyne, Woman’s Affinity Group, Blue and Green (for team members that are committed to the environment), Runner’s affinity group and LGBTQ+ advocates.\n9\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe in fostering a diverse workforce and equitable and inclusive culture in order to build a stronger and more resilient company for our customers, our employees and our communities. To support this effort, we have a Diversity and Inclusion Charter which was developed by our Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DEI”) executive\nsub-committee\nand designed to ensure that we build diversity across our workforce. In addition, in 2021, we have hired our first DEI program manager. We have established programs for recruiting and hiring candidates from various backgrounds and experiences. We have implemented policies regarding gender pay equity and have conducted audits in the United States which have not identified any pay equity issues in the employee populations tested. We conduct mandatory\nDEI-related\ntraining program for our employees and offer a wide variety of optional\nDEI-related\ntraining courses as well. In 2021, managers participated in McKinsey Academy’s “Unlocking the Potential of Women” course. We are an equal opportunity and affirmative action employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, religion, ethnicity or national origin, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or any other characteristics protected by law.\nWe have a tradition of amplifying the charitable actions of our employees and responding to the needs of the communities where we work. To support positive change in society, we have donated to organizations fighting for social justice and racial equality. We also sponsor the Massachusetts Conference for Women and the California Conference for Women offering opportunities for business networking, professional development and personal growth.\nAdditionally, advancing education for future generations is a primary initiative at Teradyne. We support Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) programs at the middle, high school and collegiate level ranging from middle and high school robotics competitions to college scholarships, to underwriting university programs to increase the diversity of STEM graduates. We also donate test equipment and robots to colleges, universities, and vocational programs.\nHealth and Safety\nThe health and safety of our employees is our highest priority. We are committed to complying with all applicable regulatory health and safety requirements wherever we operate. We conduct internal audits, regular reviews and monitoring of regulations to ensure compliance with laws and regulations at the local, state, province and country levels. We ensure workers are provided with the knowledge to perform their jobs safely by deploying mandatory environmental, health and safety training. We also require contractors to complete safety training prior to working at any Teradyne site. We monitor, track and report common safety metrics such as accidents, near misses and illness. Our injury and illness rate is below the industry average. We also provide our employees with a flexible and adjustable workspace, which includes reviewing ergonomics issues in the workplace, educating employees to self-identify risks and ensuring they have the work environment they need to do their jobs safely and effectively.\nThroughout the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, we have focused on ensuring the health and safety of our employees. At the onset of the pandemic, we made the decision to close our offices and implement work from home policies for most employees. During this time, we have also provided resources to enable employees to effectively manage remote work, such as web conferencing and project collaboration solutions and furniture and equipment for\nat-home\noffices. To protect those employees where offices have opened or whose work requires them to be\non-site,\nwe’ve implemented cleaning processes, access to personal protection equipment and other protocols to ensure their safety. We have encouraged our workforce to become fully vaccinated. We have implemented a\nvaccine-or-test\npolicy for U.S. employees who work on site and recommend a similar policy for our\nnon-U.S.\nsites, subject to local regulations and the availability of vaccines and test kits. We have also supported our global workforce by sending regular\nall-employee\ncommunications, providing development opportunities for managers and employees to support effectively working virtually, establishing emergency response teams to empower local decision-making, conducting surveys to check in with employees, sharing regular video updates from our leadership team, and establishing a well-defined return to work process.\n10\nRegulatory Environment\nWe are subject to various federal, state, and local government laws and regulations relating to international trade, business conduct, the protection of employee health and safety and the environment.\nWe accrue for all known environmental liabilities when it becomes probable that we will incur cleanup costs and those costs can reasonably be estimated. Estimated environmental costs are not expected to materially affect the financial position or results of our operations in future periods. However, estimates of future costs are subject to change due to protracted cleanup periods and changing environmental remediation laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies, and in other circumstances we are required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. For example, we must comply with current U.S. Department of Commerce export control regulations restricting transactions with certain customers in China. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. Compliance with these laws has limited our sales and likely will continue to limit sales to certain customers in the future. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n11\nINFORMATION ABOUT OUR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS\nPursuant to General Instruction G (3) of Form\n10-K,\nthe following table is included in Part I of this Annual Report on Form\n10-K\nin lieu of being included in the Proxy Statement for the Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The table sets forth the names of all of our executive officers and certain other information relating to their positions held with Teradyne and other business experience. Our executive officers do not have a specific term of office but rather serve at the discretion of the Board of Directors.\n12"

Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and/or operating results.\nRisks Related to the\nCOVID-19\nPandemic\nThe novel coronavirus\n(COVID-19)\npandemic has impacted our business and could materially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nThe global pandemic of the novel strain of the coronavirus\n(COVID-19)\nhas resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings or social distancing requirements, quarantines,\nshelter-in-place\norders, vaccination and testing mandates, and business limitations and shutdowns. These measures have impacted our\nday-to-day\noperations and disrupted our business, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers. In the U.S., we have implemented a\nvaccine-or-test\npolicy which will require costs to implement testing protocols and increases the risk of employee attrition. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic, and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response, has adversely impacted our results of operations, including increasing costs company-wide, but we cannot accurately estimate the full extent of the impact to our 2021and 2020 financial results or to our future financial results.\nThe\nCOVID-19\npandemic has significantly increased economic and demand uncertainty in our markets. The uncertainty resulted in a decrease in orders for our Industrial Automation products in 2020 and could continue to impact the business for an uncertain period of time. The spread of\nCOVID-19\nhas caused us to modify our business practices, including implementing vaccination, testing, masking and social distancing policies, suspending employee travel, requiring most employees to work remotely, canceling physical participation in meetings, events and conferences, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and we may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers.\nWe are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. However, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of\nCOVID-19,\nwhich will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy, including, but not limited to, any new surges of the virus or new strains or variants of the virus, the broad availability of effective vaccines, further government actions to contain the virus, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nRisks Associated with Teradyne’s Markets\nOur business is impacted by global and industry-specific economic cycles, which are difficult to predict, and actions we have taken or may take to offset these cycles may not be sufficient.\nCapital equipment providers in the electronics, semiconductor industries and industrial automation, such as Teradyne, have, in the past, been negatively impacted by both sudden slowdowns in the global economies and recurring cyclicality within those industries. These cycles have resulted in periods of over-supply; a trend we believe will continue to occur. Our business and results of operations depend, in significant part, upon capital expenditures of manufacturers of semiconductors electronics and other industrial products, which in turn depend upon the current and anticipated market demand for those products. Disruption or deterioration in economic conditions may reduce customer purchases of our products, thereby reducing our revenues and earnings. In addition, such adverse changes in economic conditions, and resulting slowdowns in the market for our products, may, among other things, result in increased price competition for our products, increased risk of excess and obsolete inventories, increased risk in the collectability of our accounts receivable from our customers, potential reserves for doubtful accounts and write-offs of accounts receivable, increased risk of restructuring charges, and higher operating costs as a percentage of revenues, which, in each case and together, adversely affect our\n13\noperating results. We are unable to predict the likely duration, frequency and severity of disruptions in financial markets, credit availability, and adverse economic conditions throughout the world, and we cannot ensure that the level of revenues or new orders for a fiscal quarter will be sustained in subsequent quarters. We have taken actions to address the effects of general economic variability and recurring industry cyclicality, including implementing cost control and reduction measures. We cannot predict whether these measures will be sufficient to offset global or market-specific disruptions that might affect our businesses and we may need to take additional or different measures in the future.\nWe are subject to intense competition.\nWe face significant competition throughout the world in each of our reportable segments. Some of our competitors have substantial financial and other resources to pursue engineering, manufacturing, marketing and distribution of their products. We also face competition from emerging Asian companies and internal development at several of our customers. Some of our competitors have introduced or announced new products with certain performance characteristics that may be considered equal or superior to those we currently offer. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products or new technologies that provide improved cost of ownership and performance characteristics. New product introductions by competitors could cause a decline in revenues or loss of market acceptance of our products.\nThe market for our products is concentrated, and our business depends, in part, on obtaining orders from a few significant customers.\nThe market for our products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. In each of the years, 2021, 2020 and 2019, our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 33%, 36% and 27% of consolidated revenues, respectively.\nWe estimate consolidated revenues driven by one OEM customer, combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s OSATs (which include Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd.), accounted for approximately 19%, 25% and 10% of our consolidated revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We estimate consolidated revenues driven by Huawei, combining direct sales to Huawei with sales to Huawei’s OSATs accounted for approximately 0%, 3% and 11% of our consolidated revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In any one reporting period, a single customer or several customers may contribute even a larger percentage of our consolidated revenues. In addition, our ability to increase sales will depend, in part, on our ability to obtain orders from current or new significant customers. The opportunities to obtain orders from these customers may be limited, which may impair our ability to grow revenues. We expect that sales of our products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future. The loss of a significant customer or any reduction in orders by these customers, including reductions due to market or competitive conditions, would likely have a material adverse effect on our business, financial conditions or results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop new technologies to adapt to our customers’ needs and if our customers fail to accept our new products, our revenues will be adversely affected.\nWe believe that our technological position depends primarily on the technical competence and creative ability of our engineers. In a rapidly evolving market, such as ours, the development or acquisition of new technologies, commercialization of those technologies into products and market acceptance and customer demand for those products are critical to our success. Successful product development or acquisition, introduction and acceptance depend upon a number of factors, including:\n14\nRisks Associated with Operating a Global Business\nWe are subject to risks of operating internationally.\nA significant portion of our total revenues is derived from customers outside the United States. Our international sales and operations are subject to significant risks and difficulties, including:\nIn addition, an increasing portion of our products and the products we purchase from our suppliers are sourced or manufactured in foreign locations, including China, Malaysia and Denmark, and a large portion of the devices our products test are fabricated and tested by foundries and subcontractors in Taiwan, China, Korea and other parts of Asia. As a result, we are subject to a number of economic and other risks, particularly during times of political, health or financial instability in these regions. Disruption of manufacturing or supply sources in these international locations could materially adversely impact our ability to fill customer orders and potentially result in lost business.\nRisks Related to Teradyne’s Finances\nWe may not fully realize the benefits of our acquisitions or strategic alliances.\nIn June 2015, we acquired Universal Robots, in 2018, we acquired Energid and MiR and, in 2019, we acquired Lemsys and AutoGuide. We may not be able to realize the benefits of acquiring or successfully growing\n15\nthese businesses. We may continue to acquire additional businesses, form strategic alliances, or create joint ventures with third parties that we believe will complement or augment our existing businesses. We may not be able to realize the expected synergies and cost savings from the integration with our existing operations of other businesses or technologies that we may acquire. In addition, the integration process for our acquisitions may be complex, costly and time consuming and include unanticipated issues, expenses, and liabilities. We may have difficulty in developing, manufacturing, and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a manner that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines and allows us to realize value from expected synergies. Following an acquisition, we may not achieve the revenue or net income levels that justify the acquisition. Acquisitions may also result in\none-time\ncharges (such as acquisition-related expenses, write-offs or restructuring charges) or in the future, impairment of goodwill or acquired intangible assets, or adjustments to contingent consideration liabilities that adversely affect our operating results. Additionally, we may fund acquisitions of new businesses, strategic alliances, or joint ventures by utilizing our cash, incurring debt, issuing shares of our common stock, or by other means.\nWe may incur higher tax rates than we expect and may have exposure to additional international tax liabilities and costs.\nWe are subject to paying income taxes in the United States and various other countries where we operate. Our effective tax rate is dependent on where our earnings are generated and the tax regulations and the interpretation and judgment of administrative tax or revenue authorities in the United States and other countries. We have pursued a global tax strategy that could be adversely affected by the mix of earnings and tax rates in the countries where we operate, changes to tax laws, tax regulations or an adverse tax ruling by administrative authorities. We are also subject to tax audits in the countries where we operate. Any material change in our tax liability resulting from changes in tax laws, tax regulations, administrative ruling or from an audit from an administrative tax or revenue authority could negatively affect our financial results.\nAs a multinational corporation, we are subject to income taxes as well as\nnon-income-based\ntaxes, in both the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. In certain foreign jurisdictions, we qualify for tax incentives and tax holidays based on our ability to meet, on a continuing basis, various tests relating to our employment levels, research and development expenditures and other qualification requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction. While we intend to operate in such a manner to maintain and maximize our tax incentives and tax holidays, no assurance can be given that we have so qualified or that we will so qualify for any particular year or jurisdiction. If we fail to qualify or fail to remain qualified for certain foreign tax incentives and tax holidays, we may be subject to further taxation or an increase in our effective tax rate which would adversely impact our financial results. In December 2015, we entered into an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board which extended, until December 31, 2020, our Singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on December 31, 2015. In November 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board which extended our Singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. The new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025.\nThe tax savings attributable to the Singapore tax holiday for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $33.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share, $29.9 million or $0.16 per diluted share and $15.1 million or $0.08 per diluted share, respectively. These tax savings may not be achievable in subsequent years due to changes in Singapore’s tax laws or the expiration of the tax holiday.\nIn addition, we may incur additional costs, including headcount expenses, in order to maintain or obtain a foreign tax incentive or tax holiday in a particular foreign jurisdiction.\nWe have significant guarantees, indemnification, and customer confidentiality obligations.\nFrom time to time, we make guarantees to customers regarding the delivery, price and performance of our products and guarantee certain indebtedness, performance obligations or lease commitments of our subsidiary\n16\nand affiliate companies. We also have agreed to provide indemnification to our officers, directors, employees and agents, to the extent permitted by law, arising from certain events or occurrences, while the officer, director, employee or agent, is or was serving at our request in such capacity. Additionally, we have confidentiality obligations to certain customers and if breached would require the payment of significant penalties. If we become liable under any of these obligations, it could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. For additional information see Note M: “Commitments and Contingencies—Guarantees and Indemnification Obligations” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nWe may discontinue or reduce our quarterly cash dividend or share repurchase program.\nIn January 2014, our Board of Directors initiated a quarterly cash dividend. Since 2014, the Board of Directors has increased our quarterly cash dividend from $0.06 per share to $0.11 per share. Holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive dividends when and if they are declared by our Board of Directors.\nIn January 2015, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program. From January 2015 to April 2020, we repurchased $2.1 billion of common stock. Due to the uncertainty regarding the duration, severity and business impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, we suspended the stock repurchase program as of April 1, 2020. In January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new $2.0 billion share repurchase program. In 2021, we repurchased $600.0 million of common stock. Under the share repurchase program, we may repurchase outstanding shares of our common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions. Unless terminated earlier by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program.\nFuture cash dividends and share repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors and will depend, among other things, upon our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition. While we have declared a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock and authorized a share repurchase program, we are not required to do either and may reduce or eliminate our cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. The reduction or elimination of our cash dividend or our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nWe have incurred indebtedness and may incur additional indebtedness.\nOn December 12, 2016, we completed a private offering of $460.0 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due December 15, 2023 and received net proceeds, after issuance costs, of approximately $450.8 million, $33.0 million of which was used to pay the net cost, after being partially offset by proceeds from the sale of the warrants, of the convertible note hedge transactions and $50.1 million of which was used to repurchase 2.0 million shares of our common stock. Holders of the Notes may require us to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of certain fundamental changes involving us or the holders may elect to convert into shares of our common stock. As of February 23, 2022, eighty three holders had converted $362.6 million worth of notes.\nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $400.0 million. On December 10, 2021, the credit agreement was amended to extend maturity date of the credit facility to December 10, 2026. The amended credit agreement provides that, subject to customary conditions, we may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders the available incremental amount under the credit facility, not to exceed the greater of $200.0 million or 15% of consolidated EBIDTA. We could borrow funds under this credit facility at any time for general corporate purposes and working capital. As of February 23, 2022, we have not borrowed any funds under this credit facility.\nThe issuance of the Notes and any additional indebtedness, among other things, could:\n17\nRestrictive covenants in the agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility may restrict our ability to pursue business strategies.\nThe agreement governing our senior secured revolving credit facility limits our ability, among other things, to incur additional secured indebtedness; sell, transfer, license or dispose of assets; consolidate or merge; enter into transactions with our affiliates; and incur liens. In addition, our senior secured revolving credit facility contains financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that may be in our long-term best interest, such as, subject to permitted exceptions, making capital expenditures in excess of certain thresholds, making investments, loans and other advances, and prepaying any additional indebtedness while our indebtedness under our senior secured revolving credit facility is outstanding. Our failure to comply with financial and other restrictive covenants could result in an event of default, which if not cured or waived, could result in the lenders requiring immediate payment of all outstanding borrowings or foreclosing on collateral pledged to them to secure the indebtedness.\nOur convertible note hedge and warrant transactions could impact the value of our stock.\nConcurrent with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Note Hedge Transactions”) with the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the “Option Counterparties”). The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of our common stock that underlie the Notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the Notes of $31.52. The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 4.4 million shares of our common stock. On November 4, 2021, we made an irrevocable election under the indenture to require the principal portion of the remaining Notes to be settled in cash.\nSeparately and concurrent with the pricing of the Notes, we entered into warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties (the “Warrant Transactions”) in which we sold\nnet-share-settled\n(or, at our election subject to certain conditions, cash-settled) warrants to the Option Counterparties. The Warrant Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately 14.6 million shares of our common stock. The strike price of the warrants is $39.55 per share. The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect to our common stock to the extent that the market price per share of our common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrant Transactions, exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.\nThe Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to our common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. However, the Warrant Transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of our common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants. The net cost of the Note Hedge Transactions, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $33.0 million.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the Option Counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock and/or purchase shares of our common stock or other securities, including the Notes, concurrent with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Option Counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to our common stock or by selling our common stock or other securities, including the Notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the Notes). These activities could adversely impact the value of our common stock and the Notes.\n18\nWe may not be able to pay our debt and other obligations.\nIf our cash flows are inadequate to meet our obligations, we could face substantial liquidity problems. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flows or otherwise obtain funds necessary to make required payments on the Notes or certain of our other obligations, we would be in default under the terms thereof, which would permit the holders of those obligations to accelerate their maturity and also could cause defaults under future indebtedness we may incur. Any such default could have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial position and operating results. In addition, we cannot be certain that we would be able to repay amounts due on the Notes if those obligations were to be accelerated following the occurrence of any other event of default as defined in the instruments creating those obligations, or if the holders of the Notes require us to repurchase the Notes upon the occurrence of a fundamental change involving us. Moreover, we cannot be certain that we will have sufficient funds or will be able to arrange for financing to pay the principal amount due on the Notes at maturity.\nRisks Related to Operations\nOur operating results are likely to fluctuate significantly.\nOur operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially adversely affect revenues or profitability. The following factors could impact future operations:\nAs a result of the foregoing and other factors, we have experienced and may continue to experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis which could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, operating results or stock price.\n19\nIf our suppliers do not meet product or delivery requirements, we could have reduced revenues and earnings.\nIf any of our suppliers were to cancel contracts or commitments or fail to meet the quality or delivery requirements needed to satisfy customer orders for our products, we could lose time-sensitive customer orders, have significantly decreased revenues and earnings and be subject to contractual penalties, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. In addition, we rely on contract manufacturers for certain of our products, and our ability to meet customer orders for those products depends upon the timeliness and quality of the work performed by these subcontractors, over whom we do not exercise any control.\nTo a certain extent, we are dependent upon the ability of our suppliers and contract manufacturers to help meet increased product or delivery requirements. It may be difficult for certain suppliers to meet delivery requirements in a period of rapid growth, therefore impacting our ability to meet our customers’ demands.\nOur suppliers are subject to trade regulations, including tariffs and export restrictions imposed by the United States Government and by the governments of other countries. These regulations could impact our suppliers’ ability to provide us with components for our products or could increase the price of those components.\nWe rely on the financial strength of our suppliers. There can be no assurance that the loss of suppliers either as a result of financial viability, bankruptcy or otherwise will not have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations may be adversely impacted if our outsourced contract manufacturers or service providers fail to perform.\nWe depend on Flex Ltd. (“Flex”) to manufacture and test our FLEX and J750 family of products from its facilities in China and, starting in 2022, also Malaysia; Plexus Corp. (“Plexus”) to manufacture and test our Magnum products from its facilities in Malaysia and, starting in 2022, also Thailand and ETS family of products from its facility in Malaysia; SAM Meerkat to manufacture and test our storage test family of products from its facilities in Malaysia and Thailand and on other contract manufacturers to manufacture other products. If for any reason these contract manufacturers cannot provide us with these products in a timely fashion, or at all, we may not be able to sell these products to our customers until we enter a similar arrangement with an alternative contract manufacturer. The Flex facility located in China may be impacted by the ongoing trade dispute between the United States and China, by regulations implemented by the United States or China, or disruption caused by health pandemics, such as the coronavirus.\nIf we experience a problem with our supply of products from Flex, Plexus, SAM Meerkat, or our other contract manufacturers, it may take us significant time to either manufacture the product or find an alternate contract manufacturer, which could result in substantial expense and disruption to our business.\nWe have also outsourced certain general and administrative functions to reputable service providers, many of which are in foreign countries, sometimes impacting communication with them because of language and time differences. Their presence in foreign countries also increases the risk they could be exposed to political risk. Additionally, there may be difficulties encountered in coordinating the outsourced operations with existing functions and operations. If we fail in successfully coordinating and managing the outsourced service providers, it may cause an adverse effect on our operations which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur business may suffer if we are unable to attract and retain key employees.\nCompetition for employees with skills we require is intense in the high technology industry. We expect intense competition for employees to continue in 2022. Our success will depend on our ability to attract and\n20\nretain key technical employees. The loss of one or more key or other employees, a decrease in our ability to attract additional qualified employees, or the delay in hiring key personnel could each have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nOur operations, and the operations of our customers and suppliers, are subject to risks of natural catastrophic events, severe weather, widespread health epidemics, acts of war, terrorist attacks and the threat of domestic and international terrorist attacks, any one of which could result in cancellation of orders, delays in deliveries or other business activities, or loss of customers and could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nOur business is international in nature, with our sales, service and administrative personnel and our customers and suppliers located in numerous countries throughout the world. Our operations, and those of our customers and suppliers, are subject to disruption for a variety of reasons, including work stoppages, acts of war, terrorism, health epidemics, fires, earthquakes, hurricanes, typhoons, volcanic eruptions, energy shortages, telecommunication failures, tsunamis, flooding or other natural disasters. Such disruption could materially increase our costs and expenses as well as cause delays in, among other things, shipments of products to our customers, our ability to perform services requested by our customers, or the installation and acceptance of our products at customer sites. Any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nGlobal climate change can result in natural disasters occurring more frequently, with greater intensity and with less predictability. For example, in December 2021, our operations in Cebu, Philippines experienced a devastating typhoon. Our employees in Cebu succeeded in restoring most of our operations within days despite the severity of the damage in the region. We have offered support services to many of our employees impacted by the typhoon and have incurred additional costs to maintain our operations following the disaster. The long-term effects of climate change on the global economy and the semiconductor industry in particular are unclear but could be severe.\nThe global supply shortage of electrical components may impact our ability to meet customer demand.\nThere is currently a global supply shortage of electrical components, including semiconductor chips. As a result, we have experienced increases in our lead times and costs for certain components for certain products and delays in the delivery of some orders placed by our customers. At this time, these supply chain challenges have not had a material impact on our business, results of operations or financial condition. However, if we are unable to secure manufacturing capacities from our current suppliers and contract manufacturers, our ability to deliver our products to our customers may be negatively impacted. Also, our suppliers and contract manufacturers may increase their prices, which would result in an increase in our manufacturing costs, which we may not be fully able to pass to our customers, which could have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial condition.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property (“IP”) and Cybersecurity\nThird parties may claim we are infringing their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs, licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products.\nWe have been sued for patent infringement and receive notifications from time to time that we may be in violation of patents held by others. An assertion of patent infringement against us, if successful, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to sell our products or it could force us to seek a license to the intellectual property rights of others or alter such products so that they no longer infringe the intellectual property rights of others. A license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all. Similarly, changing our\n21\nproducts or processes to avoid infringing the rights of others may be costly or impractical. Additionally, patent litigation could require a significant use of management resources and involve a lengthy and expensive defense, even if we eventually prevail. If we do not prevail, we might be forced to pay significant damages, obtain licenses, modify our products, or stop making our products; each of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating results or cash flows.\nIf we are unable to protect our IP, we may lose a valuable asset or may incur costly litigation to protect our rights.\nWe protect the technology that is incorporated in our products in several ways, including through patent, copyright, trademark and trade secret protection and by contractual agreement. However, even with these protections, our IP may still be challenged, invalidated or subject to other infringement actions. While we believe that our IP has value in the aggregate, no single element of our IP is in itself essential. If a significant portion of our IP is invalidated or ineffective, our business could be materially adversely affected.\nA breach of our operational or security systems could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe rely on various information technology networks and systems to process, transmit and store electronic information, including proprietary and confidential data, and to carry out and support a variety of business activities, including manufacturing, research and development, supply chain management, sales and accounting. We have experienced several attempted cyber-attacks of our network. None of the attempted attacks has caused a disruption to our operations or had a material adverse effect on our business or financial results. As a result of the attempts, we have taken further preventive security measures to protect our systems. Despite these preventative security measures we have implemented, we may continue to be vulnerable to attempts by third parties to gain unauthorized access to our networks or sabotage our systems. These attempts, which might be related to criminal hackers, industrial espionage or state-sponsored intrusions, include trying to covertly introduce malware to our computers, networks and systems and impersonating authorized users. In addition, third party suppliers and service providers that we rely on to manage our networks and systems and process and store our proprietary and confidential data may also be subject to similar attacks. Such attempts could result in the misappropriation, theft, misuse, disclosure or loss or destruction of the intellectual property, or the proprietary, confidential or personal information, of Teradyne or our employees, customers, suppliers or other third parties, as well as damage to or disruptions in our information technology networks and systems. These threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty of defending against them or implementing adequate preventative measures. While we seek to detect and investigate all security incidents and to prevent their recurrence, attempts to gain unauthorized access to our information technology networks and systems may be successful, and in some cases, we might be unaware of an incident or its magnitude and effects. A failure in or a breach of our operational or security systems or infrastructure, or those of our suppliers and other service providers, including as a result of cyber-attacks, could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses and increase our costs. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our information technology networks and systems.\nA breach of the security of our products could negatively affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be subject to security breaches of certain of our products caused by viruses, illegal\nbreak-ins\nor hacking, sabotage, or acts of vandalism by third parties or our employees or contractors. A breach of our product security systems could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial results, disrupt our business, result in the disclosure or misuse of proprietary or confidential information, damage our reputation, cause losses, and increase our costs. We expect to continue to devote significant resources to the security of our products.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Compliance\nThe implementation of tariffs on our products may have a material impact on our business.\nOur business operations and supply chain are global and may be disrupted by the implementation of tariffs.\n22\nIn 2018, the United States Trade Representative imposed a 25% tariff on many lists of products, including certain Teradyne products that are made in China and imported into the United States. We have implemented operational changes that mitigate the impact of the 25% tariff on the import of our impacted products into the United States. As a result, the existing tariff has not had a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. The implementation of additional tariffs by the United States could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn addition to the actions taken by the United States, China has implemented retaliatory tariffs on products made in the United States and imported into China, including certain Teradyne products. We have implemented, if appropriate, operational changes that would mitigate the impact of the retaliatory tariffs. However, notwithstanding our efforts, the retaliatory tariffs or other trade restrictions implemented by China could disrupt our business operations, sales and supply chain and, therefore, have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nTrade regulations and restrictions impact our ability to sell products to and support certain customers, which may materially adversely affect our sales and results of operations.\nWe are subject to U.S. laws and regulations that limit and restrict the export of some of our products and services and may restrict our transactions with certain customers, business partners and other persons. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations prohibit the export of certain products, services and technologies, and in other circumstances are required to obtain an export license before exporting the controlled item. We must also comply with export restrictions and laws imposed by other countries affecting trade and investments. We maintain an export compliance program but there are risks that the compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. Compliance with these laws has not significantly limited our sales but could significantly limit them in the future. Changes in, and responses to, U.S. trade policy could reduce the competitiveness of our products and cause our sales to drop, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn 2018, the United States Department of Commerce announced that it has commenced a review of new export controls focusing on emerging and foundational technologies. The new export controls could cover technologies used in one or more Teradyne products and therefore could impact the sales of certain Teradyne products.\nThe U.S. government from time to time has issued export restrictions that prohibit U.S. companies from exporting U.S. manufactured products, foreign manufactured products with more than 25% controlled U.S. content, as well as U.S. origin technology. For example, the U.S. Department of Commerce has restricted the access of U.S. origin technologies to certain Chinese companies by adding those companies to the Entity List under U.S. Export Administration Regulations (“EAR”).\nOn May 16, 2019, Huawei and 68 of its affiliates, including HiSilicon, were added to the U.S. Department of Commerce Entity List under the EAR. This action by the U.S. Department of Commerce imposes new export licensing requirements on exports,\nre-exports,\nand\nin-country\ntransfers of all U.S. regulated products, software and technology to the designated Huawei entities. On August 17, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce published final regulations expanding the scope of the U.S. EAR to include additional products that would become subject to export restrictions relating to Huawei entities including HiSilicon. These new regulations restrict the sale to Huawei and the designated Huawei entities of certain\nnon-U.S.\nmade items, such as semiconductor devices, manufactured for or sold to Huawei entities including HiSilicon under specific, detailed conditions set forth in the new regulations. These new regulations have impacted our sales to Huawei, HiSilicon and their suppliers. We are taking appropriate actions, including filing license applications and obtaining licenses from the U.S. Department of Commerce. However, we do not expect these actions will mitigate the impact of the regulations on our sales to Huawei, HiSilicon and other suppliers. As a result, the regulations will continue to\n23\nhave an adverse impact on our business and financial results. It is uncertain the extent these new regulations and any additional regulations that may be implemented by the U.S. Department of Commerce or other government agency may have on our business with other customers or potential customers. Also, our controls related to Entity List compliance could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities.\nOn April 28, 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce published new export control regulations for certain U.S. products and technology sold to military end users or for military\nend-use\nin China, Russia and Venezuela. The definition of military end user is broad. The regulations went into effect on June 29, 2020. In December 2020, the U.S. Department of Commerce issued a list of companies in China and other countries that it considered to be military end users. We expect that compliance with the new export controls will impact our ability to sell products to certain customers in China. In addition, the new export controls could disrupt our supply chain, increase our compliance costs and impact the demand for our products in China and, thus, have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. While we maintain an export compliance program, our compliance controls could be circumvented, exposing us to legal liabilities. We will continue to assess the impact of the new export controls on our business and operations and take appropriate actions, including filing for licenses with the U.S. Department of Commerce, to minimize any disruption. However, we cannot be certain that the actions we take will mitigate all the risks associated with the new export controls that may impact our business.\nIn response to the regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Commerce, the Chinese government has passed new laws, including blocking legislation, which may impact our business activities in China. The Company is assessing the potential impact of these new Chinese laws and monitoring relevant laws and regulations issued by the Chinese government. The impact of these new Chinese laws on our business activities in China remains uncertain at this time.\nWe may be subject to product recalls and warranty and product liability claims.\nWe invest significant resources in the design, manufacturing and testing of our products. However, from time to time, we discover design or manufacturing defects in our products after they have been shipped and, as a result, we have incurred development and remediation costs and settled warranty and product liability claims. In addition, when our products contain defects or have reliability, quality or safety issues, we have conducted a product recall which resulted in significant repair or replacement costs and substantial delays in product shipments and may damage our reputation which could make it more difficult to sell our products. We could continue to have warranty and product liability claims or product recalls in the future. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may incur significant costs of complying with present and future environmental regulations and may incur significant liabilities if we fail to comply with such environmental regulations.\nWe are subject to both domestic and international environmental regulations and statutory strict liability relating to the use, storage, discharge, site cleanup and disposal of hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes. In addition, future regulations in response to global climate change may affect us, our suppliers, and our customers. Such regulations could cause us to incur additional direct costs for compliance, as well as increased indirect costs resulting from our customers, suppliers, or both incurring additional compliance costs that are passed on to us. Future climate change regulations could result in decreased demand for our products. If we fail to comply with present and future regulations, or are required to perform site remediation, we could be subject to future liabilities or cost, including penalties or the suspension of production. Present and future regulations may also:\n24\nPursuant to present regulations and agreements, we are conducting groundwater and subsurface assessment and monitoring and are implementing remediation and corrective action plans for facilities located in Massachusetts and New Hampshire which are no longer conducting manufacturing operations. As of December 31, 2021, we have not incurred material costs as a result of the monitoring and remediation steps taken at the Massachusetts and New Hampshire sites.\nThe directive on the Restriction of the Use of Certain Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the “RoHS Directive”) and the directive on Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (the “WEEE Directive”) altered the form and manner in which electronic equipment is imported, sold and handled in the European Union. Other jurisdictions, such as China, have followed the European Union’s lead in enacting legislation with respect to hazardous substances and waste removal. Ensuring compliance with the RoHS Directive, the WEEE Directive and similar legislation in other jurisdictions, and integrating compliance activities with our suppliers and customers could result in additional costs and disruption to operations and logistics and thus, could have a negative impact on our business, operations or financial condition.\nWe currently are, and in the future may be, subject to litigation or regulatory proceedings that could have an adverse effect on our business.\nFrom time to time, we may be subject to litigation or other administrative, regulatory or governmental proceedings, including tax audits and resulting claims that could require significant management time and resources and cause us to incur expenses and, in the event of an adverse decision, pay damages or incur costs in an amount that could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations.\nWe may face risks associated with shareholder activism.\nWe may become subject to campaigns by shareholders advocating corporate actions such as financial restructuring, increased borrowing, special dividends, stock repurchases or divestitures. Such activities could interfere with our ability to execute our business plans, be costly and time-consuming, disrupt our operations, divert the attention of management, or result in our initiating borrowing or increasing our share repurchase plan or dividend, any of which could have an adverse effect on our business or stock price.\nProvisions of our charter and\nby-laws\nand Massachusetts law may make a takeover of Teradyne more difficult.\nThere are provisions in our basic corporate documents and under Massachusetts law that could discourage, delay or prevent a change in control, even if a change in control may be regarded as beneficial to some or all of our stockholders."

    "text": "Overview\nWe are a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. We design, develop, manufacture and sell automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Our industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots (“AMRs”) and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing, logistics and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing and logistics costs. Our automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:\n27\nThe market for our test products is concentrated with a limited number of significant customers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of test equipment. A few customers drive significant demand for our test products both through direct sales and sales to the customers’ supply partners. We expect that sales of our test products will continue to be concentrated with a limited number of significant customers for the foreseeable future.\nIn 2021, revenue in our test businesses exceeded our plan as a result of increased Semiconductor Test demand and broad-based growth in our Wireless Test and Storage Test businesses. In 2022, we expect lower demand in our Semiconductor Test business due to a slower technology transition in one of our largest\nend-markets.\nWe expect this demand to accelerate in 2023 as a result of the expected ramp in 3 nanometer volume production.\nOur Industrial Automation segment consists of Universal Robots A/S (“UR”), a leading supplier of collaborative robotic arms, Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (“MiR”), a leading maker of AMRs for industrial automation and AutoGuide, LLC (“AutoGuide”), a maker of high payload AMRs. The market for our Industrial Automation segment products is dependent on the adoption of new automation technologies by large manufacturers as well as small and medium enterprises (SMEs) throughout the world.\nIn 2021, our Industrial Automation segment returned to growth following the global industrial downturn as well as the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic in 2020. We expect our UR and MiR businesses to continue to grow in 2022, while our AutoGuide business will focus on continuing to invest to scale and integrate high payload AMR solutions.\nOur corporate strategy continues to focus on profitably gaining market share in our test businesses through the introduction of differentiated products that target expanding segments and accelerating growth through continued investment in our Industrial Automation businesses. We plan to execute on our strategy while balancing capital allocations between returning capital to our shareholders through stock repurchases and dividends and using capital for opportunistic acquisitions.\nImpact of the\nCOVID-19\nPandemic on our Business\nThe novel coronavirus\n(COVID-19)\npandemic resulted in government authorities implementing numerous measures in an effort to contain the spread of the virus, such as travel bans and restrictions, limitations on gatherings or social distancing requirements, quarantines,\nshelter-in-place\norders, vaccination and testing mandates, and business limitations and shutdowns. These measures have impacted our\nday-to-day\noperations and disrupted our business, workforce and operations, as well as the operations of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers. We are continuing to monitor the rapidly evolving situation regarding the\nCOVID-19\npandemic and the availability and impact of vaccinations globally. However, we are unable to accurately predict the full impact of\nCOVID-19,\nwhich will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with accuracy, including, but not limited to, any new surges or new strains or variants of the virus in areas where we do business, the availability and use of vaccinations, any further government actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume.\nHealth and Safety\nIn response to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, we have taken proactive, aggressive action to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers and we have complied with all government orders around the globe. The spread of\nCOVID-19\nhas caused us to modify our business practices,\n28\nincluding implementing social distancing protocols, suspending employee travel, requiring most employees to work remotely, cancelling physical participation in meetings, and extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces. Around the world, the majority of our employees are working from home. However, some of our engineering, operations, supply line and customer support teams must be\non-site\nat our or our customers’ facilities. We are providing those\non-site\nemployees with the necessary protective resources and procedures to minimize their exposure risk. We may take further actions as may be required or recommended by government authorities or that we determine are in the best interests of our employees, customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers.\nOperations\nWe believe the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, and the numerous measures implemented by authorities in response, has adversely impacted our results of operations, including by increasing costs and, in 2020, decreasing demand in our Industrial Automation businesses, but we cannot accurately estimate the amount of the impact to our 2021 and 2020 financial results or to our future financial results. In addition, the pandemic has disrupted our contract manufacturers and suppliers, and has resulted in some instances in short-term cost increases to meet customer demand. While the duration and severity of the pandemic may further impact our workforce and operations, as well as those of our customers, contract manufacturers and suppliers, we expect that our manufacturing facilities will remain operational, at sufficient capacity to support production demand. We are monitoring our operations closely in an effort to avoid any potential productivity loss caused by responses to the\nCOVID-19\npandemic.\nSupply\nWe have experienced interruptions to our supply chain as a result of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic. Our suppliers have faced and may continue to face difficulties maintaining operations in light of\nCOVID-19\ndisruptions and government-ordered restrictions. Our supply chain team, and our suppliers, continue to manage numerous supply, production, and logistics obstacles caused by the pandemic. There is no assurance that these efforts will be successful. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic may continue to disrupt our ability to obtain components required to manufacture our products, adversely affecting our operations and in some instances resulting in higher costs and delays, both for obtaining components and shipping finished goods to customers.\nDemand\nThe\nCOVID-19\npandemic has significantly increased economic uncertainty in our markets. Demand for our Test products was strong throughout 2020 and 2021. Our Industrial Automation business, however, experienced a significant decline in demand through the first half of 2020 due to\nCOVID-19\nrelated shutdowns affecting global manufacturing but demand recovered in the second half of 2020 from the low point in the second quarter and continued to recover in 2021. The\nCOVID-19\npandemic could cause further global economic disruption that could cause demand for our products to decline, which would adversely affect our business.\nLiquidity\nAlthough there is continued uncertainty related to the impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic on our future results, we believe our business model and our current cash reserves leave us well-positioned to manage our business through this crisis. We have a strong balance sheet as well as an operating model that we believe is capable of flexing up and down with extreme demand swings while still remaining profitable. Based on our analysis, we believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents and our currently anticipated operating cash flows will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and other capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months. However, due to the uncertainty related to the future impact of the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, in order to bolster our liquidity position, on May 1, 2020 we entered into a credit agreement providing for a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $400 million. On December 10, 2021, we amended the credit agreement to extend its maturity to December 10, 2026 as further described in Note J: “Debt.” As of February 23, 2022, we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.\n29\nWe are continuing to monitor the evolving situation regarding the\nCOVID-19\npandemic, the availability of vaccinations where we do business and guidance from government authorities around the world. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to adjust our operating plan. As a result, given the uncertain nature of this situation, we are not able to accurately predict the full extent of the impact of\nCOVID-19\non our business, financial condition, results of operations, liquidity, or cash flows in the future. In addition, see Part II—Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” included herein for updates to our risk factors regarding risks associated with the\nCOVID-19\npandemic.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe have identified the policies and estimates discussed below as critical to understanding our business and our results of operations and financial condition. The impact and any associated risks related to these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results. For a full description of our accounting policies related to the below items refer to Note B. Accounting Policies, included in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report.\nDue to\nthe COVID-19\npandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets. We are not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to our estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on\nForm 10-K.\nCritical accounting estimates are complex and may require significant judgment by management. Changes to the underlying assumptions may have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations. These estimates may change, as new events occur, and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nIn accordance with ASC 606, “\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers” (“ASC 606”)\n, we recognize revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. Our determination of revenue requires judgment in the determination of performance obligations and allocation of the transaction price to performance obligations. We often sell bundled orders that include both product and services or multiple different products within the same order. We evaluate each of the deliverables to determine if it meets the definition of a performance obligation, which requires that it is capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the contract. This determination is based on an assessment of contractual rights of the contract and the ability of the performance obligation to perform on its own or with readily available resources. In bundled transactions we estimate the standalone selling price of each identified performance obligation and use that estimate to allocate the transaction price among said performance obligations. The estimated standalone selling price is determined using all information reasonably available to us, including standalone transactions, market information and other observable inputs.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost using a standard costing system which approximates cost based on a\nfirst-in,\nfirst-out\nbasis or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, we evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window, is written down to estimated net realizable value. Forecasted demand information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated revenues. The demand forecast is based on assumptions around the product life and customer and market forecasts.\n30\nRetirement and Postretirement Plans\nWe recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.\nIn developing the expected return on U.S. Plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. We believe that 2.4% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2021. The December 31, 2021 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan was 94% invested in fixed income securities, 5% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.\nThe discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on the FTSE Pension Index adjusted for the U.S. Plan’s expected cash flows and was 2.65% at December 31, 2021, up from 2.3% at December 31, 2020. We estimate that in 2022 we will recognize approximately $1.8 million of pension expense for the U.S. Plan. The U.S. Plan pension expense estimate for 2022 is based on a 2.65% discount rate and a 2.0% return on assets. Future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.\nGoodwill, Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of December 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently, when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired. We review intangible and long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Goodwill impairment will be the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. Impairment of intangible and long-lived assets would result in the asset being written down to its estimated fair value. The calculated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible or long-lived asset is dependent upon discounted cash flow (“DCF”) models, discount rates, and market multiples. DCF models rely on our forecasted\nmid-term\nplans which are subjective based on customer or market conditions and can change materially. We utilize third party specialists when determining discount rates and selected market multiples. A change in any of these key assumptions could result in a reporting unit, intangible asset, or long-lived asset being impaired in a future period.\nConvertible Debt\nOur convertible debt is subject to conversion, under certain circumstances, upon notification from our Note Holders. At the time of conversion, we recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the calculated fair value of the debt immediately prior to its conversion and the carrying amount of the debt component, including any unamortized debt discount or issuance costs. The key estimate in determining the calculated fair value is the borrowing rate which requires judgment using market data for\nnon-convertible\ndebt instruments with similar tenor to the remaining life of our debt.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the\n31\ndifferences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Evaluating the positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740, “\nAccounting for Income Taxes\n” is a key judgment in the valuation of income taxes. This assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and\ntax-planning\nstrategies. Although realization is not assured, based on our assessment, we concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized.\nResults of Operations\nInformation pertaining to fiscal year 2019 results of operations, including a\nyear-to-year\ncomparison against fiscal year 2020, was included in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020 under Part II, Item 7, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Position and Results of Operations,” which was filed with the SEC on February 22, 2021. This information is incorporated by reference herein.\nThe following table sets forth the percentage of total net revenues included in our consolidated statements of operations:\n32\nRevenues\nRevenues for our reportable segments were as follows:\nThe increase in Semiconductor Test revenues of $382.7 million, or 16.9%, was primarily due to greater tester sales driven by testing high performance compute processors and industrial and automotive devices, partially offset by lower tester sales for mobile application processors. The rise in System Test revenues of $58.0 million, or 14.2%, was driven primarily by elevated sales in Storage Test for system level test demand, and greater sales in Production Board Test. The increase in Industrial Automation revenues of $96.2 million, or 34.4%, was driven by demand for collaborative robotic arms and collaborative autonomous mobile robots. The rise in Wireless Test revenues of $43.9 million, or 25.4%, was primarily due to an increase in WiFi tester sales and higher demand in ultra-wide band wireless test.\nOur reportable segments accounted for the following percentages of consolidated revenues:\nRevenues by country as a percentage of total revenues were as follows (1):\n33\nThe breakout of product and service revenues was as follows:\nOur product revenues increased $505.7 million, or 18.8%, primarily due to greater tester sales in Semiconductor Test driven by testing high performance compute processors and industrial and automotive devices, partially offset by lower tester sales for mobile application processors, the rise in System Test revenues primarily due to elevated sales in Storage Test for system level test demand, and greater sales in Production Board Test, increase in Industrial Automation revenues driven by demand for collaborative robotic arms and collaborative autonomous mobile robots, the rise in Wireless Test revenues due to an increase in WiFi tester sales and higher demand in ultra-wide band wireless test.\nIn 2021 and 2020, revenues from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., a customer of our Semiconductor Test segment, accounted for 12% and 15%, respectively, of our consolidated revenues. In 2021 and 2020, our five largest direct customers in aggregate accounted for 33% and 36% of our consolidated revenues, respectively.\nWe estimate consolidated revenues driven by one OEM customer, combining direct sales to that customer with sales to the customer’s OSATs, accounted for approximately 19% and 25% of our consolidated revenues in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percent of total revenues increased by 2.4 points, primarily due to product mix of higher margin products in Semiconductor Test, increase in service margins and operating leverage due to higher revenues.\nThe breakout of product and service gross profit was as follows:\n34\nWe assess the carrying value of our inventory on a quarterly basis by estimating future demand and comparing that demand against\non-hand\nand\non-order\ninventory positions. Forecasted revenues information is obtained from the sales and marketing groups and incorporates factors such as backlog and future consolidated revenues. This quarterly process identifies obsolete and excess inventory. Obsolete inventory, which represents items for which there is no demand, is fully reserved. Excess inventory, which represents inventory items that are not expected to be consumed within the forecasted demand window, is written down to estimated net realizable value.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded an inventory provision of $15.5 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products. Of the $15.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $6.7 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $6.4 million was related to Industrial Automation, $1.8 million was related to Wireless Test, and $0.6 million was related to System Test.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded an inventory provision of $17.5 million included in cost of revenues, primarily due to downward revisions to previously forecasted demand levels for certain products. Of the $17.5 million of total excess and obsolete provisions, $11.0 million was related to Semiconductor Test, $4.8 million was related to Wireless Test, $0.9 million was related to System Test, and $0.8 million was related to Industrial Automation.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we scrapped $10.9 million and $7.7 million of inventory, respectively, and sold $2.5 million and $2.3 million of previously written-down or\nwritten-off\ninventory, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had inventory related reserves for amounts which had been written-down or\nwritten-off\ntotaling $114.1 million. We have no\npre-determined\ntimeline to scrap the remaining inventory.\nSelling and Administrative\nSelling and administrative expenses were as follows:\nThe increase of $82.8 million in selling and administrative expenses was primarily due to higher variable compensation and greater selling and administrative spending across all segments.\nEngineering and Development\nEngineering and development expenses were as follows:\nThe increase of $52.6 million in engineering and development expenses was primarily due to higher spending in Semiconductor Test, System Test and Industrial Automation segments and higher variable compensation.\n35\nRestructuring and Other\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $1.5 million of severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, $0.5 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses and $14.5 million for other expenses, offset by a $7.2 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the AutoGuide contingent consideration liability.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded a $19.7 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the AutoGuide contingent consideration liability, and a $3.5 million gain for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by a $4.0 million contract termination settlement charge, $2.5 million of acquisition related compensation and expenses, $2.3 million of severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, and $1.2 million of other expenses.\nInterest and Other\nInterest income decreased by $3.4 million primarily due to lower interest rates and a lower marketable securities balance in 2021 compared to 2020. Interest expense decreased by $6.4 million primarily due to lower convertible debt interest expense due to early conversions in 2021. Other (income) expense, net increased by $15.4 million primarily due to $28.8 million of losses on convertible debt conversions in 2021, partially offset by the change in pension actuarial gains/losses, from a $10.3 million loss in 2020 to a $2.2 million gain in 2021.\nIncome (Loss) Before Income Taxes\nThe increase in income before income taxes in Semiconductor Test was primarily due to greater tester sales driven by testing high performance compute processors and industrial and automotive devices, partially offset by lower tester sales for mobile application processors. The decrease in loss before income taxes in Industrial Automation was primarily due to demand for collaborative robotic arms and collaborative autonomous mobile robots and lower intangible assets amortization expense. The increase in income before income taxes in System Test was driven primarily by elevated sales in Storage Test for system level test demand, and greater sales in\n36\nProduction Board Test. The increase in income before income taxes in Wireless Test was primarily due to an increase in WiFi tester sales and higher demand in ultra-wide band wireless test. The loss before income taxes in Corporate and Other was primarily due to losses on convertible debt conversions in 2021.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense for 2021and 2020, totaled $146.4 million and $116.9 million, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020 was 12.6% and 13.0%, respectively.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the expense from U.S. global\nlow-taxed\nincome partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from foreign tax credits and a shift in the geographic distribution of income, which increased the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions.\nWe qualify for a tax holiday in Singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. The tax savings attributable to the Singapore tax holiday for the years ended December 31, 2021and 2020 were $33.3 million or $0.18 per diluted share and $29.9 million or $0.16 per diluted share, respectively. In November 2020, we entered into an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board which extended our Singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. The new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on December 31, 2025.\nCapital Resources and Material Cash Requirements\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance decreased by $54 million in 2021 to $1,500 million. Cash decreased due to stock repurchases in the amount of $600 million, payments of convertible debt principal in the amount of $343 million, quarterly cash dividend payments in the amount of $66 million offset by cash generated by our global operations.\nOperating activities during 2021 provided cash of $1,098.4 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $98.8 million. This was due to a $227.1 million increase in operating assets and a $128.4 million increase in operating liabilities.\nThe increase in operating assets was due to a $175.8 million increase in prepayments and other assets due to prepayments to our contract manufacturers, a $57.8 million increase in accounts receivable due to greater sales, partially offset by a $6.5 million decrease in inventories.\nThe increase in operating liabilities was due to a $63.5 million increase in other accrued liabilities, a $35.1 million increase in accrued employee compensation, a $22.9 million increase in accounts payable, and a $9.9 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advance payments, partially offset by a $5.6 million decrease in income taxes, and $5.4 million of retirement plan contributions.\nInvesting activities during 2021 provided cash of $120.4 million, due to $660.1 million and $266.5 million in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, respectively, partially offset by $661.8 million used for purchases of marketable securities, $132.5 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, and $12.0 million used for an investment in MachineMetrics, Inc. (“MachineMetrics”).\nFinancing activities during 2021 used cash of $1,008.6 million, due to $600.0 million used for the repurchase of 4.8 million shares of common stock at an average price of $125.74 per share, $343.0 million used for the payments of convertible debt principal, $66.0 million used for dividend payments, and $32.3 million used for payments related to net settlement of employee stock compensation awards, partially offset by $32.7 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\n37\nOperating activities during 2020 provided cash of $868.9 million. Changes in operating assets and liabilities used cash of $69.4 million. This was due to a $202.3 million increase in operating assets and a $132.9 million increase in operating liabilities.\nThe increase in operating assets was due to a $129.5 million increase in accounts receivable due to increased sales, an $8.4 million increase in inventories, and a $64.4 million increase in prepayments and other assets.\nThe increase in operating liabilities was due to a $54.7 million increase in accrued employee compensation, a $40.0 million increase in deferred revenue and customer advance payments, a $25.2 million increase in income taxes, a $12.8 million increase in other accrued liabilities, and a $5.7 million increase in accounts payable, partially offset by $5.4 million of retirement plan contributions.\nInvesting activities during 2020 used cash of $569.8 million, due to $900.2 million used for purchases of marketable securities, and $185.0 million used for purchases of property, plant and equipment, partially offset by $480.0 million and $35.0 million in proceeds from maturities and sales of marketable securities, respectively, and proceeds from life insurance of $0.5 million related to the cash surrender value from the cancellation of Teradyne owned life insurance policy.\nFinancing activities during 2020 used cash of $158.3 million, due to $88.5 million used for the repurchase of 1.5 million shares of common stock at an average price of $58.33 per share, $66.5 million used for dividend payments, $23.0 million used for payments related to net settlement of employee stock compensation awards, and $8.9 million used for payment related to MiR acquisition contingent consideration, partially offset by $28.5 million from the issuance of common stock under employee stock purchase and stock option plans.\nIn January 2021, May 2021, August 2021 and November 2021, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. Total dividend payments in 2021 were $66.0 million.\nIn January 2020, May 2020, August 2020 and November 2020, our Board of Directors declared a quarterly cash dividend of $0.10 per share. Total dividend payments in 2020 were $66.5 million.\nIn January 2020, our Board of Directors cancelled the January 2018 stock repurchase program and approved a new stock repurchase program for up to $1.0 billion in common stock. On April 1, 2020, we suspended the share repurchase program. In 2020, we repurchased 1.5 million shares of common stock for $88.5 million at an average price per share of $58.33.\nIn January 2021, our Board of Directors approved a new repurchase program for up to $2.0 billion of common stock. Unless terminated by resolution of our Board of Directors, the repurchase program will expire when we have repurchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the share repurchase program. In 2021, we repurchased 4.8 million shares of common stock for $600.0 million at an average price of $125.74 per share. We intend to repurchase a minimum of $750.0 million in 2022.\nWhile we declared a quarterly cash dividend and authorized a share repurchase program, we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend or share repurchase program in the future. Future cash dividends and stock repurchases are subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors, which will consider, among other things, our earnings, capital requirements and financial condition.\nOn May 1, 2020, we entered into a credit agreement providing a three-year, senior secured revolving credit facility of $400 million. On December 10, 2021, the credit agreement was amended to extend the senior secured revolving credit facility to December 10, 2026. As of February 23, 2022, we have not borrowed any funds under the credit facility.\nWe expect operations to continue to be the primary source of cash to operate the business and meet material cash commitments, including any payments of convertible debt principal, our stock repurchase program, our\n38\nquarterly dividends, our office lease obligations, contractual obligations related to inventory purchases and the construction of new facilities. We believe our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance will be sufficient to pay our quarterly dividend and meet our working capital and expenditure needs for at least the next twelve months. Inflation has not had a significant long-term impact on earnings. At this time, the\nCOVID-19\npandemic has not had an impact on our liquidity, but there is no assurance that continued impacts resulting from the pandemic will not have an adverse effect in the future.\nAt December 31, 2021, our future contractual obligations were related to debt, leases, retirement plan liabilities, deferred tax benefits, and purchase obligations. See Note J. “Debt”, Note I. “Leases”, Note P. “Retirement Plans”, and Note S. “Income Taxes” of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in this Annual Report for information about those obligations, which Notes are incorporated by reference into this section. Our purchase obligations were approximately $884.3 million, with $839.2 million expected to be paid within 12 months.\nRetirement Plans\nASC\n715-20,\n“\nCompensation—Retirement Benefits—Defined Benefit Plans,\n” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by ASC\n715-20.\nThe pension asset or liability represents the difference between the fair value of the pension plans’ assets and the projected benefit obligation as of December 31. For other postretirement benefit plans, the liability is the difference between the fair value of the plan’s assets and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation as of December 31.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our pension expense, which includes the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan (“U.S. Plan”), certain qualified plans for\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries, and a U.S. Supplemental Executive Defined Benefit Plan, was approximately $1.8 million. Pension expense is calculated based upon a number of actuarial assumptions. Discount rate and expected return on assets are two assumptions which are important elements of pension plan expense and asset/liability measurement. We evaluate our discount rate and expected rate of return on assets assumptions annually on a plan and country specific basis. We evaluate other assumptions related to demographic factors, such as retirement age, mortality and turnover periodically, and update them to reflect our experience and expectations for the future.\nIn developing the expected return on U.S. Plan assets assumption, we evaluated input from our investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. We believe that 2.4% was an appropriate rate of return on assets to use for 2021. The December 31, 2021 asset allocation for our U.S. Plan was 94% invested in fixed income securities, 5% invested in equity securities, and 1% invested in other securities. Our investment manager regularly reviews the actual asset allocation and periodically rebalances the portfolio to ensure alignment with our target allocations.\nWe recognize net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of plan assets in our operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. We calculate the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.\nThe discount rate that we utilized for determining future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on the FTSE Pension Index adjusted for the U.S. Plan’s expected cash flows and was 2.65% at December 31, 2021, up from 2.3% at December 31, 2020. We estimate that in 2022 we will recognize approximately $1.8 million of pension expense for the U.S. Plan. The U.S. Plan pension expense estimate for 2022 is based on a 2.65% discount rate and a 2.0% return on assets. Future pension expense or income will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the employee population participating in our pension plans.\n39\nAs of December 31, 2021, our pension plans had no unrecognized pension prior service cost.\nThe assets of the U.S. Plan consist substantially of fixed income securities. U.S. Plan assets have decreased from $158.9 million at December 31, 2020 to $149.6 million at December 31, 2021, while the U.S. Plan’s liability decreased from $141.4 million at December 31, 2020 to $134.5 million at December 31, 2021. In 2021, the decrease in plan assets and plan liability was due to an increase in interest rates. In 2020, the accrued pension obligations for approximately 115 retiree participants were transferred to an insurance company and resulted in a $24.4 million reduction in the pension benefit obligation and pension assets. We recorded $2.2 million of pension actuarial loss and a settlement loss of $0.5 million related to the retiree group annuity transaction.\nOur funding policy is to make contributions to our pension plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2021, we made contributions of $3.3 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan, and $1.0 million to certain qualified plans for\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries. In 2022, we expect to contribute approximately $3.3 million to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan. Contributions to be made in 2022 to certain qualified plans for\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries are based on local statutory requirements and are estimated at approximately $1.0 million.\nEquity Compensation Plans\nIn addition to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan discussed in Note Q: “Stock-Based Compensation” in Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, we have a 2006 Equity and Cash Compensation Incentive Plan (the “2006 Equity Plan”) under which equity securities are authorized for issuance. The 2006 Equity Plan was initially approved by stockholders on May 25, 2006.\nAt our annual meeting of stockholders held May 21, 2013, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 10.0 million, for an aggregate of 32.0 million shares issuable thereunder, and our stockholders also approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 5.0 million, for an aggregate of 30.4 million shares issuable thereunder. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 12, 2015, our stockholders approved an amendment to the 2006 Equity Plan to extend its term until May 12, 2025. At our annual meeting of stockholders held May 7, 2021, our stockholders approved an amendment to our 1996 Employee Stock Purchase Plan to increase the number of shares issuable thereunder by 3.0 million, for an aggregate of 33.4 million shares issuable thereunder.\nThe following table presents information about these plans as of December 31, 2021 (share numbers in thousands):\nThe purpose of the 2006 Equity Plan is to motivate employees, officers and directors by providing equity ownership and compensation opportunities in Teradyne. The aggregate number of shares available under the 2006 Equity Plan as of December 31, 2021 was 5,711,709 shares of our common stock. The 2006 Equity Plan authorizes the grant of stock-based awards in the form of\n(1) non-qualified\nand incentive stock options, (2) stock\n40\nappreciation rights, (3) restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards, (4) phantom stock, and (5) other stock-based awards. Awards may be tied to time-based vesting schedules and/or performance-based vesting measured by reference to performance criteria chosen by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors, which administers the 2006 Equity Plan. Awards may be made to any employee, officer, consultant and advisor of Teradyne and our subsidiaries, as well as, to our directors. The maximum number of shares of stock-based awards that may be granted to one participant during any one fiscal year is 2,000,000 shares of common stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized compensation expense related to\nnon-vested\nrestricted stock units and options was $50.6 million and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 2.4 years.\nPerformance Graph\nThe following graph compares the change in our cumulative total shareholder return in our common stock with (i) the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index and (ii) the Morningstar Global Semiconductor Equipment & Materials GR USD Industry Group. The comparison assumes $100.00 was invested on December 31, 2016 in our common stock and in each of the foregoing indices and assumes reinvestment of dividends, if any. Historic stock price performance is not necessarily indicative of future price performance.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU\n2020-06\n– “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. This ASU requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives. This ASU requires an entity to use the\nif-converted\nmethod in the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments. This ASU permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition.\n41\nOn November 4, 2021, we made an irrevocable election under the indenture to require the principal portion of the remaining Notes to be settled in cash. Upon adoption of ASU\n2020-06\nonly the amounts settled in excess of the principal will be considered in diluted earnings per share under the\nif-converted\nmethod. We have adopted the standard effective January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method of transition. As a result of adoption, we expect to record an entry to increase current debt, debt, and retained earnings by $1.5 million, $6.5 million, and $92.8 million, respectively. Mezzanine equity and additional\npaid-in\ncapital are expected to be reduced by $100.8 million combined. The adoption of ASU\n2020-06\nwill have an immaterial impact on our results of operations, statement of cash flows, and earnings per share (“EPS”)."

    "text": "Concentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasuries and government agencies. Our fixed income\navailable-for-sale\nmarketable securities have a minimum rating of AA by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. We place forward currency contracts with high credit-quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. We perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable. There were no customers who accounted for more than 10% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2020, JA Mitsui Leasing, Ltd. accounted for 25% of our accounts receivable balance. The balance was paid in full as of February 22, 2021.\nIn addition to market risks described in our Annual Report on Form\n10-K,\nwe have an equity price risk related to the fair value of our convertible senior unsecured notes issued in December 2016. In December 2016, Teradyne issued $460 million aggregate principal amount of 1.25% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due December 15, 2023. As of December 31, 2021, $117.0 million of principal remained outstanding and the Notes had a fair value of $604.6 million. The table below provides a sensitivity analysis of hypothetical 10% changes of Teradyne’s stock price as of the end of the last quarter of 2021 and the estimated impact on the fair value of the Notes. The selected scenarios are not predictions of future events, but rather are intended to illustrate the effect such event may have on the fair value of the Notes. The fair value of the Notes is subject to equity price risk due to the convertible feature. The fair value of the Notes will generally increase as Teradyne’s common stock price increases and will generally decrease as the common stock price declines in value. The change in stock price affects the fair value of the Notes, but does not impact Teradyne’s financial position, cash flows or results of operations due to the fixed nature of the debt obligation. Additionally, we carry the Notes at face value less unamortized discount on our balance sheet, and we present the fair value for required disclosure purposes only. In connection with the offering of the Notes we also sold warrants to the option counterparties. These transactions have been accounted for as an adjustment to our shareholders’ equity. The convertible note hedge transactions are expected to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the Notes. The warrants along with any shares issuable upon conversion of the Notes will have a dilutive effect on our earnings per share to the extent that the average market price of our common stock for a given reporting period exceeds the applicable strike price or conversion price of the warrants or Notes, respectively.\nSee Note J: “Debt” for further information.\n42\nExchange Rate Risk Management\nWe regularly enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the value of our monetary assets and liabilities in Japanese Yen, British Pound, Korean Won, Taiwan Dollar, Singapore Dollar, Euro, Philippine Peso, Chinese Yuan, and Danish Krone. These foreign currency forward contracts have maturities of approximately one month. These contracts are used to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities. We do not engage in currency speculation.\nWe performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical 10% fluctuation in foreign exchange rates to the hedging contracts and the underlying exposures described above. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the analysis indicated that these hypothetical market movements would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nWe are exposed to potential losses due to changes in interest rates. Our interest rate exposure is primarily related to short-term and long-term marketable securities.\nIn order to estimate the potential loss due to interest rate risk, a fluctuation in interest rates of 25 basis points was assumed. Market risk for the short and long-term marketable securities was estimated as the potential change in the fair value resulting from a hypothetical change in interest rates for securities contained in the investment portfolio. The potential change in the fair value from changes in interest rates is immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n43"

    "text": "Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Teradyne, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Teradyne, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, convertible common shares and shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 appearing under Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nChanges in Accounting Principles\nAs discussed in Note B to the consolidated financial statements, the Company changed the manner in which it accounts for leases in 2019.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our\n44\naudits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nConversions of Senior Unsecured Notes\nAs described in Notes B and J to the consolidated financial statements, during 2021, sixty four holders of the Company’s convertible senior unsecured notes, originally issued on December 12, 2016, converted $343.0 million of the senior unsecured notes, resulting in a loss of $28.8 million recorded to other (income) expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The Company may satisfy its conversion obligation by paying cash for the principal amount of the senior unsecured notes and paying or delivering cash, shares of the Company’s common stock or a combination of cash and shares of the Company’s common stock, at management’s election for the amount in excess of principal. Management determined the conversion value of the conversion transactions by calculating the fair value of debt immediately prior to conversion using an updated remaining expected life of the debt instrument and an updated borrowing rate for a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the conversions of senior unsecured notes is a critical audit matter are (i) the high degree of audit effort in performing procedures and evaluating management’s determination of the conversion values of the conversion transactions and the related settlement calculations and (ii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness\n45\nof controls relating to management’s review of conversion transactions related to the Company’s senior unsecured notes, which included controls related to the conversion values and related settlement calculations. These procedures also included, among others, on a test basis (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the conversion and settlement accounting; (ii) testing management’s process for determining the conversion values; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of inputs used in determining the conversion values; and (iv) recalculating the settlement amounts. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the conversion and settlement accounting.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nFebruary 2\n3\n, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1968.\n46\nTERADYNE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n47\nTERADYNE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n48\nTERADYNE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n49\nTERADYNE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CONVERTIBLE COMMON SHARES\nAND SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n50\nTERADYNE, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements.\n51\nTERADYNE, INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA.    THE COMPANY\nTeradyne, Inc. (“Teradyne”) is a leading global supplier of automation equipment for test and industrial applications. Teradyne designs, develops, manufactures and sells automatic test systems used to test semiconductors, wireless products, data storage and complex electronics systems in many industries including consumer electronics, wireless, automotive, industrial, computing, communications, and aerospace and defense industries. Teradyne’s industrial automation products include collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots, and advanced robotic control software used by global manufacturing, logistics and light industrial customers to improve quality, increase manufacturing and material handling efficiency and decrease manufacturing and logistics costs. Teradyne’s automatic test equipment and industrial automation products and services include:\nOn January 30, 2019, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (“Lemsys”) for a total purchase price of approximately $\n9.1\nmillion. Lemsys strengthens Teradyne’s position in the electrification of vehicles, solar and wind power, and industrial applications. Lemsys is included in Teradyne’s Semiconductor Test segment.\nOn June 3, 2019, Teradyne invested $\n15.0\nmillion in RealWear, Inc. (“RealWear”). RealWear, a private company, develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial, hands-free, head-mounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive. On February 28, 2020, RealWear’s debt holder demanded repayment of its $\n25.0\nmillion loan to RealWear. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Teradyne recorded an impairment charge of $\n15.0\nmillion to reduce its investment in RealWear to\nzero\nas of December 31, 2019.\nOn November 13, 2019, Teradyne acquired\n100\n% of the membership interests of AutoGuide, LLC (“AutoGuide”), a maker of high payload AMRs, an emerging and fast-growing segment of the global forklift market. The total purchase price was approximately $\n81.6\nmillion, which included cash paid of approximately $\n57.6\nmillion and $\n24.0\nmillion in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain performance targets, extending potentially through 2022. At December 31, 2021, the maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is $\n87.7\nmillion. AutoGuide’s AMRs are used for material transport of payloads up to\n4,500\nkg in manufacturing, warehouse and logistics applications. These products complement MiR’s lower payload products. AutoGuide is included in our Industrial Automation segment.\nOn June 1, 2021, Teradyne invested $\n12.0\nmillion in MachineMetrics, Inc. (“MachineMetrics”), a private company that develops and sells products to improve manufacturing performance through automated machine data collection, alerting, and analytics. Teradyne’s investment in MachineMetrics aligns with its strategy of providing and investing in leading edge products for automating industrial production processes in growing markets. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. At December 31, 2021, the value of the investment was $\n12.0\nmillion, and there was\nno\nchange during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n52\nB.    ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Teradyne and its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated. Certain prior years’ amounts were reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nPreparation of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent liabilities. On an on-going basis, management evaluates its estimates, including those related to inventories, investments, goodwill, intangible and other long-lived assets, accounts receivable, income taxes, deferred tax assets and liabilities, pensions, warranties, contingent consideration liabilities, and loss contingencies. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on appropriate and customary assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the global economy and our markets. Management is not aware of any specific event or circumstance that would require an update to its estimates or judgments or a revision of the carrying value of its assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change, as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nIn accordance with ASC 606, Teradyne recognizes revenues, when or as control is transferred to a customer. Teradyne’s determination of revenue is dependent upon a five-step process outlined below.\n53\nPerformance Obligations\nProducts\nTeradyne products consist primarily of semiconductor test systems and instruments, defense/aerospace test instrumentation and systems, storage test systems and instruments, circuit-board test and inspection systems and instruments, wireless test systems and industrial automation products. Teradyne’s hardware is recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer.\nServices\nTeradyne services consist of extended warranties, training and application support, service agreements, post contract customer support (“PCS”) and replacement parts. Each service is recognized based on relative standalone selling price. Extended warranty, training and support, service agreements and PCS are recognized over time based on the period of service. Replacement parts are recognized at a point in time upon transfer of control to the customer.\nTeradyne does not allow customer returns or provide refunds to customers for any products or services. Teradyne products include a standard\n12\n-month warranty. This warranty is not considered a distinct performance obligation because it does not obligate Teradyne to provide a separate service to the customer and it cannot be purchased separately. Cost related to\nwarranties\nare included in cost of revenues when product revenues are recognized.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred revenue and customer advances consisted of the following and are included in the short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances:\n54\nProduct Warranty\nTeradyne generally provides a one-year warranty on its products, commencing upon installation, acceptance or shipment. A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based on historical experience. Related costs are charged to the warranty accrual as incurred. The balance below is included in other accrued liabilities:\nWhen Teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties, beyond one year, it is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. The balance below is included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances:\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. Teradyne maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments. Estimated allowances for doubtful accounts are reviewed periodically taking into account the customer’s recent payment history, the customer’s current financial statements and other information regarding the customer’s credit worthiness. Account balances are written off against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will not be recovered.\n55\nTeradyne sells certain trade accounts receivables on a non-recourse basis to third-party financial institutions pursuant to factoring agreements. Teradyne accounts for these transactions as sales of receivables and presents cash proceeds as a cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Total trade accounts receivable sold under the factoring agreements were $\n111.3\nmillion and $\n131.1\nmillion during 2021 and 2020, respectively. Factoring fees for the sales of receivables are recorded in interest expense and are not material.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out basis) or net realizable value. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne uses consistent methodologies to evaluate all inventories for net realizable value. Teradyne records a provision for both excess and obsolete inventory when such write-downs or write-offs are identified through the quarterly review process. The inventory valuation is based upon assumptions about future demand, product mix and possible alternative uses.\nInvestments\nTeradyne accounts for its investments in debt and equity securities in accordance with the provisions of ASC 320-10, “\nInvestments—Debt and Equity Securities\n.” ASC 320-10 requires that certain debt and equity securities be classified into one of three categories; trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity securities. On a quarterly basis, Teradyne reviews its investments to identify and evaluate those that have an indication of a potential other-than-temporary impairment. Factors considered in determining whether a loss is other-than-temporary include:\nTeradyne uses the market and income approach techniques to value its financial instruments and there were no changes in valuation techniques during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nTeradyne measures its debt and equity investments at fair value, in accordance with ASC 820-10 , “\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures.\n” ASC 820-10 defines fair value as the price that would be received from the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants and requires that assets and liabilities carried at fair value be classified and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets as of the reporting date;\nLevel 2: Inputs other than Level 1, that are observable either directly or indirectly as of the reporting date. For example, a common approach for valuing fixed income securities is the use of matrix pricing. Matrix pricing is a mathematical technique used to value securities by relying on the securities’ relationship to other benchmark quoted prices, and is considered a Level 2 input; or\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are not supported by market data. Unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available, which might include Teradyne’s own data.\nTeradyne’s debt investments are classified as Level 2, and equity investments are classified as Level 1. Acquisition-related contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. Teradyne determines the fair value of acquisition-related contingent consideration using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Assumptions utilized in the model include forecasted revenues, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate.\n56\nFinancial Assets and Financial Liabilities\nTeradyne records changes in fair value of equity securities directly in earnings and realized gains and losses in other (income) expense, net, in accordance with ASU 2016-01, “\nFinancial Instruments—Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities\n.”\nPrepayments\nPrepayments consist of the following:\nRetirement and Postretirement Plans\nTeradyne recognizes net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in its operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. Teradyne calculates the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.\nTeradyne reports net periodic pension cost and net periodic postretirement benefit costs in accordance with ASU 2017-07, “\nCompensation—Retirement Benefits (Topic 715): Improving the Presentation of Net Periodic Pension Cost and Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Cost\n.” The service cost component of net benefit costs is reported in the same line item in the consolidated statement of operations as other employee compensation costs. The non-service components of net benefit costs such as interest cost, expected return on assets, amortization of prior service cost, and actuarial gains or losses, are reported within other (income) expense, net.\nGoodwill, Intangible and Long-Lived Assets\nTeradyne accounts for goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350-10, “\nIntangibles-Goodwill and Other.\n” Intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic life and are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually in the fourth quarter, as of December 31, on a reporting unit basis, or more frequently when events and circumstances occur indicating that the recorded goodwill may be impaired.\nIn accordance with ASC 350-10, Teradyne has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If Teradyne determines this is the case, Teradyne is required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. If Teradyne determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amounts, a quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required.\nIn accordance with ASC 360-10, “\nImpairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets,\n” Teradyne reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate. Each impairment test is based on a comparison of the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the\nrecorded value of the asset. If impairment is indicated, the asset is written down to its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flows analysis. The cash flows estimates used to determine the impairment, if any, contain management’s best estimates using appropriate assumptions and projections at that time.\n57\nBusiness Combination\nTeradyne recognizes the tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. The fair value of identifiable intangible assets is based on detailed cash flows valuations that use information and assumptions provided by management. Teradyne estimates the fair value of contingent consideration at the time of the acquisition using all pertinent information known to us at the time to assess the probability of payment of contingent amounts or through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. Teradyne allocates any excess purchase price over the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed to goodwill. The assumptions used in the valuations for our acquisitions may differ materially from actual results depending on performance of the acquired businesses and other factors. While Teradyne believes the assumptions used were appropriate, different assumptions in the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed could have a material impact on the timing and extent of impact on our statements of operations. Goodwill is assigned to reporting units as of the date of the related acquisition.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated over the estimated useful lives of the assets. Leasehold improvements and major renewals are capitalized and included in property, plant and equipment accounts, while expenditures for maintenance and repairs and minor renewals are charged to expense. When assets are retired, the assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in the consolidated statements of operations.\nTeradyne provides for depreciation of its assets principally on the straight-line method with the cost of the assets being charged to expense over their useful lives as follows:\nTest systems manufactured internally are used by Teradyne for customer evaluations and manufacturing and support of its customers. Teradyne depreciates the test systems manufactured internally over a\nsix-year\nlife to cost of revenues, engineering and development, and selling and administrative expenses. Teradyne often sells internally manufactured test equipment to customers. Upon the sale of an internally manufactured test system, the net book value of the system is transferred to inventory and expensed as cost of revenues. The net book value of internally manufactured test systems sold in the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n16.6\nmillion, $\n7.3\nmillion, and $\n5.0\nmillion, respectively.\nConvertible Debt\nIn accordance with ASC\n815-40,\n“Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” the convertible note hedge is classified in stockholders’ equity in the statements of financial position because it is indexed to Teradyne’s stock. The criteria as set forth in ASC\n815-40\nwere evaluated by Teradyne. In reviewing the criteria, Teradyne noted the following: (1) the convertible note hedge does not require Teradyne to issue shares; (2) there is no requirement to net cash settle the convertible note hedge for failure to make timely filings with the SEC; (3) in the case of termination, the convertible note hedge is settled in the same consideration as the holders of the underlying stock; (4) the counterparty does not have rights that rank higher than those of a shareholder of the stock underlying the convertible note hedge; and (5) there is no requirement to post collateral. Based on its analysis of those criteria, Teradyne concluded that the convertible note hedge should be recorded in equity and no further adjustment should be made in future periods to adjust the value of the convertible note hedge.\n58\nTeradyne analyzed the Warrant Transactions under ASC\n815-40,\n“Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” and other relevant literature, and determined that it met the criteria for classification as an equity transaction and is considered indexed to Teradyne’s stock. As a result, Teradyne recorded the proceeds from the warrants as an increase to additional\npaid-in\ncapital. Teradyne does not recognize subsequent changes in fair value of the warrants in its financial statements.\nThe provisions\nof ASC 470-20, “Debt with Conversion and Other Options,” are applicable to the Notes. ASC 470-20 requires Teradyne to separately account for the liability (debt) and equity (conversion feature) components of the Notes in a manner that reflects Teradyne’s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate at the date of issuance when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods. Teradyne allocated $\n100.8\nmillion of the initial $\n460.0\nmillion principal amount of the Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount to the debt and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through December 2023.\nIn accounting for the conversions of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the original December 12, 2016 agreement, Teradyne calculated gain or loss on extinguishment equal to the difference between the calculated fair value of the debt immediately prior to its conversion and the carrying amount of the debt component including any unamortized debt discount or issuance costs. The calculated gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Teradyne determined the conversion value of the conversion transactions by calculating the fair value of debt immediately prior to conversion using an updated remaining expected life of the debt instrument and an updated borrowing rate for a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature.\nIn accounting for the conversions of the Notes pursuant to the terms of the original December 12, 2016 agreement, Teradyne calculated gain or loss on extinguishment equal to the difference between the calculated fair value of the debt immediately prior to its conversion and the carrying amount of the debt component including any unamortized debt discount or issuance costs. The calculated gain or loss is recorded in the consolidated statement of operations. Teradyne determined the conversion value of the conversion transactions by calculating the fair value of debt immediately prior to conversion using an updated remaining expected life of the debt instrument and an updated borrowing rate for a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature.\nLeases\nTeradyne adopted Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2016-02, “\nLeases (Topic 842)\n” (“Topic 842”) and the related amendments (collectively “ASC 842”) on January 1, 2019 and utilized the modified retrospective approach provided by ASU 2018-11, “\nLeases (Topic 842): Targeted Improvements\n,” that allowed for a cumulative effect adjustment in the period of adoption.\nUnder ASC 842, a contract is or contains a lease when Teradyne has the right to control the use of an identified asset. Teradyne determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract, which is the date on which the terms of the contract are agreed to and the agreement creates enforceable rights and obligations. The commencement date of the lease is the date that the lessor makes an underlying asset available for use by Teradyne. As of December 31, 2021, Teradyne does not have material leases that have not yet commenced.\nTeradyne determines if the lease is an operating or finance lease at the lease commencement date based upon the terms of the lease and the nature of the asset. The lease term used to calculate the lease liability includes options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised.\nFor leases commencing after January 1, 2019, the lease liability is measured at the present value of future lease payments, discounted using the discount rate for the lease at the commencement date. As Teradyne is typically unable to determine the implicit rate, Teradyne uses an incremental borrowing rate based on the lease term and economic environment at commencement date. Teradyne initially measures payments based on an index by using the applicable rate at lease commencement. Variable payments that do not depend on an index are\n59\nnot included in the lease liability and are recognized as they are incurred. The ROU asset is initially measured as the amount of lease liability, adjusted for any initial lease costs, prepaid lease payments, and reduced by any lease incentives.\nTeradyne’s contracts often include\nnon-lease\ncomponents such as common area maintenance. Teradyne elected the practical expedient to account for the lease and\nnon-lease\ncomponents as a single lease component. For leases with a term of one year or less, Teradyne has elected not to record the lease asset or liability. The lease payments are recognized in the consolidated statement of earnings on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Teradyne includes lease costs within cost of revenues and operating expenses. See Note I: “Leases.”\nEngineering and Development Costs\nTeradyne’s products are highly technical in nature and require a large and continuing engineering and development effort. Software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are charged to expense. Software development costs incurred subsequent to the establishment of technological feasibility are capitalized until the product is available for release to customers. To date, the period between achieving technological feasibility and general availability of the product has been short and software development costs eligible for capitalization have not been material. Engineering and development costs are expensed as incurred and consist primarily of salaries, contractor fees including non-recurring engineering charges related to product design, allocated facility costs, depreciation, and tooling costs.\nStock Compensation Plans and Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nStock-based compensation expense is based on the grant-date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of ASC 718-10, “\nCompensation-Stock Compensation\n.” Teradyne elects to account for forfeitures by applying an estimated forfeiture rate and recognizes compensation costs only for those stock-based compensation awards expected to vest. Under its stock compensation plans, Teradyne has granted stock options, restricted stock units and performance-based restricted stock units, and employees are eligible to purchase Teradyne’s common stock through its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\nExcess tax benefits or tax deficiencies are recognized as a discrete tax benefit or discrete tax expense to the current income tax provision in Teradyne’s consolidated statements of operations, all excess tax benefits related to share-based payments are reported as cash flows from operating activities, and all cash payments made to taxing authorities on the employees’ behalf for withheld shares are presented as financing activities on the statement of cash flows.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse. The measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Teradyne performed the required assessment of positive and negative evidence regarding the realization of the net deferred tax assets in accordance with ASC 740,\n“Accounting for Income Taxes.”\nThis assessment included the evaluation of scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities, estimates of projected future taxable income and tax-planning strategies. Although realization is not assured, based on its assessment, Teradyne concluded that it is more likely than not that such assets, net of the existing valuation allowance, will be realized.\nAdvertising Costs\nTeradyne expenses all advertising costs as incurred. Advertising costs were $\n13.4\nmillion, $\n12.8\nmillion and $\n16.6\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n60\nTranslation of\nNon-U.S.\nCurrencies\nThe functional currency for all\nnon-U.S.\nsubsidiaries is the U.S. dollar, except for Universal Robots, MiR and Lemsys for which the local currency is its functional currency. All foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities are remeasured on a monthly basis into the functional currency using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. All foreign currency denominated\nnon-monetary\nassets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency using historical exchange rates. Net foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other (income) expense, net. For Universal Robots, MiR and Lemsys, assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. Revenues and expense amounts are translated using an average of exchange rates in effect during the period. Translation adjustments are recorded within accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet.\nNet foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from remeasurement are included in other (income) expense, net. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, (gains) losses from the remeasurement of the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were $(\n2.1\n) million, $\n2.6\nmillion, and $(\n1.6\n) million, respectively.\nThese amounts do not reflect the corresponding (gains) losses from foreign exchange contracts. See Note H: “Financial Instruments” regarding foreign exchange contracts.\nNet Income per Common Share\nBasic net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Except where the result would be anti-dilutive, diluted net income per common share is calculated by dividing net income by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares plus common stock equivalents, if applicable.\nWith respect to its convertible debt issued in 2016, Teradyne is required to settle the principal of the convertible debt in cash; accordingly, the principal amount is excluded from the determination of diluted earnings per share. As a result, Teradyne is accounting for the conversion spread using the treasury stock method.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income includes net income, unrealized pension and postretirement prior service costs and benefits, unrealized gains and losses on investments in debt marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustment.\nC.    RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nIn August 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”)\n2020-06\n– “Debt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity,” which simplifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments by reducing the number of accounting models and the number of embedded conversion features that could be recognized separately from the primary contract. This ASU requires a convertible debt instrument to be accounted for as a single liability measured at its amortized cost, as long as no other features require bifurcation and recognition as derivatives, and it requires an entity to use the\nif-converted\nmethod in the diluted earnings per share calculation for convertible instruments. This ASU permits the use of either the modified retrospective or fully retrospective method of transition.\nOn November 4, 2021, Teradyne made an irrevocable election under the indenture entered into between Teradyne and Wilmington Trust, National Association, as trustee (the “Indenture”) for the issuance of the\n1.25\n% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due\nDecember 15, 2023\nto require the principal portion of the\n61\nremaining Notes to be settled in cash. Upon adoption of ASU 2020-06, only the amounts settled in excess of the principal will be considered in diluted earnings per share under the if-converted method. Teradyne has adopted the standard effective January 1, 2022 using the modified retrospective method of transition. As a result of adoption Teradyne expects to record an entry to increase current debt, debt, and retained earnings by\n$\n1.5\nmillion, $\n6.5\nmillion, and $\n92.8\nmillion, respectively. Mezzanine equity and additional paid-in capital are expected to be reduced by\n$\n100.8\nmillion combined. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 will have an immaterial impact on our results of operations, statement of cash flows, and earnings per share.\nD.    ACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENT\nS\nIN OTHER COMPANY\nAcquisitions\nAutoGuide LLC\nOn November 13, 2019, Teradyne acquired\n100\n% of the membership interests of AutoGuide, LLC (“AutoGuide”), a maker of high-payload AMRs, based in Chelmsford, MA, an emerging and fast growing segment of the global forklift market. The total purchase price was approximately $\n81.6\nmillion, which included cash paid of approximately $\n57.6\nmillion and $\n24.0\nmillion in fair value of contingent consideration payable upon achievement of certain performance targets, extending potentially through 2022. At December 31, 2021, the maximum contingent consideration that could be paid is $\n87.7\nmillion.\nThe contingent consideration is payable upon achievement of certain thresholds and targets for revenue and earnings before interest and taxes for periods from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2020, January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021, and January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2022.\nThe valuation of the contingent consideration is dependent on the following assumptions: forecasted revenues, revenue volatility, earnings before interest and taxes, and discount rate. These assumptions were estimated based on a review of the historical and projected results.\nThe AutoGuide acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, the results have been included in Teradyne’s consolidated results of operations from the date of acquisition. AutoGuide’s AMRs are used for material transport of payloads up to\n4,500\nkg in manufacturing, warehouse and logistics applications. These products complement Mobile Industrial Robots A/S (“MiR”) lower payload products and expand the Industrial Automation segment, which is a key component of Teradyne’s growth strategy\n.\nAutoGuide’s results have been included in Teradyne’s Industrial Automation segment from the date of acquisition.\nFor the period from November 13,\n2019\nto December 31, 2019, AutoGuide contributed $\n1.4\nmillion of revenues and had a $(\n0.9\n) million loss before income taxes.\nPro Forma Information\nThe following unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition of AutoGuide as if the acquisition occurred on January 1, 2018.\nThe unaudited pro forma results are not necessarily indicative of what actually would have occurred had the acquisition been in effect for the periods presented:\n62\nPro forma results for the year ended December 31, 2019 were adjusted to exclude $\n1.2\nmillion of AutoGuide acquisition related costs and\n$\n0.1\nmillion of AutoGuide non-recurring expense related to fair value adjustment to acquisition-date inventory.\nLemsys SA\nOn January 30, 2019, Teradyne acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Lemsys SA (“Lemsys”) for a total purchase price of approximately $\n9.1\nmillion. Lemsys strengthens Teradyne’s position in the electrification trends of vehicles, solar and wind power, and industrial applications. The Lemsys acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and, accordingly, the results have been included in Teradyne’s Semiconductor Test segment from the date of acquisition. Teradyne’s final allocation of the purchase price was goodwill of $\n1.4\nmillion, which is not deductible for tax purposes, acquired intangible assets of $\n4.6\nmillion with an average estimated useful life of\n5.2\nyears, and $\n3.1\nmillion of net tangible assets. The acquisition was not material to Teradyne’s consolidated financial statements.\nInvestment\ns\nin Other Company\nOn June 1, 2021, Teradyne invested $\n12.0\nmillion in MachineMetrics, Inc.\n(“MachineMetrics”), a private company that develops and sells products to improve manufacturing performance through automated machine data collection, alerting, and analytics. Teradyne’s investment in MachineMetrics aligns with its strategy of providing and investing in leading edge products for automating industrial production processes in growing markets. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. At December 31\n, 2021\n, the value of the investment was $\n12.0\nmillion, and there was\nno\nchange during the year ended December 31\n, 2021\n.\nOn June 3,\n2019\n, Teradyne invested $\n15.0\nmillion in RealWear, Inc. (“RealWear”). RealWear, a private company, develops and sells advanced wearable technology including industrial, hands-free, head-mounted augmented reality devices that make the workplace safer and more productive. The investment was recorded at cost and is evaluated for impairment or an indication of changes in fair value resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer on a quarterly basis. On February 28, 2020, RealWear’s debt holder demanded repayment of its $\n25.0\nmillion loan to RealWear. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2019, Teradyne recorded an impairment charge of $\n15.0\nmillion to reduce its investment in RealWear to\nzero\nas of December 31, 2019.\n63\nE.    REVENUE\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following table provides information about disaggregated revenue by timing of revenue recognition, primary geographical market, and major product lines.\nContract Balances\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne recognized $\n102.5\nmillion, $\n91.0\nmillion and $\n65.6\nmillion, respectively, that was included within the deferred revenue and customer advances balances at the beginning of the period. This revenue primarily relates to undelivered hardware, extended warranties, training, application support, and post contract support. Each of these represents a distinct performance\n64\nobligation. As of December 31,\n2021\n, Teradyne has $\n1,306.0\nmillion of unsatisfied performance obligations. Teradyne expects to recognize\n92\n% of the remaining performance obligation in the next\n12\nmonths,\n8\n% in\n1\n-\n3\nyears, and the remainder thereafter\n.\nF.    INVENTORIES\nInventories, net consisted of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nInventory reserves for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n114.1\nmillion and $\n110.6\nmillion, respectively.\nG.    PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nProperty, plant and equipment, net consisted of the following at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nDepreciation of property, plant and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n91.1\nmillion, $\n80.1\nmillion, and $\n70.8\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the gross book value included in machinery and equipment for internally manufactured test systems being leased by customers was $\n13.4\nmillion and $\n23.4\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the accumulated depreciation on these test systems was $\n8.7\nmillion and $\n7.5\nmillion, respectively.\nH.    FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nCash Equivalents\nTeradyne considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition to be cash equivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nTeradyne recognizes the changes in fair value of equity securities directly in earnings. Teradyne’s\navailable-for-sale\ndebt securities are classified as Level 2, and equity and debt mutual funds are classified as Level 1. Contingent consideration is classified as Level 3. The vast majority of Level 2 securities are fixed\n65\nincome securities priced by third party pricing vendors. These pricing vendors utilize the most recent observable market information in pricing these securities or, if specific prices are not available, use other observable inputs like market transactions involving identical or comparable securities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no transfers in or out of Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3 financial instruments.\nRealized gains recorded in 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $\n3.1\nmillion, $\n4.6\nmillion, and $\n1.3\nmillion, respectively.\nNo\nrealized losses were recorded in 2021. Realized losses recorded in 2020 and 2019 were $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion, respectively. Realized gains and losses are included in other (income) expense, net.\nUnrealized gains on equity securities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n5.1\nmillion and $\n9.6\nmillion, respectively. Unrealized losses on equity securities recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n1.8\nmillion and $\n6.0\nmillion, respectively. Unrealized gains and losses on equity securities are included in other (income) expense, net. Unrealized gains and losses on\navailable-for-sale debt securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the balance sheet.\nThe cost of securities sold is based on average cost.\nThe following table sets forth by fair value hierarchy Teradyne’s financial assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n66\nReported as follows:\n67\nReported as follows:\nChanges in the fair value of Level 3 contingent consideration for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n68\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of Teradyne’s financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nThe fair values of accounts receivable, net and accounts payable approximate the carrying amount due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nThe following tables summarize the composition of\navailable-for-sale\nmarketable securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nReported as follows:\n69\nReported as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair market value of investments with unrealized losses less than one year and greater than one year totaled $\n85.4\nmillion and $\n6.5\nmillion, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2020, the fair market value of investments with unrealized losses less than one year totaled $\n70.4\nmillion.\nTeradyne reviews its investments to identify and evaluate investments that have an indication of possible impairment. Based on this review, Teradyne determined that the unrealized losses related to these investments at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not other than temporary.\nThe contractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale marketable securities held at December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nContractual maturities of investments in available-for-sale marketable securities held at December 31, 2021 exclude debt mutual funds with the fair market value of $\n8.0\nmillion as they do not have a contractual maturity date.\n70\nDerivatives\nTeradyne conducts business in a number of foreign countries, with certain transactions denominated in local currencies. The purpose of Teradyne’s foreign currency management is to minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on certain foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities. Teradyne does not use derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nTo minimize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations associated with the remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, Teradyne enters into foreign currency forward contracts. The change in fair value of these derivatives is recorded directly in earnings and is used to offset the change in value of the monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, Teradyne had the following contracts to buy and sell non-U.S. currencies for U.S. dollars and other non-U.S. currencies with the following notional amounts:\nThe fair value of the outstanding contracts was a loss of $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.4\nmillion, respectively, at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts and foreign currency remeasurement gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities are included in other (income) expense, net.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n71\nThe following table summarizes the effect of derivative instruments in the statements of operations recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nSee Note J: “Debt” regarding derivatives related to the convertible senior notes.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments which potentially subject Teradyne to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, marketable securities, forward currency contracts and accounts receivable. Teradyne’s cash equivalents consist primarily of money market funds invested in U.S. Treasuries and government agencies. Teradyne’s fixed income available-for-sale marketable securities have a minimum rating of AA by one or more of the major credit rating agencies. Teradyne places foreign currency forward contracts with high credit-quality financial institutions in order to minimize credit risk exposure. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to accounts receivable are limited due to the large number of geographically dispersed customers. Teradyne performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition and from time to time may require customers to provide a letter of credit from a bank to secure accounts receivable.\nThere were no customers who accounted for more than\n10\n% of our accounts receivable balance as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2020, a customer of our Semiconductor Test segment, JA Mitsui Leasing, LTD, accounted for\n25\n% of our accounts receivable balance. The balance was paid in full as of February 22, 2021.\nI.    LEASES\nTeradyne has facility and auto leases, which are accounted for as operating leases. Teradyne’s facility leases are primarily used for administrative functions, research and development, manufacturing, and storage and distribution. Remaining lease terms range from less than one year to twelve years.\nTotal lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n39.2\nmillion and included $\n12.6\nmillion of variable lease costs and $\n1.8\nmillion of costs related to short-term leases, which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.\nTotal lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $\n38.5\nmillion and included $\n12.1\nmillion of variable lease costs and $\n3.4\nmillion of costs related to short-term leases, which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.\nTotal lease expense for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $\n35.6\nmillion and included $\n11.1\nmillion of variable lease costs and $\n2.6\nmillion of costs related to short-term leases, which are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheets.\n72\nAt December\n31, 2021, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for operating leases was\n5.3\nyears and\n4.1\n%, respectively. At December 31, 2020, the weighted average remaining lease term and weighted average discount rate for operating leases was\n4.2\nyears and\n4.8\n%, respectively.\nSupplemental cash flows information related to leases was as follows:\nMaturities of lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nJ.    DEBT\nConvertible Senior Notes\nOn December 12, 2016, Teradyne completed a private offering of $\n460.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n1.25\n% convertible senior unsecured notes (the “Notes”) due\nDecember 15, 2023\nand received net proceeds, after issuance costs, of approximately $\n450.8\nmillion, $\n33.0\nmillion of which was used to pay the net cost of the convertible note hedge transactions and $\n50.1\nmillion of which was used to repurchase\n2.0\nmillion shares of Teradyne’s common stock under its existing stock repurchase program from purchasers of the Notes in privately negotiated transactions effected through one of the initial purchasers or its affiliates conducted concurrently with the pricing of the Note offering. The Notes will mature on December 15, 2023, unless earlier repurchased or converted. The Notes bear interest at a rate of\n1.25\n% per year\npayable semiannually in arrears on\nJune 15 and December 15 of each year.\nThe Notes will be convertible at the option of the noteholders at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding\nSeptember 15, 2023\n, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter beginning after\nMarch 31, 2017\n(and only during such calendar quarter), if the closing sale\nprice\nof Teradyne’s common stock, for at least\n20\ntrading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of\n30\nconsecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than\n130\n% of the conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the\nfive\nbusiness day period after any\nfive\nconsecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price (as defined in the Indenture) per $\n1,000\nprincipal amount of Notes for each trading day of the measurement period was less than\n98\n% of the product of the closing sale price of the Teradyne’s common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day; and (3) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events. On or after\nSeptember 15, 2023\nuntil the close of business on the second scheduled trading day immediately preceding the maturity date, holders may convert their Notes at any time, regardless of the\nforegoing\n73\ncircumstances. Teradyne may satisfy its future conversion obligation by paying cash for the principal amount of the Notes and paying or delivering cash, shares of its common stock or a combination of cash and shares of its common stock, at Teradyne’s election for the amount in excess of principal. As of December 31, 2021, the conversion price was approximately\n$\n31.52\nper share of Teradyne’s common stock. The conversion rate is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.\nDuring 2021 sixty\nfour\nholders converted $\n343.0\nmillion resulting in a loss of $\n28.8\nmillion recorded to other (income) expense on the consolidated statement of operations. The amount of the loss was determined using the conversion value of the conversion transactions based on the fair value of debt immediately prior to conversion using an updated remaining expected life of the debt instrument and an updated borrowing rate for a similar debt instrument that does not have an associated convertible feature.\nAs of February\n23\n, 2022,\neighty three holders had exercised the option to convert\n$\n362.6\nmillion worth of notes. On November 4, 2021, Teradyne made an irrevocable election under the Indenture to require the principal portion of the remaining Notes to be settled in cash.\nConcurrent with the offering of the Notes,\nTeradyne entered into convertible note hedge transactions (the “Note Hedge Transactions”) with the initial purchasers or their affiliates (the “Option Counterparties”). The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the number of shares of the common stock that underlie the Notes, with a strike price equal to the conversion price of the Notes of $\n31.52\n. The Note Hedge Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately\n4.4\nmillion shares of Teradyne’s common stock.\nSeparately and concurrent with the pricing of the Notes, Teradyne entered into warrant transactions with the Option Counterparties (the “Warrant Transactions”) in which it sold net-share-settled (or, at its election subject to certain conditions, cash-settled) warrants to the Option Counterparties. The Warrant Transactions cover, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, approximately\n14.6\nmillion shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021, the strike price of the warrants was approximately $\n39.55\nper share. The strike price is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances. The Warrant Transactions could have a dilutive effect to Teradyne’s common stock to the extent that the market price per share of Teradyne’s common stock, as measured under the terms of the Warrant Transactions, exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrants.\nThe Note Hedge Transactions are expected to reduce the potential dilution to Teradyne’s common stock upon any conversion of the Notes. However, the Warrant Transactions could separately have a dilutive effect to the extent that the market value per share of Teradyne’s common stock exceeds the applicable strike price of the warrant. The net cost of the Note Hedge Transactions, after being partially offset by the proceeds from the sale of the warrants, was approximately $\n33.0\nmillion.\nIn connection with establishing their initial hedge of these convertible note hedge and warrant transactions, the Option Counterparties have entered into various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne’s common stock and/or purchased shares of Teradyne’s common stock or other securities, including the Notes, concurrent with, or shortly after, the pricing of the Notes. In addition, the Option Counterparties may modify their hedge positions by entering into or unwinding various derivative transactions with respect to Teradyne’s common stock or by selling Teradyne’s common stock or other securities, including the Notes, in secondary market transactions (and may do so during any observation period related to the conversion of the Notes). These activities could adversely affect the value of Teradyne’s common stock and the Notes.\nTeradyne allocated $\n100.8\nmillion of the $\n460.0\nmillion principal amount of the Notes to the equity component, which represents a discount to the debt and will be amortized to interest expense using the effective interest method through December 2023. Accordingly, Teradyne’s effective annual interest rate on the Notes will be approximately\n5.0\n%. The Notes are classified as long-term debt on the balance sheet based on\ntheir\nDecember 15, 2023 maturity date. Debt issuance costs of approximately $\n7.2\nmillion are being\namortized to\n74\ninterest expense using the effective\ninterest method over the\nseven-year\nterm of the Notes. As of December 31, 2021, debt issuance costs were approximately $\n0.6\nmillion.\nThe below tables represent the key components of Teradyne’s convertible senior notes:\nReported as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the unamortized discount was $\n8.6\nmillion, which will be amortized over\ntwo years\nusing the effective interest rate method\n,\nt\nhe carrying amount of the equity component was $\n100.8\nmillion,\nthe conversion price was approximately $\n31.52\nper share and if converted the value of the notes was $\n606.9\nmillion.\nAdditional conversions of approximately $\n20.7\nmillion of debt principal will occur in the first quarter of 2022.\nTeradyne expects to make principal interest payments of $\n1.5\nmillion in the next 12 months and $\n1.5\nmillion thereafter.\nThe liability component is included in current debt and the equity component is included in convertible common shares.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn June 27, 2019, Teradyne terminated its credit agreement, which Teradyne entered into with Barclays Bank PLC on April 27, 2015. The terminated credit agreement, which was undrawn at termination, provided for a\nfive-year\n, senior secured revolving credit facility of up to $\n350\nmillion.\nOn May 1, 2020, Teradyne entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) with Truist Bank, as administrative agent and collateral agent, and the lenders party thereto. The Credit Agreement provides for a\nthree-year\n, senior secured revolving credit facility of $\n400.0\nmillion (the “Credit Facility”).\n75\nOn December 10, 2021, the\nCredit Agreement\nwas amended to extend maturity date of the Credit Facility to December 10, 2026. The amended Credit Agreement\nprovides that, subject to customary conditions, Teradyne may seek to obtain from existing or new lenders\nthe available\nincremental\namount\nunder the Credit Facility\n,\nnot\nto exceed\nthe greater of\n$\n200.0\nmillion\nor\n15\n% of consolidated EBIDTA.\nThe interest rate applicable to loans under the Credit Facility are, at Teradyne’s option, equal to either a base rate plus a margin ranging from\n0.00\n% to\n0.75\n% per annum or LIBOR\nplus a margin ranging from\n1.00\n% to\n1.75\n% per annum, based on the consolidated leverage ratio of Teradyne. In addition, Teradyne will pay a commitment fee on the unused portion of the commitments under the Credit Facility ranging from\n0.15\n% to\n0.25\n% per annum, based on the then applicable consolidated leverage ratio.\nTeradyne is not required to repay any loans under the Credit Facility prior to maturity, subject to certain customary exceptions. Teradyne is permitted to prepay all or any portion of the loans under the Credit Facility prior to maturity without premium or penalty, other than customary LIBOR breakage costs.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary events of default, representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants that, among other things, limit Teradyne’s ability to sell assets, grant liens on assets, incur other secured indebtedness and make certain investments and restricted payments, all subject to exceptions set forth in the Credit\nAgreement\n. The Credit Agreement also requires Teradyne to satisfy two financial ratios measured as of the end of each fiscal quarter; a consolidated leverage ratio and an interest coverage ratio.\nThe Credit Facility is guaranteed by certain of Teradyne’s domestic subsidiaries and collateralized by assets of Teradyne and such subsidiaries, including a pledge of\n65\n% of the capital stock of certain foreign subsidiaries.\nAs of December 31, 2021,\nthe Credit Agreement was undrawn and\nTeradyne was in compliance with all covenants under the Credit Agreement.\n76\nK.    ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income, which is presented net of tax, consist of the following:\nReclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) inco\nm\ne to the statements of op\ne\nrations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were as follows:\n77\nL.    GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nTeradyne performs its annual goodwill impairment test as required under the provisions of ASC 350-10, “\nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other,\n” on December 31 of each fiscal year unless interim indicators of impairment exist. Goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value.\nTeradyne has the option to perform a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If Teradyne determines this is the case, Teradyne is required to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test to identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment loss to be recognized. If Teradyne determines that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amounts, the quantitative goodwill impairment test is not required. In performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test, Teradyne determines the fair value of a reporting unit using the results derived from an income approach and a market approach, weighting the fair value determined under each approach to determine an estimated fair value for a reporting unit. The income approach is estimated through the discounted cash flows (“DCF”) analysis. Determining fair value requires the exercise of significant judgment, including judgments about appropriate discount rates, perpetual growth rates, and the amount and timing of expected future cash flows. Discount rates are based on a weighted average cost of capital (“WACC”), which represents the average rate a business must pay its providers of debt and equity, plus a risk premium. The WACC used to test goodwill is derived from a group of comparable companies. The cash flows employed in the DCF analysis are derived from internal forecasts and external market forecasts. The market approach estimates the fair value of the reporting unit by utilizing the market comparable method which is based on revenue and earnings multiples from comparable companies. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, then the goodwill is written down by the amount that carrying value exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, but not below zero.\nOn September 15, 2020, Teradyne announced the appointment of Gregory Smith as President of Teradyne’s Industrial Automation reportable segment effective October 1, 2020. With the appointment of Gregory Smith, the Industrial Automation reportable segment, which includes UR, MiR and AutoGuide, is considered one operating segment and one reporting unit. Teradyne performed a goodwill impairment test at the time of the change in operating segments, which indicated the fair value of Teradyne’s reporting units exceeded their carrying values.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, Teradyne performed the annual goodwill impairment test, completing a quantitative assessment for the Wireless Test, and System Test reporting units and qualitative assessment for the Industrial Automation reporting unit. There was\nno\nimpairment as a result of the annual test performed in the fourth quarter of 2021. Key assumptions in the goodwill valuation model are forecasted revenues, discount rate, earnings before interest and taxes, and revenue multiples from comparable companies. A change in any of these key assumptions could result in the reporting unit being impaired in a future period.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, Teradyne performed the annual goodwill impairment test, completing a qualitative assessment for the Wireless Test, System Test, and Industrial Automation reporting units. There was no impairment as a result of the annual test performed in the fourth quarter of 2020. Key assumptions in the goodwill valuation model are forecasted revenues, discount rate, earnings before interest and taxes, and revenue multiples from comparable companies. A change in any of these key assumptions could result in the reporting unit being impaired in a future period.\n78\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segments for the years ended D\ne\ncember 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nIntangible Assets\nTeradyne reviews long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate.\nThere were no events or circumstances indicating that the carrying value of intangible and long-lived assets may not be recoverable in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAmortizable intangible assets consist of the following and are included in intangible assets, net on the balance sheets:\n79\nAggregate intangible assets amortization expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n21.5\nmillion, $\n30.8\nmillion, and $\n40.1\nmillion, respectively.\nEstimated intangible assets amortization expense for each of the five succeeding fiscal years is as follows:\nM.    COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nPurchase Commitments\nAs of December 31, 2021, Teradyne had entered into non-cancelable purchase commitments for certain components and materials. The purchase commitments covered by the agreements aggregate to approximately $\n884.3\nmillion, of which $\n839.2\nmillion is for less than one year.\nLegal Claims\nTeradyne is subject to various legal proceedings and claims which have arisen in the ordinary course of business such as, but not limited to, patent, employment, commercial and environmental matters. Teradyne believes that it has meritorious defenses against all pending claims and intends to vigorously contest them. While it is not possible to predict or determine the outcomes of any pending claims or to provide possible ranges of losses that may arise, Teradyne believes the potential losses associated with all of these actions are unlikely to have a material adverse effect on its business, financial position or results of operations.\nOn March 8, 2021, Industrial Automation LLC submitted a demand for arbitration against Teradyne and AutoGuide in Wilmington, Delaware alleging that Teradyne and AutoGuide breached certain provisions of the Membership Interests Purchase Agreement (the “Purchase Agreement”), dated as of October 18, 2019, among Industrial Automation LLC, Teradyne and AutoGuide. The arbitration demand seeks full acceleration of the maximum earnout amount payable under the Purchase Agreement, or $\n106.9\nmillion,\nfor the alleged breach of the earnout provisions of the Purchase Agreement. On March 26, 2021, Teradyne and AutoGuide filed an answer denying that Teradyne and AutoGuide breached any provisions of the Purchase Agreement. The arbitration hearing is scheduled for March 21, 2022. While it is not possible at this stage to predict the outcome of the arbitration,\na material loss is reasonably possible, but not estimab\nle.\nTeradyn\ne and AutoGuide intend to vigorously defend against the Industrial Automation LLC claims. The ultimate amount of contingent consideration for the earn-outs in connection with the acquisition of AutoGuide may be affected by the outcome of the arbitration.\n80\nGuarantees and Indemnification Obligations\nTeradyne provides indemnification, to the extent permitted by law, to its officers, directors, employees and agents for liabilities arising from certain events or occurrences, while the officer, director, employee, or agent, is or was serving, at Teradyne’s request in such capacity. Teradyne may enter into indemnification agreements with certain of its officers and directors. With respect to acquisitions, Teradyne provides indemnifications to or assumes indemnification obligations for the current and former directors, officers and employees of the acquired companies in accordance with the acquired companies’ by-laws and charter. As a matter of practice, Teradyne has maintained directors’ and officers’ liability insurance coverage including coverage for directors and officers of acquired companies.\nTeradyne enters into agreements in the ordinary course of business with customers, resellers, distributors, integrators and suppliers. Most of these agreements require Teradyne to defend and/or indemnify the other party against intellectual property infringement claims brought by a third party with respect to Teradyne’s products. From time to time, Teradyne also indemnifies customers and business partners for damages, losses and liabilities they may suffer or incur relating to personal injury, personal property damage, product liability, breach of confidentiality obligations and environmental claims relating to the use of Teradyne’s products and services or resulting from the acts or omissions of Teradyne, its employees, authorized agents or subcontractors. On occasion, Teradyne has also provided guarantees to customers regarding the delivery and performance of its products in addition to the warranty described below.\nAs a matter of ordinary course of business, Teradyne warrants that its products will substantially perform in accordance with its standard published specifications in effect at the time of delivery. Most warranties have a one-year duration commencing from installation. A provision is recorded upon revenue recognition to cost of revenues for estimated warranty expense based upon historical experience. When Teradyne receives revenue for extended warranties beyond the standard duration, the revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the contract period. Related costs are expensed as incurred. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, Teradyne had a product warranty accrual of $\n24.6\nmillion and $\n16.6\nmillion, respectively, included in other accrued liabilities, and revenue deferrals related to extended warranties of $\n64.2\nmillion and $\n51.9\nmillion, respectively, included in short and long-term deferred revenue and customer advances.\nIn addition, in the ordinary course of business, Teradyne provides minimum purchase guarantees to certain vendors to ensure continuity of supply against the market demand. Although some of these guarantees provide penalties for cancellations and/or modifications to the purchase commitments as the market demand decreases, most of the guarantees do not. Therefore, as the market demand decreases, Teradyne re-evaluates these guarantees and determines what charges, if any, should be recorded.\nWith respect to its agreements covering product, business or entity divestitures and acquisitions, Teradyne provides certain representations, warranties and covenants to purchasers and agrees to indemnify and hold such purchasers harmless against breaches of such representations, warranties and covenants. Many of the indemnification claims have a definite expiration date while some remain in force indefinitely. With respect to its acquisitions, Teradyne may, from time to time, assume the liability for certain events or occurrences that took place prior to the date of acquisition.\nAs a matter of ordinary course of business, Teradyne occasionally guarantees certain indebtedness obligations of its subsidiary companies, limited to the borrowings from financial institutions, purchase commitments to certain vendors, and lease commitments to landlords.\nBased on historical experience and information known as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, except for product warranty, Teradyne has not recorded any liabilities for these guarantees and obligations because the amount would be immaterial.\n81\nN.    NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted net income per common share:\nThe computation of diluted net income per common share for 2021 and 2020 excludes the effect of the potential exercise of stock options to purchase approximately\n0.1\nmillion shares and restricted stock units to purchase approximately\n0.1\nmillion shares because the effect would have been anti-dilutive.\nO.    RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, Teradyne recorded $\n1.5\nmillion of severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, $\n0.5\nmillion of acquisition related compensation and expenses and $\n14.5\nm\nillion for other expenses, offset by a $\n7.2\nmillion gain for the decrease in the fair value of the AutoGuide contingent consideration liability.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, Teradyne recorded a $\n19.7\nmillion gain for the decrease in the fair value of the AutoGuide contingent consideration liability, and a $\n3.5\nmillion gain for the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by a\n$\n4.0\nmillion contract termination settlement charge, $\n2.5\nmillion of acquisition related compensation and expenses, $\n2.3\nmillion of severance charges primarily in Industrial Automation, and $\n1.2\nmillion of other expenses.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, Teradyne recorded a gain of $\n22.2\nmillion from the decrease in the fair value of the MiR contingent consideration liability, partially offset by a $\n3.0\nmillion increase in the fair value of the AutoGuide contingent consideration, $\n2.9\nmillion of severance charges related to headcount reductions primarily in Semiconductor Test and Industrial Automation, and $\n2.5\nmillion for acquisition related expenses and compensation\n82\nP.    RETIREMENT PLANS\nASC 715\n,\n“\nCompensation—Retirement Benefits,\n” requires an employer with defined benefit plans or other postretirement benefit plans to recognize an asset or a liability on its balance sheet for the overfunded or underfunded status of the plans as defined by ASC 715. The pension asset or liability represents a difference between the fair value of the pension plan’s assets and the projected benefit obligation at December 31. Teradyne uses a December 31 measurement date for all of its plans.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nTeradyne has defined benefit pension plans covering a portion of domestic employees and employees of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries. Benefits under these plans are based on employees’ years of service and compensation. Teradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. The assets of these plans consist primarily of fixed income and equity securities. In addition, Teradyne has an unfunded supplemental executive defined benefit plan in the United States to provide retirement benefits in excess of levels allowed by the Employment Retirement Income Security Act (“ERISA”) and the Internal Revenue Code (the “IRC”), as well as unfunded qualified foreign plans.\nIn 2021, Teradyne’s projected benefit obligations decreased primarily due to actuarial gains of approximately $\n8.7\nmillion across all pension plans from increases in discount rates, and approximately $\n3.3\nmillion gain from foreign exchange effects for\nforeign plans.\nIn 2020, Teradyne’s projected benefit obligations increased primarily due to actuarial losses of approximately $\n27.6\nmillion across all pension plans from decreases in discount rates, and approximately $\n4.0\nmillion from unfavorable foreign exchange effects for the German plan, partially offset by a transfer of obligations for approximately\n115\nretiree participants to an insurance company which resulted in a $\n24.4\nmillion reduction in the projected benefit obligations and pension assets. We also recorded a settlement loss of $\n0.5\nmillion related to the retiree group annuity transaction.\nThe December 31 balances of these defined benefit pension plans assets and obligations are shown below:\n83\nThe following table provides amounts recorded within the account line items of the statements of financial position as of December 31:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the United States defined benefit pension plans was $\n187.5\nmillion and $\n196.7\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for foreign defined benefit pension plans was $\n42.5\nmillion and $\n46.5\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInformation for pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets as of December 31:\nExpense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Teradyne’s net periodic pension cost (income) was comprised of the following:\nWeighted Average Assumptions to Determine Net Periodic Pension Cost at January 1:\n84\nWeighted Average Assumptions to Determine Pension Obligations at December 31:\nIn developing the expected return on plan assets assumption, Teradyne evaluates input from its investment manager and pension consultants, including their forecast of asset class return expectations. Teradyne believes that\n2.4\n% was an appropriate rate to use for fiscal year 2021 for the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan (“U.S. Plan”).\nTeradyne recognizes net actuarial gains and losses and the change in the fair value of the plan assets in its operating results in the year in which they occur or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans. Teradyne calculates the expected return on plan assets using the fair value of the plan assets. Actuarial gains and losses are generally measured annually as of December 31 and, accordingly, recorded during the fourth quarter of each year or upon any interim remeasurement of the plans.\nThe discount rate utilized to determine future pension obligations for the U.S. Plan is based on FTSE Pension Index adjusted for the plan’s expected cash flows and was\n2.65\n% at December 31, 2021, up from\n2.3\n% at December 31, 2020.\nPlan Assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, the fair value of Teradyne’s pension plans’ assets totaled $\n151.6\nmillion, of which $\n149.6\nmillion was related to the U.S. Plan and $\n2.0\nmillion was related to the Taiwan defined benefit pension plan. Substantially all of Teradyne’s pension plans’ assets are held in individual trusts, which were established for the investment of assets of Teradyne’s sponsored retirement plans.\nThe following table provides weighted average pension asset allocation by asset category at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe assets of the U.S. Plan are overseen by the Teradyne Fiduciary Committee which is comprised of members of senior management drawn from appropriate diversified levels of the management team. The Fiduciary Committee is responsible for setting the policy that provides the framework for management of the U.S. Plan assets. In accordance with its responsibilities, the Fiduciary Committee meets on a regular basis to review the performance of the U.S. Plan assets and compliance with the investment policy. The policy sets forth an investment structure for managing U.S. Plan assets, including setting the asset allocation ranges, which are expected to provide an appropriate level of overall diversification required to maximize the long-term return on plan assets for a prudent and reasonable level of risk given prevailing market conditions, total investment return over the long term, and preservation of capital, while maintaining sufficient liquidity to pay the benefits of the U.S. Plan. The investment portfolio will not, at any time, have a direct investment in Teradyne stock. It may have indirect investment in Teradyne stock, if one of the funds selected by the investment manager invests in Teradyne stock. In developing the asset allocation ranges, third party asset allocation studies are periodically performed that consider the current and expected positions of the plan assets and funded status. Based on this\n85\nstudy and other appropriate information, the Fiduciary Committee establishes asset allocation ranges taking into account acceptable risk targets and associated returns. The investment return objectives are to avoid excessive volatility and produce a rate of return that at least matches the Policy Index identified below. The manager’s investment performance is reviewed at least annually. Results for the total portfolio and for each major category of assets are evaluated in comparison with appropriate market indices and the Policy Index.\nThe target asset allocation and the index for each asset category for the U.S. Plan, per the investment policy, are as follows:\nTeradyne’s U.S. Plan invests primarily in common trust funds. Units held in the common trust funds are valued at the unit price as reported by the investment manager based on the asset value of the underlying investments; underlying investments in equity securities are valued at the last reported sales price, and underlying investments in fixed-income securities are generally valued using methods based upon market transactions for comparable securities.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no transfers of pension assets in or out of Level 1, Level 2, and Level 3.\nThe fair value of pension plan assets by asset category and by level at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n86\nContributions\nTeradyne’s funding policy is to make contributions to the plans in accordance with local laws and to the extent that such contributions are tax deductible. During 2021, Teradyne contributed $\n3.3\nmillion to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $\n1.0\nmillion to certain qualified plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries. During 2020, Teradyne contributed $\n3.1\nmillion to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and $\n1.1\nmillion to certain qualified plans for non-U.S. subsidiaries. In 2022, contributions to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and certain qualified plans from non-U.S. subsidiaries will be approximately $\n3.3\nmillion and $\n1.0\nmillion, respectively.\nContributions to the U.S. supplemental executive defined benefit pension plan and certain non-U.S. subsidiaries qualified plans will be approximately $\n6.7\nmillion and $\n2.5\nmillion, respectively, in 1 to 3 years, $\n7.2\nmillion and $\n2.3\nmillion, respectively, in 3 to 5 years and $\n18.3\nmillion and $\n6.9\nmillion, respectively, thereafter\n.\nExpected Future Pension Benefit Payments\nFuture benefit payments are expected to be paid as follows:\nPostretirement Benefit Plans\nIn addition to receiving pension benefits, U.S. Teradyne employees who meet early retirement eligibility requirements as of their termination dates may participate in Teradyne’s Welfare Plan, which includes medical and dental benefits up to age 65. Death benefits provide a fixed sum to retirees’ survivors and are available to all retirees. Substantially all of Teradyne’s current U.S. employees could become eligible for these benefits, and the existing benefit obligation relates primarily to those employees.\nThe December 31 balances of the postretirement assets and obligations are shown below:\n87\nThe following table provides amounts recorded within the account line items of financial position as of December 31:\nThe following table provides amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31:\nExpense\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Teradyne’s net periodic postretirement benefit (income) cost was comprised of the following:\nWeighted Average Assumptions to Determine Net Periodic Postretirement Benefit Income as of January 1:\n88\nWeighted Average Assumptions to Determine Postretirement Benefit Obligation as of December 31:\nContributions\nContributions to the U.S. postretirement benefit plan will be approximately $\n0.9\nmillion in 2022, $\n1.4\nmillion in 1 to 3 years, $\n0.9\nmillion in 3 to 5 years and $\n1.4\nmillion, thereafter.\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\nFuture benefit payments are expected to be paid as follows:\nQ.    STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock Compensation Plans\nUnder Teradyne’s stock compensation plans, Teradyne grants time-based restricted stock units, performance-based restricted stock units, stock options and employees are eligible to purchase Teradyne’s common stock through its Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”).\nService-based restricted stock unit awards granted to employees vest in equal annual installments over\nfour years\n. Restricted stock unit awards granted to non-employee directors vest after a\none\n-year\nperiod, with\n100\n% of the award vesting on the earlier of (a) the first anniversary of the grant date or (b) the date of the following year’s Annual Meeting of Shareholders. Teradyne expenses the cost of the restricted stock unit awards subject to time-based vesting, which is determined to be the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant, ratably over the period during which the restrictions lapse.\nPerformance-based restricted stock units (“PRSUs”) granted to Teradyne’s executive officers may have a performance metric based on relative total shareholder return (“TSR”). Teradyne’s\nthree-year\nTSR performance is measured against the New York Stock Exchange (“NYSE”) Composite Index. The final number of TSR PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target shares. The TSR PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date. The TSR PRSUs are valued using a Monte Carlo simulation model. The number of units expected to be earned, based upon the achievement of the TSR market condition, is factored into the grant date Monte Carlo valuation. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three-year service period or the period from the grant to the date described in the retirement provisions below. Compensation expense for executive officers meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date is recognized during the year following the grant. Compensation expense is recognized regardless of the eventual number of units that are earned based upon the market condition, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period. Compensation expense is reversed if at any time during the three-year service period the executive officer is no longer an employee, subject to the retirement and termination eligibility provisions noted below.\n89\nPRSUs granted to Teradyne’s executive officers may also have a performance metric based on\nthree-year\ncumulative non-GAAP profit before interest and tax (“PBIT”) as a percent of Teradyne’s revenue. Non-GAAP PBIT is a financial measure equal to GAAP\nincome\nfrom operations less restructuring and other, net; amortization of acquired intangible assets; acquisition and divestiture related charges or credits; pension actuarial gains and losses; non-cash convertible debt interest expense; and other non-recurring gains and charges. The final number of PBIT PRSUs that vest will vary based upon the level of performance achieved from\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the target shares. The PBIT PRSUs will vest upon the three-year anniversary of the grant date. Compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the three-year service period or the period from the grant date to the date described in the retirement provisions below. Compensation expense for executive officers meeting the retirement provisions prior to the grant date is recognized during the year following the\ngrant. Compensation expense is recognized based on the number of units that are earned based upon the three-year Teradyne PBIT as a percent of Teradyne’s revenue, provided the executive officer remains an employee at the end of the three-year period subject to the retirement and\ntermination\neligibility provisions noted below.\nIf a PRSU recipient’s employment ends prior to the determination of the performance percentage due to (1) permanent disability or death or (2) retirement or termination other than for cause, after attaining both at least age\nsixty\nand at least\nten years\nof service, then all or a portion of the recipient’s PRSUs (based on the actual performance percentage achieved on the determination date) will vest on the date the performance percentage is determined. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence, no PRSUs will vest if the executive officer is no longer an employee at the end of the\nthree-year\nperiod. Stock options to purchase Teradyne’s common stock at\n100\n% of the fair market value on the grant date vest in equal annual installments over\nfour years\nfrom the grant date and have a maximum term of\nseven years\n.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne granted\n0.3\nmillion,\n0.4\nmillion and\n0.8\nmillion of service-based restricted stock unit awards to employees at a weighted average grant date fair value of $\n114.16\n, $\n71.31\n, and $\n37.65\n, respectively.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne granted\n0.1\nmillion of service-based restricted stock unit awards to non-employee directors at a weighted average grant date fair value of $\n128.70\n, $\n66.56\n, and $\n48.03\n, respectively.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne granted\n0.1\nmillion of PBIT PRSUs with a grant date fair value of $\n113.65\n, $\n70.94\nand $\n36.88\n, respectively.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne granted\n0.1\nmillion TSR PRSUs, with a grant date fair value of $\n125.02\n, $\n89.93\n, and $\n51.51\n, respectively.\nThe fair value was estimated using the Monte Carlo simulation model with the following assumptions:\nExpected volatility was based on the historical volatility of Teradyne’s stock and the NYSE Composite Index for each of the 2021, 2020 and 2019 grants over the most recent three-year period. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of each of the grants. Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $\n0.40\nper share for 2021, $\n0.40\nper share for 2020 and $\n0.36\nper share for 2019, divided by Teradyne’s stock price on the grant date of $\n113.48\nfor the 2021 grants, $\n72.10\nfor the 2020 grants and $\n37.95\nfor the 2019 grants.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne granted\n0.1\nmillion of service-based stock options to executive officers at a weighted average grant date fair value of $\n36.60\n, $\n20.93\n, and $\n10.64\n, respectively.\n90\nThe fair value of stock options was estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nTeradyne determined the stock options’ expected life based upon historical exercise data for executive officers, the age of the executive officers and the terms of the stock option grant. Volatility was determined using historical volatility for a period equal to the expected life. The risk-free interest rate was determined using the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Dividend yield was based upon an estimated annual dividend amount of $\n0.40\nper share divided by Teradyne’s stock price on the grant date of $\n113.48\nfor the 2021 grants, $\n72.61\nfor the 2020 grants and $\n37.95\nfor the 2019 grants.\nStock compensation plan activity for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, is as follows:\nTotal shares available for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n91\nWeighted average restricted stock unit award date fair value information for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, is as follows:\nRestricted stock unit awards aggregate intrinsic value information at December 31 for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nRestricted stock units weighted average remaining contractual terms (in years) information at December 31 for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nWeighted average stock options exercise price information for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nThe total cash received from employees as a result of employee stock options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n3.1\nmillion, $\n3.8\nmillion, and $\n3.7\nmillion, respectively. In connection with these exercises, the tax benefit realized by Teradyne for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, was $\n0.4\nmillion, $\n1.5\nmillion, and $\n2.0\nmillion, respectively.\nStock option aggregate intrinsic value information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n92\nStock options weighted average remaining contractual terms (in years) information at December 31, for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, total unrecognized expense related to non-vested restricted stock unit awards and stock options was $\n50.6\nmillion and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.4\nyears.\nIn 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne recognized a discrete tax benefit of $\n14.7\nmillion, $\n9.6\nmillion and $\n4.9\nmillion, respectively, related to net excess tax benefit.\nOn July 17, 2019 (the “Retirement Date”), former Chief Financial Officer Gregory Beecher retired as Vice President and Senior Advisor of Teradyne, and Teradyne entered into an agreement (the “Retirement Agreement”) with Mr. Beecher. Under the Retirement Agreement, Mr. Beecher’s unvested time-based restricted stock units and stock options granted prior to 2019 were modified to allow continued vesting; unvested time-based restricted stock units and stock options granted in 2019 were modified to allow continued vesting through January 31, 2023 (the\n“Non-Competition\nPeriod”) in a\npro-rated\namount based on the number of days that Mr. Beecher was employed during 2019; unvested, performance-based restricted stock units awarded in 2019 will vest on the date the amount of shares underlying the performance-based restricted stock units are determined in a\npro-rated\namount of shares based on the number of days that Mr. Beecher was empl\no\nyed during 2019; vested options or options that vest during the\nNon-Competition\nPeriod may be exercised for the remainder of the applicable option ter\nm. During 2019, Teradyne recorded a stock-based compensation expense of $\n2.1\nmillion related to the Retirement Agreement.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the ESPP, eligible employees may purchase shares of common stock through regular payroll deductions of up to\n10\n% of their compensation, to a maximum of shares with a fair market value of $\n25,000\nper calendar year, not to exceed\n6,000\nshares. Under the plan, the price paid for the common stock is equal to\n85\n% of the stock price on the last business day of the six-month purchase period.\nIn July 2021,\n0.1\nmillion shares of common stock were issued to employees who participated in the plan during the first half of 2021 at the price of $\n113.87\nper share. In January 2022, Teradyne issued\n0.1\nmillion shares of common stock to employees who participated in the plan during the second half of 2021 at the price of $\n139.00\nper share.\nIn July 2020,\n0.2\nmillion shares of common stock were issued to employees who participated in the plan during the first half of 2020 at the price of $\n71.83\nper share. In January 2021, Teradyne issued\n0.1\nmillion shares of common stock to employees who participated in the plan during the second half of 2020 at the price of $\n101.91\nper share.\nIn July 2019,\n0.3\nmillion shares of common stock were issued to employees who participated in the plan during the first half of 2019 at the price of $\n40.72\nper share. In January 2020, Teradyne issued\n0.2\nmillion shares of common stock to employees who participated in the plan during the second half of 2019 at the price of $\n57.96\nper share.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were\n4.2\nmillion shares available for grant under the ESPP.\n93\nThe following table provides the effect to income from operations for recording stock-based compensation for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nR.    SAVINGS PLAN\nTeradyne sponsors a defined contribution employee retirement savings plan (“Savings Plan”) covering substantially all U.S. employees. Under the Savings Plan, employees may contribute up to\n20\n% of their compensation (subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations). The Savings Plan provides for a discretionary employer match that is determined each year. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, Teradyne matched\n100\n% of eligible employee contributions up to\n4\n% of their compensation for employees not accruing benefits in the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. There was no match for employees still actively accruing benefits in the U.S. Qualified Pension Plan. Teradyne’s contributions vest\n25\n% per year for the first four years of employment, and contributions for those employees with\nfour years\nof service vest immediately.\nIn addition, Teradyne sponsors an unfunded U.S. Supplemental Savings Plan to provide savings benefits in excess of those allowed by the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and the Internal Revenue Code. The provisions of this plan are the same as the Savings Plan. The liability for the U.S. Supplemental Savings Plan at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was $\n47.2\nmillion and $\n38.0\nmillion, respectively, and is included in retirement plan liabilities. Teradyne contributes to defined contributions savings plans for its foreign employees. Under Teradyne’s savings plans, amounts charged to the statements of operations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $\n26.9\nmillion, $\n21.7\nmillion, and $\n20.9\nmillion,\nrespectively.\n94\nS.    INCOME TAXES\nThe components of income before income taxes and the provision (benefit) for income taxes as shown in the consolidated statements of operations were as follows:\nIncome tax\nexpense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $\n146.4\nmillion, $\n116.9\nmillion, and $\n58.3\nmillion, respectively. The effective tax rate for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was\n12.6\n%,\n13.0\n% and\n11.1\n%, respectively.\nOn December 22, 2017, the U.S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Tax Reform Act”), making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. The Tax Reform Act has significant direct and indirect implications for accounting for income taxes under ASC 740, “Accounting for Income Taxes” some of which could not be calculated with precision until further clarification and guidance was made available from tax authorities, regulatory bodies or the FASB. In light of this uncertainty, on December 22, 2017 the SEC issued Staff Accounting Bulletin (“SAB”) No. 118, “Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act,” to address uncertainty in the application of U.S. GAAP when the registrant does not have the necessary information available, prepared, or analyzed (including computations) in reasonable detail to complete the accounting for certain income tax effects of the Tax Reform Act. In accordance with SAB 118, Teradyne recorded $\n186.0\nmillion of additional income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2017 which represented Teradyne’s best estimate of the impact of the Tax Reform Act in accordance with Teradyne’s understanding of the Tax Reform Act and available guidance as of that date. The $\n186.0\nmillion was primarily composed of expense of $\n161.0\nmillion related to the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings, $\n33.6\nmillion of expense related to the remeasurement of certain deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the rates at which they are expected to reverse in the future, and a benefit of $\n10.3\nmillion associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions. In accordance with the requirements of SAB 118, in the fourth quarter of 2018, Teradyne completed its analysis of the effect of the Tax Reform Act based on the application of the most recently available guidance as of December 31, 2018 and\nrecorded $\n49.5\nmillion of net income tax benefit. The net benefit consisted of $\n51.7\nmillion of benefit resulting from a reduction in the estimate of the one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and an expense of $\n2.2\nmillion associated with the impact of correlative adjustments on uncertain tax positions. Teradyne will pay approximately $\n7.9\nmillion related to the transition tax in 2022, $\n22.7\nmillion in 1 to 3 years, and $\n44.3\nmillion in 3 to 5\nyears.\n95\nTeradyne has\nmade an accounting policy election to account for global intangible\nlow-taxed\nincome (“GILTI”) as a component of tax expense in the period in which Teradyne is subject to the rules and therefore did not provide any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in its consolidated financial statements.\nOn July 27, 2015, in Altera Corp. (“Altera”) v. Commissioner, the U.S. Tax Court issued an opinion invalidating the regulations relating to the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in an intercompany cost-sharing arrangement. A final decision was issued by the Tax Court in December 2015. The IRS appealed the decision in June 2016. On July 24, 2018, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”) issued a decision that was subsequently withdrawn and a reconstituted panel conferred on the appeal. On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit upheld the cost-sharing regulations. On November 12, 2019 the Ninth Circuit denied Altera’s petition for rehearing of its case. Altera’s application for certiorari to the Supreme Court was declined on June 22, 2020. In the fourth quarter of 2020 and 2021, Teradyne recognized approximately $\n2.3\nmillion of tax expense and $\n2.5\nmillion of tax benefit in 2020 and 2021, respectively, related to the inclusion of stock-based compensation in its intercompany cost-sharing arrangement.\nThe decrease in the effective tax rate from 2020 to 2021 is primarily attributable to a decrease in the expense from U.S. global\nlow-taxed\nincome partially offset by a decrease in the benefit from foreign tax credits and a shift in the geographic distribution of income, which increased the income subject to taxation in higher tax rate jurisdictions relative to lower tax rate jurisdictions.\nThe increase in the effective tax rate from 2019 to 2020 is primarily attributable to a reduction in the benefit from releases of reserves for uncertain tax positions, a reduction in benefit from foreign tax credits and an increase in the expense from U.S. global\nlow-taxed\nincome. These increases in expense were partially offset by a decrease in the transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign earnings and shift in the geographic distribution of income, which increases the income subject to taxation in lower tax rate jurisdictions relative to higher tax rate jurisdictions.\nA reconciliation\nof the effective tax rate for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n96\nTeradyne\nqualifies for a tax holiday in Singapore by fulfilling the requirements of an agreement with the Singapore Economic Development Board under which certain headcount and spending requirements must be met. The tax savings attributable to the Singapore tax holiday for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n33.3\nmillion or $\n0.18\nper diluted share, $\n29.9\nmillion or $\n0.16\nper diluted share and $\n15.1\nmillion or $\n0.08\nper diluted share, respectively. In November 2020, Teradyne entered into an agreement with the Singapore\nEconomic Development Board which extended our Singapore tax holiday under substantially similar terms to the agreement which expired on December 31, 2020. The new tax holiday is scheduled to expire on\nDecember 31, 2025\n.\nSignificant components of Teradyne’s deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2021 and\n2020\nwere as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, Teradyne evaluated the likelihood that it would realize deferred income taxes to offset future taxable income and concluded that it is more likely than not that a substantial majority of its deferred tax assets will be realized through consideration of both the positive and negative evidence. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, Teradyne maintained a valuation allowance for certain deferred tax assets of $\n97\n.0\nmillion and $\n85\n.0 million, respectively, primarily related to state net operating losses and state tax credit carryforwards, due to the uncertainty regarding their realization. Adjustments could be required in the future if Teradyne estimates that the amount of deferred tax assets to be realized is more or less than the net amount\nrecorded.\n97\nAt December\n31, 2021, Teradyne had tax effected operating loss carryforwards that expire in the following years:\nTeradyne has approximately $\n128.9\nmillion of tax credit carryforwards including federal business tax credits of approximately $\n1.9\nmillion which expire in\n2028\nthrough 2031, and state tax credits of $\n127.1\nmillion, of which $\n68.7\nmillion do not expire and the remainder expires in the years\n2022\nthrough\n2041\n.\nTeradyne’s gross unrecognize\nd\ntax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nCurrent year additions relate to federal and state research credits. Prior year additions relate to state research credits. Prior year reductions are composed of federal reserves related to transfer pricing and research credits which resulted from the expiration of statute for 2017 U.S. federal tax return in the fourth quarter of 2021 and state research credits.\nOf the $\n14.5\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021, $\n9.5\nmillion would impact the consolidated income tax rate if ultimately recognized. The remaining $\n4.9\nmillion would impact deferred taxes if recognized.\nAs of December\n31, 2021, Teradyne estimates that it is reasonably possible that the balance of unrecognized tax benefits may decrease approximately $\n3.0\nmillion in the next twelve months as a result of a lapse of statutes of limitation. The estimated decrease relates to loss carryforwards, research credits and U.S. manufacturing activities deductions.\nTeradyne records all interest and penalties related to income taxes as a component of income tax expense. Accrued interest and penalties related to income tax items at December 31, 2021 and 2020 amounted to\n98\n$\n0.3\nmillion and $\n1.2\nmillion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, benefit of $\n0.9\nmillion, expense of $\n0.2\nmillion and benefit of $\n1.1\nmillion, respectively, was recorded for interest and penalties related to income tax items.\nTeradyne is subject to U.S. federal income tax, as well as income tax in multiple state, local and foreign jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, all material state and local income tax matters have been concluded through 2016, all material federal income tax matters have been concluded through 2017 and all material foreign income tax matters have been concluded through 2013. However, in some jurisdictions, including the United States, operating losses and tax credits may be subject to adjustment until such time as they are utilized and the year of utilization is closed to adjustment.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Teradyne is not permanently reinvested with respect to the unremitted earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries to the extent that those earnings exceed local statutory and operational requirements. Remittance of those earnings is not expected to result in material income tax.\nT.    OPERATING SEGMENT, GEOGRAPHIC AND SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER INFORMATION\nTeradyne has\nfour\nreportable segments (Semiconductor Test, System Test, Wireless Test and Industrial Automation). Each of the reportable segment represents an individual operating segment. On September 15, 2020, Teradyne announced the appointment of Gregory Smith as President of Teradyne’s Industrial Automation reportable segment effective October 1, 2020. With the appointment of Gregory Smith, the Industrial Automation reportable segment is considered one operating segment and one reporting unit. The Semiconductor Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of semiconductor test products and services. The System Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of products and services for storage and system level test, defense/aerospace instrumentation test, and circuit-board test. The Wireless Test segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of wireless test products and services. The Industrial Automation segment includes operations related to the design, manufacturing and marketing of collaborative robotic arms, autonomous mobile robots and advanced robotic control software.\nTeradyne evaluates performance based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is business segment income (loss) before income taxes. The accounting policies of the business segments are the same as those described in Note B: “Accounting Policies.”\n99\nSegment information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n100\nIncluded in each segment are charges and credits in the following line items in the statements of operations:\nInformation as to Teradyne’s revenues by country is as follows:\nIn 2021 and 2020, revenues from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd., a customer of Teradyne’s Semiconductor Test segment, accounted for\n12\n% and\n15\n%, respectively, of Teradyne’s consolidated revenues.
