As of January 2, 2022, we employed approximately 6,500 sales and service representatives operating in approximately 40 countries and marketing products and services in more than 190 countries. In geographic regions where we do not have a sales and service presence, we utilize distributors to sell our products.\nRaw Materials, Key Components and Supplies\nEach of our businesses uses a wide variety of raw materials, key components and supplies that are generally available from alternate sources of supply and in adequate quantities from domestic and foreign sources. We generally have multi-year contracts, with no minimum purchase requirements, with our suppliers. For certain critical raw materials, key components and supplies required for the production of some of our principal products, we have qualified only a limited or a single source of supply. We periodically purchase quantities of some of these critical raw materials in excess of current requirements, in anticipation of future manufacturing needs. With sufficient lead times, we believe we would be able to qualify alternative suppliers for each of these raw materials and key components. See the applicable risk factor in “Item 1A. Risk Factors” for an additional description of this risk.\nIntellectual Property\nWe own numerous United States and foreign patents and have patent applications pending in the United States and abroad. We also license intellectual property rights to and from third parties, some of which bear royalties and are terminable in specified circumstances. In addition to our patent portfolio, we possess a wide array of unpatented proprietary technology and know-how. We also own numerous United States and foreign trademarks and trade names for a variety of our product names, and have applications for the registration of trademarks and trade names pending in the United States and abroad. We believe that patents and other proprietary rights are important to the development of both of our reporting segments, but we also rely upon trade secrets, know-how, continuing technological innovations and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain the competitive position of both of our reporting segments. We do not believe that the loss of any one patent or other proprietary right would have a material adverse effect on our overall business or on any of our reporting segments.\nIn some cases, we may participate in litigation or other proceedings to defend against or assert claims of infringement, to enforce our patents or our licensors’ patents, to protect our trade secrets, know-how or other intellectual property rights, or to determine the scope and validity of our or third parties’ intellectual property rights. Litigation of this type could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources. An adverse outcome in any litigation or proceeding could subject us to significant liabilities or expenses, require us to cease using disputed intellectual property or cease the sale of a product, or require us to license the disputed intellectual property from third parties.\nCompetition\nDue to the range and diversity of our products and services, we face many different types of competition and competitors. Our competitors range from foreign and domestic organizations, which produce a comprehensive array of goods and services and that may have greater financial and other resources than we do, to more narrowly focused firms producing a limited number of goods or services for specialized market segments.\nWe compete on the basis of service level, price, technological innovation, operational efficiency, product differentiation, product availability, quality and reliability. Competitors range from multinational organizations with a wide range of products to specialized firms that in some cases have well-established market positions. We expect the proportion of large competitors to increase through the continued consolidation of competitors.\nRegulatory Affairs\nOur operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of our product activities, and if we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may face, among other things, warning letters; adverse publicity; investigations or notices of non-compliance, fines, injunctions, and civil penalties; import or export restrictions; partial suspensions or total shutdown of production facilities or the imposition of operating restrictions;\n11\nincreased difficulty in obtaining required FDA clearances or approvals or foreign equivalents; seizures or recalls of our products or those of our customers; or the inability to sell our products.\nWe have agreements relating to the sale of our products and services to government entities and, as a result, we are subject to various statutes and regulations that apply to companies doing business with the government. We are also subject to investigation for compliance with the regulations governing government contracts. A failure to comply with these regulations could result in suspension of these contracts, as well as other penalties.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. In addition, changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses. The healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards.\nIf we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nEnvironmental Matters\nOur operations are subject to various foreign, federal, state and local environmental and safety laws and regulations. These requirements include the handling, transportation, manufacture and disposal of toxic or hazardous substances, the remediation of contaminated soil and groundwater, the regulation of radioactive materials, and the health and safety of our employees.\nWe may have liability under the Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act and comparable state statutes that impose liability for investigation and remediation of contamination without regard to fault, in connection with materials that we or our former businesses sent to various third-party sites. We have incurred, and expect to incur, costs pursuant to these statutes.\nWe are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations and, along with other companies, have been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. We accrue for environmental issues in the accounting period that our responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. We have accrued $11.9 million and $12.9 million as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively, which represents our management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. Our environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where we have been named a PRP, our management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. We expect that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to ten years. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.\nWe may become subject to new or unforeseen environmental costs or liabilities. Compliance with new or more stringent laws or regulations, stricter interpretations of existing laws, or the discovery of new contamination could cause us to incur additional costs.\nHuman Capital Management\nAs of January 2, 2022, we employed approximately 16,700 employees on a worldwide basis. Roughly\n75% o\nf our workforce is based outside of the United States. Employees at several of our subsidiaries outside the United States belong to labor unions and/or workers' councils in those jurisdictions. During fiscal year 2021, our voluntary turnover rate was roughly 10%. We believe that management of our human capital resources is vital to the continued growth and success of the Company,\n12\nand we endeavor to create an environment that encourages productivity, rewards performance and values diversity. There are several ways in which we attempt to attract, develop and retain highly qualified employees, as set forth below.\nOur human capital objectives include, as applicable, identifying, recruiting, developing, retaining, incentivizing, and integrating our existing and new employees. We strive to meet this objective by offering competitive compensation and benefits, in a diverse, inclusive and safe workplace, with opportunities for our employees to grow and develop in their careers. We hold our employees to high performance standards and our compensation plans are designed to deliver competitive base pay and attractive incentive opportunities. Our benefits programs are specifically tailored to the various countries in which we operate and maintain a significant workforce. We benchmark for market practices and adjust our compensation and benefits programs to ensure they remain both equitable and competitive.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe in an inclusive workforce, where employees from a number of cultures and countries are engaged and encouraged to leverage their collective talents. We have employees in more than 40 countries around the world.  As of the date of filing of this annual report on Form 10-K, women comprised roughly 30% of our leadership positions on a global basis, which we define as director level and above. We provided further information regarding our diversity demographics in our Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) Report and elsewhere on our website at www.perkinelmer.com, including from our consolidated EEO-1 report. An EEO-1 report is filed with the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and describes the racial, ethnic and gender composition of our U.S.-based workforce. Information on our website, including the CSR Report and the consolidated EEO-1 report, shall not be deemed incorporated by reference into this annual report.\nWe understand that our ability to operate in a multicultural world is critical to our long-term value creation. By maintaining a culture of diversity and inclusion, we believe we can innovate more effectively. To that end, we seek to promote diverse perspectives throughout our organization and are an equal opportunity employer committed to making employment decisions without regard to race, religion, national or ethnic origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity or expression, age, disability, protected veteran status or other characteristics protected by law.\nOur commitment to diversity is evidenced by the establishment in 2020 of our internal Inclusion and Diversity Committee, which is comprised of a wide cross-section of leaders from all regions and backgrounds. The Committee focuses on driving increased diversity within our workforce, as well as creating a safe and engaging platform for dialogue on these issues for all our employees. Our commitment to creating a diverse and inclusive work environment is further validated by our employees, as reflected in the results of our recent employee engagement survey, where we received high scores in the areas of Diversity & Inclusion, Inclusiveness, and Non-Discrimination. Among other comments, employees shared that they are proud of the emphasis PerkinElmer places on diversity and inclusion, and on making PerkinElmer a place where everyone is valued and respected.\nTraining and Development\nWe are committed to the continued development and training of our employees. We seek to provide our employees with meaningful learning opportunities to help grow their capabilities and careers. We provide learning through a variety of channels and formats, including formal (classroom-based, blended learning solutions, digital learning) and informal, on-the-job learning. We are also dedicated to our employees’ professional development, with a pivotal component of our annual performance review and goal-setting process focused on providing employees with constructive and actionable feedback, as well as management support and engagement in the creation and completion of development goals. Our training opportunities are designed to promote learning across all levels of our organization. We seek to provide opportunities for our employees to grow their careers and regularly fill open vacancies with internal candidates. In addition, management periodically assesses succession planning for certain key positions and reviews our workforce to identify high potential employees for future growth and development. We also provide formal and informal training opportunities for our employees covering a variety of professional, technical and leadership topics.\nHealth and Safety\nOur success depends on the well-being of our employees, and one of our top priorities is to protect the health and safety of our employees. We maintain a culture focused on safety and strive to identify, eliminate, and control risk in the workplace to prevent injury and illness. Our employees have access to a global safety management system and are encouraged to report incidents, near misses, or other observations in the system. The system has been widely adopted in our manufacturing locations across the globe, and management uses the information generated by it to set safety-related policies and establish goals for future performance. Further, we provide our employees with a comprehensive benefits package that includes health insurance and other resources that support their physical and mental well-being. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken, and we continue to take, proactive, aggressive actions to protect the health and safety of our employees, customers, partners,\n13\nand suppliers. We enacted rigorous safety measures, including social distancing protocols, encouraging employees who do not need to be physically present on the manufacturing floor or in a lab to perform their work from home, suspending non-essential travel, implementing temperature checks and other access controls at the entrances to our facilities, extensively and frequently disinfecting our workspaces, and providing appropriate personal protective equipment to employees who are physically present at our facilities. We expect to continue to implement these measures until the COVID-19 pandemic is adequately contained, and we may take further actions as government authorities require or recommend, or as we determine to be in the best interests of our employees, customers, partners, and suppliers.\nCommunity\nAt PerkinElmer, we have long held the view that responsible global citizenship along with good governance principles and ethical business practices, are essential tenets for sustainability and success. We encourage our employees to support the communities in which they live and where we operate, and to assist in that effort, we fund a long-term charitable matching program for our employees. In addition, we have established a group comprised of management and subject matter experts at our company, to focus on developing and delivering on measurable advancements in the areas of reducing waste, reducing carbon emissions, and improving employee engagement and diversity."

    "text": "The following important factors affect our business and operations generally or affect multiple segments of our business and operations:\nRisks Related to our Business Operations and Industry\nIf the markets into which we sell our products decline or do not grow as anticipated due to a decline in general economic conditions, or there are uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals, or there are unfavorable changes in government regulations, we may see an adverse effect on the results of our business operations.\nOur customers include pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, laboratories, academic and research institutions, public health authorities, private healthcare organizations, doctors and government agencies. Our quarterly revenue and results of operations are highly dependent on the volume and timing of orders received during the quarter. In addition, our revenues and earnings forecasts for future quarters are often based on the expected trends in our markets. However, the markets we serve do not always experience the trends that we may expect. Negative fluctuations in our customers’ markets, the inability of our customers to secure credit or funding, restrictions in capital expenditures, general economic conditions, cuts in government funding or unfavorable changes in government regulations would likely result in a reduction in demand for our products and services. In addition, government funding is subject to economic conditions and the political process, which is inherently fluid and unpredictable. Our revenues may be adversely affected if our customers delay or reduce purchases as a result of uncertainties surrounding the approval of government or industrial funding proposals. Such declines could harm our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows and trading price of our common stock, and could limit our ability to sustain profitability.\nThe pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (“COVID-19”) is having, and may continue to have, a negative effect on the demand for certain of our products and our global operations including our manufacturing capabilities, logistics and supply chain that may materially and adversely impact our business, financial conditions, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe face risks related to public health crises and pandemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The global impact of COVID-19 has resulted in an adverse impact on our operations, supply chains and distribution systems, as significant global mitigation measures, including government-directed quarantines, social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, travel restrictions and/or bans, have been implemented, and in some areas relaxed, and then implemented again. Continued uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to the volatility of financial markets. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused extended global economic disruption, and a global recession is possible.\nWe have experienced significant reductions in demand for certain of our products due to the COVID-19 pandemic and although the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, additional impacts that we may experience include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in our stock price due to market volatility; further decreases in demand for certain of our products; reduced profitability; large-scale supply chain disruptions impeding our ability to ship and/or receive product; potential interruptions of, or limitations on manufacturing operations imposed by local, state or federal governments; shortages of key raw materials or components; workforce absenteeism and distraction; labor shortages including those resulting from unwillingness to comply with vaccination or other requirements; customer credit concerns; cybersecurity\n14\nrisks and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements; reduced sources of liquidity; increased borrowing costs; fluctuations in foreign currency markets; potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill; other asset impairment charges; increased obligations related to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans; and deferred tax valuation allowances.\nThe rapid and continually evolving development of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the extent to which mitigation measures will be effective, preclude any prediction as to its ultimate impact. However, we currently anticipate that business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic will continue to have a material adverse impact on the growth rate of certain of our businesses, and may also have a material adverse impact on our overall financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur Diagnostics segment has experienced an increase in revenue resulting from increased demand for our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics COVID-19 product offerings as well as from the COVID-19 testing laboratory facilities we have developed with the State of California and the United Kingdom. We expect demand for these products and services to decline during 2022, with revenue and valuation of our inventory largely contingent upon consumer demand for COVID-19 testing as well as our ability to develop and produce COVID-19 products and successfully staff and manage the laboratories.\nOur growth is subject to global economic and political conditions, and operational disruptions at our facilities.\nOur business is affected by global economic and political conditions as well as the state of the financial markets, particularly as the United States and other countries balance concerns around debt, inflation, growth and budget allocations in their policy initiatives. There can be no assurance that global economic conditions and financial markets will not worsen and that we will not experience any adverse effects that may be material to our consolidated cash flows, results of operations, financial position or our ability to access capital, such as the adverse effects resulting from a prolonged shutdown in government operations both in the United States and internationally. Our business is also affected by local economic environments, including inflation, recession, financial liquidity and currency volatility or devaluation. Political changes, including war or other conflicts, some of which may be disruptive, could interfere with our supply chain, our customers and all of our activities in a particular location.\nWhile we take precautions to prevent production or service interruptions at our global facilities, a major earthquake, fire, flood, power loss or other catastrophic event that results in the destruction or delay of any of our critical business operations could result in our incurring significant liability to customers or other third parties, cause significant reputational damage or have a material adverse effect on our business, operating results or financial condition.\nCertain of these risks can be hedged to a limited degree using financial instruments, or other measures, and some of these risks are insurable, but any such mitigation efforts are costly and may not always be fully successful. Our ability to engage in such mitigation efforts has decreased or become even more costly as a result of recent market developments.\nIf we do not introduce new products in a timely manner, we may lose market share and be unable to achieve revenue growth targets.\nWe sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological change, frequent new product and service introductions, and evolving customer needs and industry standards. Many of the businesses competing with us in these industries have significant financial and other resources to invest in new technologies, substantial intellectual property portfolios, substantial experience in new product development, regulatory expertise, manufacturing capabilities, and established distribution channels to deliver products to customers. Our products could become technologically obsolete over time, or we may invest in technology that does not lead to revenue growth or continue to sell products for which the demand from our customers is declining, in which case we may lose market share or not achieve our revenue growth targets. The success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors, including our ability to:\n•\naccurately anticipate customer needs,\n•\ninnovate and develop new reliable technologies and applications,\n•\nreceive regulatory approvals in a timely manner,\n•\nsuccessfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner,\n•\nprice our products competitively, and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time, and\n•\ndifferentiate our offerings from our competitors’ offerings.\n15\nMany of our products are used by our customers to develop, test and manufacture their products. We must anticipate industry trends and consistently develop new products to meet our customers’ expectations. In developing new products, we may be required to make significant investments before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product. If we fail to accurately foresee our customers’ needs and future activities, we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue. We may also suffer a loss in market share and potential revenue if we are unable to commercialize our technology in a timely and efficient manner.\nIn addition, some of our licensed technology is subject to contractual restrictions, which may limit our ability to develop or commercialize products for some applications.\nWe may not be able to successfully execute acquisitions or divestitures, license technologies, integrate acquired businesses or licensed technologies into our existing businesses, or make acquired businesses or licensed technologies profitable.\nWe have in the past supplemented, and may in the future supplement, our internal growth by acquiring businesses and licensing technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines, such as our recent acquisition of BioLegend, Inc. However, we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions or license transactions for many reasons, such as:\n•\ncompetition among buyers and licensees,\n•\nthe high valuations of businesses and technologies,\n•\nthe need for regulatory and other approval, and\n•\nour inability to raise capital to fund these acquisitions.\nSome of the businesses we acquire may be unprofitable or marginally profitable, or may increase the variability of our revenue recognition. If, for example, we are unable to successfully commercialize products and services related to significant in-process research and development that we have capitalized, we may have to impair the value of such assets. Accordingly, the earnings or losses of acquired businesses may dilute our earnings. For these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability, we would have to improve their management, operations, products and market penetration. We may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations, such as incompatible management, information or other systems, cultural differences, loss of key personnel, unforeseen regulatory requirements, previously undisclosed liabilities or difficulties in predicting financial results. Additionally, if we are not successful in selling businesses we seek to divest, the activity of such businesses may dilute our earnings and we may not be able to achieve the expected benefits of such divestitures. As a result, our financial results may differ from our forecasts or the expectations of the investment community in a given quarter or over the long term.\nTo finance our acquisitions, we may have to raise additional funds, either through public or private financings. We may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on terms unacceptable to us. We may also incur expenses related to completing acquisitions or licensing technologies, or in evaluating potential acquisitions or technologies, which may adversely impact our profitability.\nIf we do not compete effectively, our business will be harmed.\nWe encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business. We may not be able to compete effectively with all of these competitors. To remain competitive, we must develop new products and periodically enhance our existing products. We anticipate that we may also have to adjust the prices of many of our products to stay competitive. In addition, new competitors, technologies or market trends may emerge to threaten or reduce the value of entire product lines.\nOur quarterly operating results could be subject to significant fluctuation, and we may not be able to adjust our operations to effectively address changes we do not anticipate, which could increase the volatility of our stock price and potentially cause losses to our shareholders.\nGiven the nature of the markets in which we participate, we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability. Changes in competitive, market and economic conditions may require us to adjust our operations, and we may not be able to make those adjustments or make them quickly enough to adapt to changing conditions. A high proportion of our costs are fixed in the short term, due in part to our research and development and manufacturing costs. As a result, small declines in sales could disproportionately affect our operating results in a quarter. Factors that may affect our quarterly operating results include:\n•\ndemand for and market acceptance of our products,\n•\ncompetitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices,\n16\n•\nchanges in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business, including as a result of COVID-19 and other global health crises or pandemics,\n•\nchanges in general economic conditions or government funding,\n•\nsettlements of income tax audits,\n•\nexpenses incurred in connection with claims related to environmental conditions at locations where we conduct or formerly conducted operations,\n•\ncontract termination and litigation costs,\n•\ndiffering tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to taxation,\n•\nchanges in our effective tax rate,\n•\nchanges in industries, such as pharmaceutical and biomedical,\n•\nchanges in the portions of our revenue represented by our various products and customers,\n•\nour ability to introduce new products,\n•\nour competitors’ announcement or introduction of new products, services or technological innovations,\n•\ncosts of raw materials, labor, energy or supplies,\n•\nchanges in healthcare or other reimbursement rates paid by government agencies and other third parties for certain of our products and services,\n•\nour ability to realize the benefit of ongoing productivity initiatives,\n•\nchanges in the volume or timing of product orders,\n•\nfluctuation in the expense related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans,\n•\nchanges in our assumptions underlying future funding of pension obligations,\n•\nchanges in assumptions used to determine contingent consideration in acquisitions, and\n•\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates.\nA significant disruption in third-party package delivery and import/export services, or significant increases in prices for those services, could interfere with our ability to ship products, increase our costs and lower our profitability.\nWe ship a significant portion of our products to our customers through independent package delivery and import/export companies, including UPS and Federal Express in the United States; TNT, UPS and DHL in Europe; and UPS in Asia. We also ship our products through other carriers, including commercial airlines, freight carriers, national trucking firms, overnight carrier services and the United States Postal Service. If one or more of the package delivery or import/export providers experiences a significant disruption in services or institutes a significant price increase, including a service disruption as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we may have to seek alternative providers and the delivery of our products could be prevented or delayed. Such events could cause us to incur increased shipping costs that could not be passed on to our customers, negatively impacting our profitability and our relationships with certain of our customers.\nDisruptions in the supply of raw materials, certain key components and other goods from our limited or single source suppliers could have an adverse effect on the results of our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers.\nThe production of our products requires a wide variety of raw materials, key components and other goods that are generally available from alternate sources of supply. However, certain critical raw materials, key components and other goods required for the production and sale of some of our principal products are available from limited or single sources of supply. We generally have multi-year contracts with no minimum purchase requirements with these suppliers, but those contracts may not fully protect us from a failure by certain suppliers to supply critical materials or from the delays inherent in being required to change suppliers and, in some cases, validate new raw materials. Such raw materials, key components and other goods can usually be obtained from alternative sources with the potential for an increase in price, decline in quality or delay in delivery. A prolonged inability to obtain certain raw materials, key components or other goods is possible and could have an adverse effect on our business operations, and could damage our relationships with customers. In addition, a global health crisis or pandemic such as the COVID-19 pandemic could have a significant adverse effect on our supply chain.\n17\nWe are subject to the rules of the Securities and Exchange Commission requiring disclosure as to whether certain materials known as conflict minerals (tantalum, tin, gold, tungsten and their derivatives) that may be contained in our products are mined from the Democratic Republic of the Congo and adjoining countries. As a result of these rules, we may incur additional costs in complying with the disclosure requirements and in satisfying those customers who require that the components used in our products be certified as conflict-free, and the potential lack of availability of these materials at competitive prices could increase our production costs.\nIf we do not retain our key personnel, our ability to execute our business strategy will be limited.\nOur success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executive officers and key management and technical personnel, particularly our experienced engineers and scientists, and on our ability to continue to attract, retain, and motivate qualified personnel. The competition for these employees is intense. The loss of the services of key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. In addition, there could be a material adverse effect on us should the turnover rates for key personnel increase significantly or if we are unable to continue to attract qualified personnel. We do not maintain any key person life insurance policies on any of our officers or employees.\nOur success also depends on our ability to execute leadership succession plans. The inability to successfully transition key management roles could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nIf we experience a significant disruption in, or breach in security of, our information technology systems or those of our customers, suppliers or other third parties, or cybercrime, resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets, or if we fail to implement new systems, software and technologies successfully, our business could be adversely affected.\nWe rely on several centralized information technology systems throughout our company to develop, manufacture and provide products and services, keep financial records, process orders, manage inventory, process shipments to customers and operate other critical functions. Our and our third-party service providers' information technology systems may be susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, attacks by computer hackers, telecommunication failures, user errors, catastrophes or other unforeseen events. If we were to experience a prolonged system disruption in the information technology systems that involve our interactions with customers, suppliers or other third parties, it could result in the loss of sales and customers and significant incremental costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, security breaches of our information technology systems or cybercrime, resulting in inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information or assets, could result in losses or misappropriation of assets or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, partners, customers or suppliers, which could result in our suffering significant financial or reputational damage.\nOur results of operations will be adversely affected if we fail to realize the full value of our intangible assets.\nAs of January 2, 2022, our total assets included $11.5 billion of net intangible assets. Net intangible assets consist principally of goodwill associated with acquisitions and costs associated with securing patent rights, trademark rights, customer relationships, core technology and technology licenses and in-process research and development, net of accumulated amortization. We test certain of these items—specifically all of those that are considered “indefinite-lived”—at least annually for potential impairment by comparing the carrying value to the fair market value of the reporting unit to which they are assigned. All of our amortizing intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment should events occur that call into question the value of the intangible assets.\nAdverse changes in our business, adverse changes in the assumptions used to determine the fair value of our reporting units, or the failure to grow our Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics segments may result in impairment of our intangible assets, which could adversely affect our results of operations.\nRisks Related to our Intellectual Property\nWe may not be successful in adequately protecting our intellectual property.\nPatent and trade secret protection is important to us because developing new products, processes and technologies gives us a competitive advantage, although it is time-consuming and expensive. We own many United States and foreign patents and intend to apply for additional patents. Patent applications we file, however, may not result in issued patents or, if they do, the claims allowed in the patents may be narrower than what is needed to protect fully our products, processes and technologies. The expiration of our previously issued patents may cause us to lose a competitive advantage in certain of the products and services we provide. Similarly, applications to register our trademarks may not be granted in all countries in which they are\n18\nfiled. For our intellectual property that is protected by keeping it secret, such as trade secrets and know-how, we may not use adequate measures to protect this intellectual property.\nThird parties have in the past and may in the future also challenge the validity of our issued patents, may circumvent or “design around” our patents and patent applications, or claim that our products, processes or technologies infringe their patents. In addition, third parties may assert that our product names infringe their trademarks. We may incur significant expense in legal proceedings to protect our intellectual property against infringement by third parties or to defend against claims of infringement by third parties. Claims by third parties in pending or future lawsuits could result in awards of substantial damages against us or court orders that could effectively prevent us from manufacturing, using, importing or selling our products in the United States or other countries.\nIf we are unable to renew our licenses or otherwise lose our licensed rights, we may have to stop selling products or we may lose competitive advantage.\nWe may not be able to renew our existing licenses, or licenses we may obtain in the future, on terms acceptable to us, or at all. If we lose the rights to a patented or other proprietary technology, we may need to stop selling products incorporating that technology and possibly other products, redesign our products or lose a competitive advantage. Potential competitors could in-license technologies that we fail to license and potentially erode our market share.\nOur licenses typically subject us to various economic and commercialization obligations. If we fail to comply with these obligations, we could lose important rights under a license, such as the right to exclusivity in a market, or incur losses for failing to comply with our contractual obligations. In some cases, we could lose all rights under the license. In addition, rights granted under the license could be lost for reasons out of our control. For example, the licensor could lose patent protection for a number of reasons, including invalidity of the licensed patent, or a third-party could obtain a patent that curtails our freedom to operate under one or more licenses.\nRisks Related to Legal, Government and Regulatory Matters\nThe manufacture and sale of products and services may expose us to product and other liability claims for which we could have substantial liability.\nWe face an inherent business risk of exposure to product and other liability claims if our products, services or product candidates are alleged or found to have caused injury, damage or loss. We may be unable to obtain insurance with adequate levels of coverage for potential liability on acceptable terms or claims of this nature may be excluded from coverage under the terms of any insurance policy that we obtain. If we are unable to obtain such insurance or the amounts of any claims successfully brought against us substantially exceed our coverage, then our business could be adversely impacted.\nIf we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with the regulations of the United States Food and Drug Administration and other governmental agencies in the United States and abroad, we may be forced to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution, and we could be subject to civil, criminal or monetary penalties.\nOur operations are subject to regulation by different state and federal government agencies in the United States and other countries, as well as to the standards established by international standards bodies. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we could be subject to fines, penalties, criminal prosecution or other sanctions. Some of our products are subject to regulation by the United States Food and Drug Administration and similar foreign and domestic agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of product activities, from design and development to labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales and distribution. If we fail to comply with those regulations or standards, we may have to recall products, cease their manufacture and distribution, and may be subject to fines or criminal prosecution.\nWe are also subject to a variety of laws, regulations and standards that govern, among other things, the importation and exportation of products, the handling, transportation and manufacture of toxic or hazardous substances, the collection, storage, transfer, use, disclosure, retention and other processing of personal data, and our business practices in the United States and abroad such as anti-bribery, anti-corruption and competition laws. This requires that we devote substantial resources to maintaining our compliance with those laws, regulations and standards. A failure to do so could result in the imposition of civil, criminal or monetary penalties having a material adverse effect on our operations.\nChanges in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses.\nWe compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal, state, local and foreign regulations, such as environmental, health and safety, data privacy and food and drug regulations. We develop, configure and market our\n19\nproducts to meet customer needs created by these regulations. Any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products or increase our costs of producing these products.\nThe healthcare industry is highly regulated and if we fail to comply with its extensive system of laws and regulations, we could suffer fines and penalties or be required to make significant changes to our operations which could have a significant adverse effect on the results of our business operations.\nThe healthcare industry, including the genetic screening market, is subject to extensive and frequently changing international and United States federal, state and local laws and regulations. In addition, legislative provisions relating to healthcare fraud and abuse, patient privacy violations and misconduct involving government insurance programs provide federal enforcement personnel with substantial powers and remedies to pursue suspected violations. We believe that our business will continue to be subject to increasing regulation as the federal government continues to strengthen its position on healthcare matters, the scope and effect of which we cannot predict. If we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could suffer civil and criminal damages, fines and penalties, exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs, and the loss of various licenses, certificates and authorizations necessary to operate our business, as well as incur liabilities from third-party claims, all of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business.\nRisks Related to our Foreign Operations\nEconomic, political and other risks associated with foreign operations could adversely affect our international sales and profitability.\nBecause we sell our products worldwide, our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally. Our sales originating outside the United States represented the majority of our total revenue in fiscal year 2021. We anticipate that sales from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue. In addition, many of our manufacturing facilities, employees and suppliers are located outside the United States. Accordingly, our future results of operations could be harmed by a variety of factors, including:\n•\nchanges in actual, or from projected, foreign currency exchange rates,\n•\na global health crisis of unknown duration, such as the COVID-19 pandemic,\n•\nwars, conflicts, or other changes in a country’s or region’s political or economic conditions, particularly in developing or emerging markets,\n•\nlonger payment cycles of foreign customers and timing of collections in foreign jurisdictions,\n•\ntrade protection measures including embargoes, sanctions and tariffs, such as the sanctions recently implemented by the U.S. and other governments on the Russian Federation and related parties, the extent and impact of which have yet to be fully determined,\n•\nimport or export licensing requirements and the associated potential for delays or restrictions in the shipment of our products or the receipt of products from our suppliers,\n•\npolicies in foreign countries benefiting domestic manufacturers or other policies detrimental to companies headquartered in the United States,\n•\ndiffering tax laws and changes in those laws, or changes in the countries in which we are subject to tax,\n•\nadverse income tax audit settlements or loss of previously negotiated tax incentives,\n•\ndiffering business practices associated with foreign operations,\n•\ndifficulty in transferring cash between international operations and the United States,\n•\ndifficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations,\n•\ndiffering labor laws and changes in those laws,\n•\ndiffering protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection,\n•\nexpanded enforcement of laws related to data protection and personal privacy,\n•\nincreasing global enforcement of anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, and\n•\ndiffering regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements.\n20\nThe United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could adversely impact our results of operations.\nNearly 10% of our net sales from continuing operations in fiscal year 2021 came from the United Kingdom. Following the referendum vote in the United Kingdom in June 2016 in favor of leaving the European Union, on January 31, 2020, the country formally withdrew from the European Union (commonly referred to as “Brexit”) and, on December 24, 2020, the United Kingdom and the European Union entered into a Trade and Cooperation Agreement to govern the relationship between the United Kingdom and the European Union following Brexit. The potential effects of Brexit remain uncertain. Brexit has caused, and may continue to create, volatility in global stock markets and regional and global economic uncertainty particularly in the United Kingdom financial and banking markets. Weakening of economic conditions or economic uncertainties tend to harm our business, and if such conditions worsen in the United Kingdom or in the rest of Europe, it may have a material adverse effect on our operations and sales.\nAny significant weakening of the Great Britain Pound to the U.S. dollar will have an adverse impact on our European revenues due to the importance of our sales in the United Kingdom. Currency exchange rates in the pound sterling and the euro with respect to each other and the U.S. dollar have already been adversely affected by Brexit and that may continue to be the case.\nRisks Related to our Debt\nWe have a substantial amount of outstanding debt, which could impact our ability to obtain future financing and limit our ability to make other expenditures in the conduct of our business.\nWe have a substantial amount of debt and other financial obligations. Our debt level and related debt service obligations could have negative consequences, including:\n•\nrequiring us to dedicate significant cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our debt, which reduces the funds we have available for other purposes, such as acquisitions and stock repurchases;\n•\nreducing our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and market conditions;\n•\nexposing us to interest rate risk as a portion of our debt obligations are at variable rates;\n•\nincreasing our foreign currency risk as a portion of our debt obligations are in denominations other than the US dollar; and\n•\nincreasing the chances of a downgrade of our debt ratings due to the amount or intended purpose of our debt obligations.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness in the future to meet future financing needs. If we add new debt, the risks described above could increase. In addition, the market for both public and private debt offerings could experience liquidity concerns and increased volatility as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which could ultimately increase our borrowing costs and limit our ability to obtain future financing.\nRestrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and other debt instruments may limit our activities.\nOur senior unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan credit facility, senior unsecured notes due in 2023 (\"2023 Notes\"), senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (\"2024 Notes\"), senior unsecured notes due in 2026 (\"2026 Notes\"), senior unsecured notes due in 2028 (\"2028 Notes\"), senior unsecured notes due in 2029 (\"2029 Notes\"), senior unsecured notes due in 2031 (\"March 2031 Notes\"),  senior unsecured notes due in 2031 (\"September 2031 Notes\") and senior unsecured notes due in 2051 (\"2051 Notes\") include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to engage in activities that could otherwise benefit our company. These include restrictions on our ability and the ability of our subsidiaries to:\n•\npay dividends on, redeem or repurchase our capital stock,\n•\nsell assets,\n•\nincur obligations that restrict our subsidiaries’ ability to make dividend or other payments to us,\n•\nguarantee or secure indebtedness,\n•\nenter into transactions with affiliates, and\n•\nconsolidate, merge or transfer all, or substantially all, of our assets and the assets of our subsidiaries on a consolidated basis.\n21\nWe are also required to meet specified financial ratios under the terms of certain of our existing debt instruments. Our ability to comply with these financial restrictions and covenants is dependent on our future performance, which is subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors, including factors that are beyond our control, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates, changes in technology and changes in the level of competition. In addition, if we are unable to maintain our investment grade credit rating, our borrowing costs would increase and we would be subject to different and potentially more restrictive financial covenants under some of our existing debt instruments.\nAny future indebtedness that we incur may include similar or more restrictive covenants. Our failure to comply with any of the restrictions in our senior unsecured revolving credit facility, unsecured term loan credit facility, the 2023 Notes, the 2024 Notes, the 2026 Notes, the 2028 Notes, the 2029 Notes, the March 2031 Notes, the September 2031 Notes, the 2051 Notes or any future indebtedness may result in an event of default under those debt instruments, which could permit acceleration of the debt under those debt instruments, and require us to prepay that debt before its scheduled due date under certain circumstances.\nDiscontinuation, reform, or replacement of LIBOR may adversely affect our variable rate debt.\nOur indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan credit facility bear interest at fluctuating interest rates, primarily based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) for deposits of U.S. dollars. In July 2017, the United Kingdom Financial Conduct Authority (the authority that regulates LIBOR) announced that it intends to stop compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR after 2021. The discontinuation date for submission and publication of rates for certain tenors of U.S. dollar LIBOR (1-month, 3-month, 6-month, and 12-month) was subsequently extended by the ICE Benchmark Administration (the administrator of LIBOR) until June 30, 2023. It is unclear whether new methods of calculating LIBOR will be established such that it continues to exist after 2023. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee in the United States has proposed that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), calculated using short-term repurchase agreements backed by U.S. Treasury securities, is the rate that represents best practice as the alternative to U.S. dollar LIBOR for use in derivatives and other financial contracts that are currently indexed to LIBOR. If LIBOR is discontinued, reformed or replaced, we expect that our indebtedness under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan credit facility will be indexed to a replacement benchmark based on SOFR. Any such change could cause the effective interest rate under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured term loan credit facility and our overall interest expense to increase, in which event we may have difficulties making interest payments and funding our other fixed costs, and our available cash flow for general corporate requirements may be adversely affected.\nRisks Related to Ownership of our Common Stock\nOur share price will fluctuate.\nOver the last several years, stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have experienced significant price and volume volatility. Both the market price and the daily trading volume of our common stock may continue to be subject to significant fluctuations due not only to general stock market conditions but also to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations and business prospects. In addition to the risk factors discussed above, the price and volume volatility of our common stock may be affected by:\n•\noperating results that vary from our financial guidance or the expectations of securities analysts and investors,\n•\nthe financial performance of the major end markets that we target,\n•\nthe operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us,\n•\nannouncements of strategic developments, acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors,\n•\nchanges in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions, such as interest or foreign exchange rates, inflation, commodity and equity prices and the value of financial assets, and\n•\nchanges to economic conditions arising from global health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDividends on our common stock could be reduced or eliminated in the future.\nOn October 27, 2021, we announced that our\nBoard of Directors (our \"Board\") had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that was paid in February 2022\n. On January 27, 2022, we\nannounced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of\nfiscal year 2022\nthat will be payable in May 2022. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\n22"

The fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 (\"fiscal year 2020\") included 53 weeks. The fiscal year ending January 1, 2023 (\"fiscal year 2022\") will include 52 weeks.\nOverview of Fiscal Year 2021\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we continued to see strong returns from our acquisitions as well as our organic investments across technology, marketing and people. Our overall revenue in fiscal year 2021 increased $1,284.4 million, or 34%, as compared to fiscal year 2020, reflecting an increase of $865.0 million, or 42%, in our Diagnostics segment revenue and an increase o\nf $419.4 million, or 24%, in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue. Revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $219.7 million to the increase in our overall revenue during fiscal year 2021. The increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $749.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue. Our Diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of $61.9 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of $54.2 million in our applied genomics revenue. Revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $95.5 million to the increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021. The increase in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was driven by an increase of $305.1 million in our life sciences market revenue and an increase of $114.3 million in our applied markets revenue. Revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed $124.3 million to the increase in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021.\nIn our Diagnostics segment, we\nexperienced tremendous demand for our immunodiagnostics COVID-19 product offerings, particularly in the Americas, partially offset by a decline in demand for these product offerings in the Asia-Pacific region. We also experienced strong growth in our immunodiagnostics and applied genomics core product and service offerings across all regions. In our reproductive health business, an expanded range of product offerings and increased geographic reach more than offset the impact of declining birthrates.\nIn our Discovery & Analytical Solutions s\negment, the increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets, as well as an increase in revenue from our Informatics business. The increase in our applied markets revenue was driven by increased demand from our industrial, environmental and food markets.\nOur consolidated gross margins increased 49 basis points in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume, a favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain, partially offset by increased amortization expense. Our consolidated operating margin increased 42 basis points in fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily due to higher sales volume leverage and increased sales of our COVID-19 products offerings, which were partially offset by increased amortization of intangible assets, investments in new product development and growth initiatives.\nOverall, we believe that our strategic priorities and recent portfolio transformations, coupled with our expanded range of product offerings, leading market positions, global scale and financial strength provides us with a foundation for continued revenue growth, strong margins and cash flows, and long-term earnings per share growth.\n28\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $5.1 billion, as compared to $3.8 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion, or 34%, w\nhich includes an approximate 8% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures,\nand a\n1%\nincrease in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates.\nRevenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed\n$219.7 million to the increase\nin our overall revenue during fiscal year 2021.\nThe\nanalysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares segment revenue for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 and includes the effect of foreign exchange rate fluctuations, and acquisitions and divestitures. The total increase in revenue reflects an increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue of $865.0 million, or 42%, due to increased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $749.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue.\nOur Diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of $61.9 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of $54.2 million in our applied genomics revenue.\nOur Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue increased by $419.4 million, or 24%, due to an increase of $305.1 million from our life sciences market revenue and an increase of $114.3 million from our applied markets revenue. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.8 million of revenue primarily related to our Diagnostics segment for each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 and $1.8 million and $0.3 million of revenue primarily related to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment in fiscal years 2021 and 2020 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.\nCost of Revenue\nCost of revenue for fiscal year 2021 was $2.2 billion, as compared to $1.7 billion for fiscal year 2020, an increase of approximately $543.0 million, or 32%. As a percentage of revenue, cost of revenue decreased to 43.7% in fiscal year 2021 from 44.2% in fiscal year 2020, resulting in an increase in gross margin of approximately 49 basis points to 56.3% in fiscal year 2021 from 55.8% in fiscal year 2020. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $115.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $65.3 million for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $34.0 million. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $35.2 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $2.8 million for fiscal year 2020. Other purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $1.8 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $1.6 million was acquisition-related stock compensation and $0.2 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment. Asset impairment was $7.9 million for fiscal year 2020. In addition to the factors noted above, the overall increase in gross margin was primarily the result of higher sales volume, a favorable shift in product mix and continued productivity initiatives to improve our supply chain, partially offset by increased amortization expense.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $1,227.5 million, as compared to $917.9 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of approximately $309.6 million, or 33.7%. As a percentage of revenue, selling, general and administrative expenses decreased to 24.2% in fiscal year 2021 from 24.3% in fiscal year 2020. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $175.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $127.3 million for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $37.2 million. Acquisition and divestiture-related expenses added an incremental expense of $83.4 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $3.9 million was acquisition-related stock compensation, as compared to acquisition and divestiture-related expenses increasing expenses by $8.7 million for fiscal year 2020. Purchase accounting adjustments added an incremental expense of $3.2 million for fiscal year 2021, of which $3.1 million was change in contingent consideration and $0.1 million was increased depreciation on property, plant and equipment, as compared to purchase accounting adjustments decreasing expenses by $8.8 million for fiscal year 2020, which was attributable to change in contingent consideration. Asset impairment costs added an incremental expense of $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021. Legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements were $0.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $7.1 million for fiscal year 2020. Costs for significant environmental matters were $5.2 million for fiscal year 2020. In addition to the above items, the increase in selling, general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of costs related to investments in people, digital capabilities and innovation, and recent acquisitions amplified by pandemic-related cost controls and disruptions in the prior year.\nResearch and Development Expenses\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal year 2021 were $275.0 million, as compared to $205.4 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $69.6 million, or 33.9%. Research and development expenses from our 2021 acquisitions were $25.4\n29\nmillion. As a percentage of revenue, research and development expenses were flat at 5.4% in each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020.  Stock compensation related to our acquisitions added an incremental expense of $1.4 million in fiscal year 2021. Purchase accounting adjustments for depreciation on property, plant and equipment added an incremental expense of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2021. The increase in research and development expenses was driven by our investments in new product development.\nRestructuring and Other Costs, Net\nWe have undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of our operations with our growth strategy and the integration of our business units and productivity initiatives. Restructuring and other costs, net were $16.4 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $8.0 million for fiscal year 2020.\nWe implemented restructuring plans in fiscal years 2021 and 2020, consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives and integrate new acquisitions.\nWe have also terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and relocating operations and have recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to us. The aggregate charges for these actions totaled $0.2 million during fiscal year 2020. See Note 4,\nRestructuring and Other Costs, Net,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of the restructuring activities.\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:\nThe decrease of $19.7 million in interest and other expense, net, in fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020 was largely due to a net pension credit of $39.8 million in fiscal year 2021 as compared to a net pension cost of $18.8 million in fiscal year 2020, a decrease in other expense, net of $1.4 million and a change in fair value of financial securities of $11.0 million, partially offset by an increase of $52.4 million in interest expense in fiscal year 2021. The increase of $52.4 million in\ninterest expense in fiscal year 2021 was the result of\n$23.4 million\nof costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges\nthat were recognized in fiscal year 2021 and interest expense from new debt in fiscal year 2021. A more complete discussion of our liquidity is set forth below under the heading “Liquidity and Capital Resources.”\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe effective tax rates on continuing operations were 26.3% and 19.7% for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively. Certain of our subsidiaries have, at various times, been granted tax relief in their respective countries, resulting in lower income taxes than would otherwise be the case under ordinary tax rates. A reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\n30\nThe variation in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 is primarily affected by the recognition of $37.1 million in U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. taxes due when we repatriate foreign earnings that we no longer consider indefinitely reinvested. We also recognized $19.0 million in fiscal year 2021 and $21.8 million in fiscal year 2020 of benefits derived from tax holidays in China and Singapore. The effect of these benefits, derived from tax holidays, on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2021 was $0.16 and $0.16, respectively, and for fiscal year 2020 was $0.20 and $0.19, respectively. The tax holiday in China is renewed every three years. We expect to renew the tax holiday for two of our subsidiaries in China that expired in fiscal year 2021. The tax holiday for one of our subsidiaries in Singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2023.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2021.\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2021\nAcquisition of BioLegend, Inc.\nIn fiscal year 2021, we\ncompleted the acquisition of BioLegend, Inc. (\"BioLegend\") for an aggregate consideration\nof\n$5.7 billion.\nBioLegend's revenue and net loss for the period from the acquisition date to January 2, 2022 were $91.7 million and $25.8 million, respectively.\nOther acquisitions in 2021.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we also completed the acquisition of seven other businesses for aggregate consideration of $1.2 billion. The acquired businesses include Oxford Immunotec Global PLC for a total consideration of $590.9 million and Nexcelom Bioscience Holdings, LLC for a total consideration of $267.3 million, and five other businesses, which were acquired for a total consideration of $331.0 million.\nAcquisitions in Fiscal Year 2020\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we completed the acquisition of four businesses for aggregate consideration of $438.9 million. The acquired businesses include Horizon Discovery Group plc (“Horizon”), a company based in Cambridge, UK with approximately 400 employees, which was acquired on December 23, 2020 for a total consideration of $399.8 million (£296.0 million), and three other businesses which were acquired for a total consideration of $39.1 million.\n31\nSee Note 3,\nBusiness Combinations,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our acquisitions.\nReporting Segment Results of Continuing Operations\nDiscovery & Analytical Solutions\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $2,135.2 million, as compared to $1,715.8 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $419.4 million, or 24%, which includes an appro\nximate 12% increase in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures\nand a\n1%\nincrease in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contributed\n$124.3 million to the increase\nin our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment revenue during fiscal year 2021. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $1.8 million and $0.3 million of revenue primarily related to our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment for fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively, that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during the period. The analysis in the remainder of this paragraph compares revenue by end-market for fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, and includes the effect of foreign exchange fluctuations and acquisitions and divestitures. The increase in revenue in our Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment was a result of an increase of $305.1 million in our life sciences market revenue and an increase of $114.3 million in our applied markets revenue. The increase in our life sciences market revenue was the result of an increase in revenue in our pharmaceutical and biotechnology markets driven by continued growth of our Informatics business. The increase in our applied markets revenue was driven by increased demand from our industrial, environmental and food markets.\nOperating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2021 was $189.8 million, as compared to $183.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $6.3 million, or 3%. Amortization of intangible assets increased to $113.8 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $76.3 million for fiscal year 2020. Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted to $55.1 million. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $23.8 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $1.3 million for fiscal year 2020. Acquisition and divestiture-related costs, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $76.6 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to decreasing expenses by $4.0 million for fiscal year 2020. Legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements were $5.9 million for fiscal year 2020. Restructuring and other costs, net were $11.3 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $3.8 million for fiscal year 2020. Excluding the factors noted above, the overall increase in operating income for fiscal year 2021 as compared to fiscal year 2020, was primarily as a result of higher sales volume and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased investments in new product development and growth initiatives.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2021.\nDiagnostics\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nRevenue for fiscal year 2021 was $2,931.9 million, as compared to $2,066.9 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $865.0 million, or 42%, which includes an appro\nximate\n5%\nincrease in revenue attributable to acquisitions and divestitures\nand a 2% increase in revenue attributable to favorable changes in foreign exchange rates. Revenue from our 2021 acquisitions contribute\nd $95.5 million to the increase in our Dia\ngnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021. As a result of adjustments to deferred revenue related to certain acquisitions required by business combination rules, we did not recognize $0.8 million of revenue for each of fiscal years 2021 and 2020 that otherwise would have been recorded by the acquired businesses during each of the respective periods.\nThe increase in our Diagnostics segment revenue during fiscal year 2021 was primarily driven by increased demand for our COVID-19 product offerings resulting in an increase of $749.0 million in our immunodiagnostics revenue. Our Diagnostics segment revenue also increased during fiscal year 2021 due to growth in our core product offerings resulting in an increase of $61.9 million in our reproductive health revenue and an increase of $54.2 million in our applied genomics revenue.\n32\nOperating income from continuing operations for fiscal year 2021 was $1,219.9 million, as compared to $874.2 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $345.7 million, or 40%. Amortization of intangible assets increased and was $176.5 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $116.3 million for fiscal year 2020.  Amortization of intangible assets from our 2021 acquisitions amounted\nto $16.2 million. Restructuring and other costs, net increased and were $5.1 million for fiscal year 2021 as compared to $4.3 million for fiscal year 2020.\nAcquisition and divestiture-related expenses, contingent consideration and other costs added an incremental expense of $15.9 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to an incremental expense of $5.0 million for fiscal year 2020. The amortization of purchase accounting adjustments to record the inventory from certain acquisitions added an incremental expense of $11.4 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $1.5 million for fiscal year 2020. Legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements were $0.1 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $1.2 million for fiscal year 2020. Asset impairment was $3.9 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $7.9 million for fiscal year 2020. Excluding the factors noted above, operating income increased during fiscal year 2021, as compared to fiscal year 2020, primarily as a result of higher sales volume and favorable product mix, partially offset by increased investments in new product development and growth initiatives.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2021.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require cash to pay our operating expenses, make capital expenditures, make strategic acquisitions, service our debt and other long-term liabilities, repurchase shares of our common stock and pay dividends on our common stock. Our principal sources of funds are cash flows from our operations, borrowing capacity available under our senior unsecured credit facility and access to the debt markets. We anticipate that our internal operations will generate sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, smaller acquisitions, interest payments on our debt and dividends on our common stock. However, we expect to use external sources to satisfy the balance of our debt when due, any larger acquisitions and other long-term liabilities, such as contributions to our postretirement benefit plans.\nWe and our subsidiaries and affiliates may from time to time, in our sole discretion, purchase, repay, redeem or retire any of our outstanding debt securities (including any publicly issued debt securities), in privately negotiated or open market transactions, by tender offer or otherwise, or extend or refinance any of our outstanding indebtedness.\nPrincipal factors that could affect the availability of our internally generated funds include:\n•\nchanges in sales due to weakness in markets in which we sell our products and services, and\n•\nchanges in our working capital requirements.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:\n•\nfinancial covenants contained in the financial instruments controlling our borrowings that limit our total borrowing capacity,\n•\nincreases in interest rates applicable to our outstanding variable rate debt,\n•\na ratings downgrade that could limit the amount we can borrow under our senior unsecured revolving credit facility and our overall access to the corporate debt market,\n•\nincreases in interest rates or credit spreads, as well as limitations on the availability of credit, that affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis,\n•\na decrease in the market price for our common stock, and\n•\nvolatility in the public debt and equity markets.\nCash Flows\nFiscal Year 2021 Compared to Fiscal Year 2020\nOperating Activities.\nNet cash provided by continuing operations was $1,410.8 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $892.2 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $518.6 million. The cash provided by operating activities for fiscal year 2021 was principally a result of income from continuing operations of $943.3 million, adjustments for non-cash charges\n33\naggregating to $363.1 million, including depreciation and amortization of $358.0 million, and a net cash increase in working capital of $104.4 million. During fiscal year 2021, $1.7 million of contingent consideration payments were included in operating activities. During fiscal year 2021, we contributed $6.9 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States, and $20.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States for the plan year 2019.\nInvesting Activities.\nNet cash used in the investing activities of our continuing operations was $4,112.8 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to $504.5 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $3,608.3 million. For fiscal year 2021, we used $3,991.3 million of net cash for acquisitions, as compared to $411.5 million used in fiscal year 2020. Capital expenditures for fiscal year 2021 were $99.9 million, primarily for manufacturing equipment and other capital equipment purchases, as compared to $77.5 million for fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we purchased investments amounting to $23.1 million as compared to $20.1 million in fiscal year 2020. These items were partially offset by $1.5 million in proceeds from disposition of businesses and assets in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $4.3 million in fiscal year 2020, and by proceeds from surrender of life insurance policies of $0.1 million in fiscal year 2021, as compared to $0.3 million in fiscal year 2020.\nFinancing Activities.\nNet cash provided by the financing activities of our continuing operations was $2,941.7 million for fiscal year 2021, as compared to net cash used in the financing activities of our continuing operations of $202.9 million for fiscal year 2020, an increase of $3,144.5 million in net cash used in financing activities. The cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was a result of proceeds from the sale of unsecured senior notes, proceeds from borrowings, proceeds from a term loan and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans. During fiscal year 2021, proceeds from the sale of unsecured senior notes were $3,086.1 million, our proceeds from debt borrowings totaled $1,400.3 million and proceeds from a term loan were $500.0 million. These were partially offset by payments on borrowings of $1,559.1 million, payments of senior unsecured notes of $339.6 million and debt issuance costs of $31.0 million during fiscal year 2021. This compares to debt borrowings of $714.7 million, which were more than offset by debt payments of $897.7 million during fiscal year 2021. Proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans were $25.1 million during fiscal year 2021, as compared to $37.7 million for fiscal year 2020. This cash provided by financing activities during fiscal year 2021 was partially offset by repurchases of our common stock, payments of dividends, net payments on other credit facilities settlement of swap and settlement of cash flow hedges. During fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 433,000 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program and 71,248 shares of our common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans, for a total cost of $73.1 million. This compares to repurchases of 72,251 shares of our common stock pursuant to our equity incentive plans in fiscal year 2020, for a total cost of $6.9 million. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $32.4 million in dividends as compared to $31.2 million for fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $14.3 million for settlement of a swap. During fiscal year 2021, we had net payments on other credit facilities of $13.7 million as compared to $4.5 million for fiscal year 2020. We paid $4.5 million in settlement of hedges during fiscal year 2021 as compared to $4.6 million for fiscal year 2020. During fiscal year 2021, we paid $2.2 million for acquisition-related contingent consideration as compared to $10.4 million in fiscal year 2020.\nFiscal Year 2020 Compared to Fiscal Year 2019\nFor a discussion of our results of operations for fiscal year 2020 as compared to fiscal year 2019, see Item 7, Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations in our annual report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 2, 2021.\nBorrowing Arrangements\nSee Note 13,\nDebt,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our borrowing arrangements.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors (our \"Board\") declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $0.07 per share in each quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020, resulting in an annual dividend rate of $0.28 per share. At January 2, 2022, we had accrued $8.8 million for a dividend declared in October 2021 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that was paid in February 2022. On January 27, 2022, we announced that our Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $0.07 per share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 that will be payable in May 2022. In the future, our Board may determine to reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\n34\nCapital Expenditures\nDuring fiscal year 2022, we expect to invest an amount for capital expenditures similar to that in fiscal year 2021, primarily to introduce new products, to improve our operating processes, to shift the production capacity to lower cost locations, and to develop information technology. We expect to use our available cash and internally generated funds to fund these expenditures.\nOther Potential Liquidity Considerations\nAt January 2, 2022, we had cash and cash equivalents of $618.3 million, of which $526.3 million was held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries, and we had $1.5 billion of additional borrowing capacity available under a senior unsecured revolving credit facility. We had no other liquid investments at January 2, 2022.\nWe utilize a variety of tax planning and financing strategies to ensure that our worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed. We use our non-U.S. cash for needs outside of the U.S. including foreign operations,\ncapital investments, acquisitions and repayment of debt. In addition, we also transfer cash to the U.S. using nontaxable returns of capital, distributions of previously taxed income, as well as dividends, where the related income tax cost is managed efficiently.\nPrior to enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the \"Tax Act\"), we did not provide deferred income tax expense on the cumulative undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, we accrued for a one-time transition tax expense of $85.0 million on our unremitted foreign earnings in accordance with the Tax Act. The U.S. Treasury subsequently issued regulations on the Tax Act and we recorded tax expense (benefit) of $2.7 million and $(4.6) million during fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively. We continue to make our scheduled tax payments associated with this one-time transition tax expense accrual.\nAs of January 2, 2022, we evaluated our undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately $1.2 billion in earnings that we no longer considered indefinitely reinvested. We intend to begin repatriating such earnings to the U.S., in whole or in part, during fiscal year 2022. In doing so, we have recorded a provision of approximately $37.1 million for the U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated. No additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested.\nOn July 31, 2020, our Board authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $250.0 million under a stock repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\"). The Repurchase Program will expire on July 27, 2022 unless terminated earlier by our Board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 433,000 shares of common stock under the Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $62.6 million. As of January 2, 2022, $187.4 million remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the Repurchase Program.\nIn addition, our Board has authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to our equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to our equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2021, we repurchased 71,248 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $10.5 million. During fiscal year 2020, we repurchased 72,251 shares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $6.9 million.\nThe repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value. Any repurchased shares will be available for use in connection with corporate programs. If we continue to repurchase shares, the Repurchase Program will be funded using our existing financial resources, including cash and cash equivalents, and our existing senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nAs of January 2, 2022, we may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $108.4 million. As of January 2, 2022, we have recorded contingent consideration obligations of $58.0 million, of which $1.3 million was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $56.7 million was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed 6.9 years from January 2, 2022, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at January 2, 2022 was 5.4 years.\nDistressed global financial markets could adversely impact general economic conditions by reducing liquidity and credit availability, creating increased volatility in security prices, widening credit spreads and decreasing valuations of certain investments. The widening of credit spreads may create a less favorable environment for certain of our businesses and may affect the fair value of financial instruments that we issue or hold. Increases in credit spreads, as well as limitations on the\n35\navailability of credit at rates we consider to be reasonable, could affect our ability to borrow under future potential facilities on a secured or unsecured basis, which may adversely affect our liquidity and results of operations. In difficult global financial markets, we may be forced to fund our operations at a higher cost, or we may be unable to raise as much funding as we need to support our business activities.\nOur pension plans have not experienced a material impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility and uncertainty in the credit markets. With respect to plans outside of the United States, we expect to contribute $7.0 million in the aggregate during fiscal year 2022. During fiscal years 2021 and 2020, we contributed $6.9 million and $7.5 million, in the aggregate, to pension plans outside of the United States, respectively. During fiscal year 2021, we contributed $20.0 million to our defined benefit pension plan in the United States for the plan year 2019. We could potentially have to make additional funding payments in future periods for all pension plans. We expect to use existing cash and external sources to satisfy future contributions to our pension plans.\nWe are conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at our current and former locations, and are subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of our business activities. Although we have established accruals for potential losses that we believe are probable and reasonably estimable, in our opinion, based on our review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at January 2, 2022 should not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on Form 10-K. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to us. See “Business—Environmental Matters\n”\nabove and\nNote 16,\nContingencies,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of these matters and proceedings.\nEffects of Recently Issued and Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 1,\nNature of Operations and Accounting Policies,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recently adopted and issued accounting pronouncements.\nApplication of Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to accounting for business combinations, long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles and employee compensation and benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness combinations.\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses; restructuring costs associated with a business combination are expensed subsequent to the acquisition date; and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date affect income tax expense. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities as\nsumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. For intangible assets, we normally utilize the \"income method\" which incorporates the forecast of all the expected future net cash flows attributable to the subject intangible asset, adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams. Depending on the asset valued, the key assumptions included one or more of the following: (1) future revenue growth rates, (2) future gross margin, (3) future selling, general and administrative expenses, (4) royalty rates, (5) customer attrition rates, and (6) discount rates. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of\nfinite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed. The fair value of contingent consideration is remeasured each period based on relevant information and changes to the fair value are included in the operating results for the period.\n36\nValue of long-lived assets, including goodwill and other intangibles.\nWe carry a variety of long-lived assets on our consolidated balance sheets including property and equipment, operating lease right of use assets, investments, identifiable intangible assets, and goodwill. We periodically review the carrying value of all of these assets based, in part, upon current estimates of fair values and our projections of anticipated future cash flows. We undertake this review (i) on an annual basis for assets such as goodwill and non-amortizing intangible assets and (ii) on a periodic basis for other long-lived assets when facts and circumstances suggest that cash flows related to those assets may be diminished. Any impairment charge that we record reduces our earnings.\nFor goodwill, the test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. We perform the annual impairment assessment on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. This same impairment test will be performed at other times during the course of the year should an event occur which suggests that the recoverability of goodwill should be reconsidered. We completed the annual goodwill impairment test using a measurement date of January 4, 2021, and concluded that there was no goodwill impairment. At January 4, 2021, the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20.0% for each reporting unit, except for our Tulip reporting unit, which had a fair value that was between 10% and 20% more than its carrying value. The range of the long-term terminal growth rates for the reporting units was 3.0% to 5.0% for the fiscal year 2021 impairment analysis. The range for the discount rates for the reporting units was 8.0% to 12.5%. Keeping all other variables constant, a 10.0% change in any one of these input assumptions for the vari\nous reporting units, except for our Tulip reporting unit, would still allow us to conclude that there was no impairment of goodwill. At January 2, 2022, the operating performance of our Tulip reporting unit exceeded the original forecast and the forecast for this reporting unit no longer indicates any sensitivity that would lead to a material impairment charge.\nWe consistently employ the income approach to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of goodwill. A number of significant assumptions and estimates are involved in the application of the income approach to forecast operating cash flows, including markets and market share, sales volumes and prices, costs to produce, tax rates, capital spending, discount rates and working capital changes. Cash flow forecasts are based on approved business unit operating plans for the early years’ cash flows and historical relationships in later years. The income approach is sensitive to changes in long-term terminal growth rates and the discount rates. The long-term terminal growth rates are consistent with our historical long-term terminal growth rates, as the current economic trends are not expected to affect our long-term terminal growth rates. We corroborate the income approach with a market approach. While we believe that our estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which we serve, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.\nEmployee compensation and benefits.\nWe sponsor both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. Retirement and postretirement benefit plans are a significant cost of doing business, and represent obligations that will be ultimately settled far in the future, and therefore are subject to estimation. Retirement and postretirement benefit plan expenses are allocated to cost of revenue, research and development, and selling, general and administrative expenses, in our consolidated statements of operations. We immediately recognize actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to our fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless we are required to perform an interim remeasurement.\nWe recognized a gain of $30.9 million in fiscal year 2021 and a loss of $18.0 million in fiscal year 2020, for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, which include the charge or benefit for the mark-to-market adjustment for the benefit plans, which was recorded in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The loss or income related to the mark-to-market adjustment on benefit plans was a pre-tax gain of $24.7 million in fiscal year 2021 and a pre-tax loss of $25.4 million in fiscal year 2020. We expect income of approximately $5.4 million in fiscal year 2022 for our retirement and postretirement benefit plans, excluding the charge for or benefit from the mark-to-market adjustment. It is difficult to reliably calculate and predict whether there will be a mark-to-market adjustment in fiscal year 2022. Mark-to-market adjustments are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond our control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. To the extent the discount rates decrease or the value of our pension and postretirement investments decrease, mark-to market charges to operations will be recorded in fiscal year 2022. Conversely, to the extent the discount rates increase or the value of our pension and postretirement investments increase more than expected, mark-to market income will be recorded in fiscal year 2022. Pension accounting is intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over the employee’s approximate service period based on the terms of the plans and the investment and funding decisions made. We are required to make assumptions regarding such variables as the expected long-term rate of return on assets, the discount rate applied and mortality assumptions, to determine service cost and interest cost, in order to arrive at expected pension income or expense for the year. We use discount rates for each individual plan based upon the expected cash flows using the applicable spot rates derived from a yield curve over the projected cash flow period.\n37\nIf any of our assumptions were to change as of January 2, 2022, our pension plan expenses would also change as follows:"

    "text": "Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nFinancial Instruments\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of temporary cash investments, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. We believe we had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2022.\nWe use derivative instruments as part of our risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. We enter into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and have policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor do we use leveraged financial instruments.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we enter into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed 12 months, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPrincipal hedged currencies include the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, Singapore Dollar and Swedish Krona. We held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling $371.9 million at January 2, 2022, $808.0 million at January 3, 2021, and $277.6 million at December 29, 2019, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally 30 days or less during each of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIn addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions and stock repurchase program, we enters into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. We record these hedges at fair value on our consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements, included combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $360.2 million as of January 2, 2022, combined Euro notional amounts of €33.4 million and combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $499.0 million as of January 3, 2021, and combined Euro notional amounts of €105.8 million and combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $5.6 million as of December 29, 2019. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, we designated a portion of the 2026 Notes to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 Notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of January 2,\n38\n2022, the total notional amount of the 2026 Notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €497.2 million. The unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge were $(33.2) million, $49.6 million and $4.9 million during the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, we entered into a cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge to hedge the Euro currency exposure of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. This agreement is a contract to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. Changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of this hedge, we use a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related swap. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment, and then are amortized into other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations using a systematic and rational method over the instrument’s term. Changes in the fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e. those changes due to the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment. The cross-currency swap had an initial notional value of €197.4 million or $220.0 million and matured on November 15, 2021. Interest on the cross-currency swap was payable semi-annually, in Euro, on May 15th and November 15th of each year based on the Euro notional value and a fixed rate of 2.47%. We received interest in U.S. dollars on May 15th and November 15th of each year based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Euro notional value and a fixed rate of 5.00%.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge the 2021 Notes. The effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges were reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, we redeemed all of its outstanding 2021 Notes and settled the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges. The foreign exchange losses (gains) recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges were $9.5 million and $(29.3) million d\nur\ning the fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we entered into forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge a portion of the 2026 Notes. The effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges will be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges. The foreign exchange loss recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges was $8.7 million during  fiscal year 2021.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, we entered into two interest rate swaption agreements (together, the “Swaptions”) with expiration dates of September 30, 2021 in anticipation of issuing notes to fund the acquisition of BioLegend. The first Swaption had a term of 2 months and hedged an anticipated 10-year note offering, with a notional value of $500.0 million. The second Swaption had a term of 2 months and hedged an anticipated 7-year note offering, with a notional value of $500.0 million. We designated the Swaptions as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for these derivatives as cash flow hedges. On September 8, 2021, we sold both Swaptions, and as a result, recognized a loss of $8.2 million in interest and other expense, net during the fiscal year 2021. We also recorded other comprehensive income of $3.8 million, which will be amortized to interest and other expense, net over the 7 and 10 year terms, respectively, of the related permanent financing.\nWe do not expect any material net pre-tax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into interest and other expense, net within the next twelve months.\nSee Note 19,\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities,\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements for a detailed discussion of our derivative instruments and hedging activities.\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk.\nWe are exposed to market risk, including changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted market exposures.\nForeign Exchange Risk.\nThe potential change in foreign currency exchange rates offers a substantial risk to us, as approximately 60% of our business is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. Our risk management strategy currently uses forward contracts to mitigate certain balance sheet foreign currency transaction exposures. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures, with gains and losses resulting from the forward contracts that hedge these exposures. Moreover, we are able to partially mitigate the impact that fluctuations in currencies have on our net income as a result of our manufacturing facilities located in countries outside the\n39\nUnited States, material sourcing and other spending which occur in countries outside the United States, resulting in natural hedges.\nAlthough we attempt to manage our foreign currency exchange risk through the above activities, when the U.S. dollar weakens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will in general be positively but not proportionately impacted. Conversely, when the U.S. dollar strengthens against other currencies in which we transact business, sales and net income will in general be negatively but not proportionately impacted.\nForeign Currency Risk—Value-at-Risk Disclosure\n. We utilize a Value-at-Risk model to determine the potential earning/fair value exposures presented by our foreign currency related financial instruments. As discussed above, we seek to minimize this exposure through our hedging program. Our Value-at-Risk computation is based on the Monte Carlo simulation, utilizing a 95% confidence interval and a holding period of 30 days. As of January 2, 2022, this computation estimated that there is a 5% chance that the market value of the underlying exposures and the corresponding derivative instruments either increase or decrease due to foreign currency fluctuations by more than $31,500. This Value-At-Risk measure is consistent with our financial statement disclosures relative to our foreign currency hedging program. Specifically, during each of the four quarters ended in fiscal year 2021, the Value-At-Risk ranged between $0.1 million and $0.4 million, with an average of approximately $0.3 million.\nInterest Rate Risk.\nAs of January 2, 2022, we had $500.0 million in outstanding borrowings under our senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facilities. Amounts drawn under our senior unsecured revolving credit and term loan facilities bear interest at variable rates; all of our other debt bear interest at fixed rates. Our cash and cash equivalents, for which we receive interest at variable rates, were $618.3 million at January 2, 2022. Fluctuations in interest rates can therefore have a direct impact on both our short-term cash flows, as they relate to interest, and our earnings. To manage the volatility relating to these exposures, we periodically enter into various derivative transactions pursuant to our policies to hedge against known or forecasted interest rate exposures.\nInterest Rate Risk—Sensitivity\n. Our current earnings exposure for changes in interest rates can be summarized as follows:\n(i) Changes in interest rates can cause our cash flows to fluctuate. An increase of 10%, or approximately 12 basis points, in current interest rates would cause our cash outflows to increase by $0.6 million for fiscal year 2022.\n(ii) Changes in interest rates can cause our interest income and cash flows to fluctuate.\n40"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 2, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (\"PCAOB\"), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 3, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nBusiness Combinations – Identifiable Intangible Assets– Refer to Note 3 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company completed the acquisition of BioLegend, Inc. for\n$\n5.7\nbillion\nin total consideration, net of cash acquired during the third quarter of fiscal year 2021. In addition, the Company completed the acquisition of seven other businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n1.2\nbillion during fiscal year 2021. The Company accounted for the acquisitions under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including identifiable intangible assets totaling $\n2.5\nbillion in the BioLegend acquisition and $\n0.5\nbillion in the other seven acquisitions. Of the identifiable intangible assets acquired, the most significant included core technology of $\n1.1\nbillion and customer relationships of $\n1.9\nbillion. Management estimated the fair value of these intangible assets using customary valuation procedures and techniques, including income approach methods. The fair value determination of the intangible assets acquired required management to make significant estimates and assumptions related to revenue forecasts and the selection of the discount rates.\nWe identified the valuation of the intangible assets as a critical audit matter because of the significant estimates and assumptions management made to measure the fair value of the identifiable intangible assets acquired for purposes of the purchase price allocation. These fair value measurements required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists, when performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts and the selection of the discount rates for the identified intangible assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the revenue forecasts and the selection of the discount rates for the identifiable intangible assets included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets, including management’s controls over revenue forecasts and selection of the discount rates.\n•\nWe assessed the reasonableness of management’s revenue forecasts by performing the following, on a sample basis:\n–\nWe compared the revenue forecasts to historical results.\n–\nWe compared the revenue forecasts to internal communications to management and the Board of Directors and other information obtained while performing the audit.\n–\nWe compared the growth rates to similar businesses acquired by the Company, to the Company’s legacy operations that operate in a similar business, and to peer companies.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we also performed the following, on a sample basis:\n–\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of the valuation methodologies selected.\n–\nWe tested the source information underlying the determination of the discount rates, tested the mathematical accuracy of the calculations and compared those to the amounts selected by management.\n/s /\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 3, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\n42\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n43\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n44\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n45\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n46\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the Fiscal Years Ende\nd\n47\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n48\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1:\nNature of Operations and Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations:\nPerkinElmer, Inc. is a leading provider of products, services and solutions to the diagnostics, life sciences and applied markets. Through its advanced technologies and differentiated solutions, critical issues are addressed that help to improve lives and the world around us.\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of PerkinElmer, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company has two operating segments: Discovery & Analytical Solutions and Diagnostics. The Company's Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment focuses on service and innovating for customers spanning the life sciences and applied markets. The Company's Diagnostics segment is targeted towards meeting the needs of clinically-oriented customers, especially within the growing areas of reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics.\nThe Company's fiscal year ends on the Sunday nearest December 31. The Company reports fiscal years under a 52/53 week format and as a result, certain fiscal years will contain 53 weeks. Each of the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 (\"fiscal year 2021\") and December 29, 2019 (\"fiscal year 2019\") included\n52\nweeks. The fiscal year ended January 3, 2021 (\"fiscal year 2020\") included\n53\nweeks.\nThe fiscal year ending January 1, 2023 (\"fiscal year 2022\") will include\n52\nweeks.\nAccounting Policies and Estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with United States (“U.S.”) Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”) requires the Company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nThe Company enters into contracts that can include various combinations of products and services, which are generally capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations. The Company recognizes revenue in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for the promised products or services when a performance obligation is satisfied by transferring control of those products or services to customers.\nTaxes that are collected by the Company from a customer and assessed by a governmental authority, that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction, are excluded from revenue.\nThe Company reports shipping and handling revenue in revenue, to the extent it is billed to customers, and the associated costs in cost of product revenue.\nWarranty Costs:\nThe Company provides for estimated warranty costs for products at the time of their sale. Warranty liabilities are estimated using expected future repair costs based on historical labor and material costs incurred during the warranty period. Warranty costs were not material in the periods presented.\nInventories\n:  Inventories, which include material, labor and manufacturing overhead, are valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventories are accounted for using the first-in, first-out method of determining inventory costs. Inventory quantities on-hand are regularly reviewed, and where necessary, provisions for excess and obsolete inventory are recorded based primarily on the Company’s estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under the asset and liability method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases. This method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits such as net operating loss carryforwards, to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the fiscal years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. A valuation allowance is established for any deferred tax asset for which realization is not more likely than not.\nThe Company provides reserves for potential payments of tax to various tax authorities related to uncertain tax positions and other issues. These reserves are based on a determination of whether and how much of a tax benefit taken by the Company in its tax filings or positions is more likely than not to be realized following resolution of any potential contingencies present\n49\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nrelated to the tax benefit. Potential interest and penalties associated with such uncertain tax positions is recorded as a component of income tax expense.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nThe Company depreciates property, plant and equipment using the straight-line method over its estimated useful lives, which generally fall within the following ranges: buildings-\n10\nto\n40\nyears; leasehold improvements - estimated useful life or remaining term of lease, whichever is shorter; and machinery and equipment-\n3\nto\n8\nyears. Certain tooling costs are capitalized and amortized over a\n3\n-year life, while repairs and maintenance costs are expensed.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits:\nThe Company sponsors both funded and unfunded U.S. and non-U.S. defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits. The Company immediately recognizes actuarial gains and losses in operating results in the year in which the gains and losses occur. Actuarial gains and losses are measured annually as of the calendar month-end that is closest to the Company's fiscal year end and accordingly will be recorded in the fourth quarter, unless the Company is required to perform an interim remeasurement. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and assumed return on plan assets, are recorded on a quarterly basis. The Company’s funding policy provides that payments to the U.S. pension trusts shall at least be equal to the minimum funding requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974. Non-U.S. plans are accrued for, but generally not fully funded, and benefits are paid from operating funds.\nTranslation of Foreign Currencies:\nFor foreign operations, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates; income and expenses are translated using weighted average exchange rates for the reporting period. Resulting translation adjustments, as well as translation gains and losses from certain intercompany transactions considered permanent in nature, are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\"), a separate component of stockholders’ equity. Gains and losses arising from transactions and translation of period-end balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency are included in other expense, net\n.\nBusiness Combinations:\nBusiness combinations are accounted for at fair value. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses. Measurement period adjustments are made in the period in which the amounts are determined and the current period income effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition date. All changes that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments are also included in current period earnings. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair value for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates, the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite-lived intangible assets, or the recognition of additional consideration which would be expensed.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nThe Company’s intangible assets consist of (i) goodwill, which is not being amortized; (ii) indefinite lived intangibles, which consist of a trade name that is not subject to amortization; and (iii) amortizing intangibles, which consist of patents, trade names and trademarks, licenses, customer relationships and purchased technologies, which are being amortized over their estimated useful lives.\nThe process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. This annual impairment assessment is performed by the Company on the later of January 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of the amortizing intangible asset\n.\nAmortizing intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when indicators of impairment are present. When a potential impairment has been identified, forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the long-lived assets present in that operation. If such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts, long-lived assets, including such intangibles, are written down to their respective fair values.\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation expense based on estimated grant date fair value, generally using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value is recognized as expense in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period. The determination of fair value and the timing of expense using option\n50\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\npricing models such as the Black-Scholes model require the input of subjective assumptions, including the expected term and the expected price volatility of the underlying stock. The Company estimates the expected term assumption based on historical experience. In determining the Company’s expected stock price volatility assumption, the Company reviews both the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s common stock.\nMarketable Securities and Investments:\nInvestments in debt securities that are classified as available for sale are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income until realized. Investments in equity securities are recorded at their fair values with unrealized holding gains and losses included in earnings. Investments in equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are carried at cost minus impairment, if any.\nWhen an observable price change in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer has occurred, the Company elects to carry those equity investments at fair value as of the date that the observable transaction occurred.\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nThe Company considers all highly liquid, unrestricted instruments with a purchased maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of cash equivalents approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments.\nEnvironmental Matters:\nThe Company accrues for costs associated with the remediation of environmental pollution when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the Company’s proportionate share of the amount can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities have not been discounted.\nResearch and Development:\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred. In-process research and development (\"IPR&D\") costs acquired in a business combination are recorded at fair value as an intangible asset at the acquisition date and amortized once the product is ready for sale or expensed if abandoned.\nRestructuring and Other Costs:\nGenerally, costs associated with an exit or disposal activity are recognized when the liability is incurred. Prior to recording restructuring charges for employee separation agreements, the Company notifies all employees of termination. Costs related to employee separation arrangements requiring future service beyond a specified minimum retention period are recognized over the service period.\nComprehensive Income:\nComprehensive income is defined as net income or loss and other changes in stockholders’ equity from transactions and other events from sources other than stockholders. Comprehensive income is reflected in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging:\nDerivatives are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. Accounting for gains or losses resulting from changes in the values of those derivatives depends on the use of the derivative instrument and whether it qualifies for hedge accounting.\nFor a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative’s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Cash flow hedges related to anticipated transactions are designated and documented at the inception of each hedge by matching the terms of the contract to the underlying transaction. The Company classifies the cash flows from hedging transactions in the same categories as the cash flows from the respective hedged items. Once established, cash flow hedges are generally recorded in other comprehensive income, unless an anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur, and subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Discontinued or dedesignated cash flow hedges are immediately settled with counterparties, and the related accumulated derivative gains or losses are recognized into net earnings on the consolidated financial statements. Settled cash flow hedges related to forecasted transactions that remain probable are recorded as a component of other comprehensive (loss) income and are subsequently amortized into net earnings when the hedged exposure affects net earnings. Forward contract effectiveness for cash flow hedges is calculated by comparing the fair value of the contract to the change in value of the anticipated transaction using forward rates on a monthly basis. The Company also has entered into other foreign currency forward contracts that are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. These contracts are recorded at fair value, with the changes in fair value recognized into interest and other expense, net on the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company also uses foreign currency denominated debt to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Realized and unrealized translation adjustments from these hedges are included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, as well as the offset translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold.\nLeases:\nOperating leases are included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in the Company's consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from\n51\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nthe lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities were recognized based on the present value of the remaining lease payments over the lease term. When the Company's lease did not provide an implicit rate, the Company used its incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. The Company used the implicit rate when readily determinable. The operating lease ROU asset excludes lease incentives. The lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as cars, the Company accounts for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, the Company applies a portfolio approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities.\nThe Company has made an accounting policy election not to recognize ROU assets and lease liabilities that arise from short-term leases for facilities and equipment. Instead, the Company recognizes the lease payments in the consolidated statements of operations on a straight-line basis over the lease term and variable lease payments in the period in which the obligation for those payments is incurred.\nAs a lessor, the Company applies the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from the associated lease component and instead accounts for those components as a single component if the non-lease components otherwise would be accounted for under ASC 606,\nRevenue From Contracts With Customers\n(“ASC 606”), and both of the following criteria are met: 1) the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease component or components and associated lease component are the same; and 2) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. If the non-lease component or components associated with the lease component are the predominant component of the combined component, the Company accounts for the combined component in accordance with ASC 606. Otherwise, the Company accounts for the combined component as an operating lease in accordance with ASC 842.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements:\nFrom time to time, new accounting pronouncements are issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (the \"FASB\") and are adopted by the Company as of the specified effective dates. Unless otherwise discussed, such pronouncements did not have or will not have a significant impact on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows or do not apply to the Company’s operations.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n(\"ASU 2019-12\"). ASU 2019-12 eliminates certain exceptions and adds guidance to reduce complexity in accounting for income taxes. Specifically, this guidance: (1) removes the intraperiod tax allocation exception to the incremental approach; (2) removes the ownership changes in investments exception in determining when a deferred tax liability is recognized after an investor in a foreign entity transitions to or from the equity method of accounting and applies this provision on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings at the beginning of the period of adoption; and (3) removes the exception to using the general methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period when a year-to-date loss exceeds the anticipated loss for the year. ASU 2019-12 also simplifies accounting principles by making other changes, including requiring an entity to: (1) evaluate whether a step-up in tax basis of goodwill relates to a business combination or a separate transaction; (2) make a policy election to not allocate consolidated income taxes when a member of a consolidated tax return is not subject to income tax and to apply this provision retrospectively to all periods presented; and (3) recognize a franchise tax (or similar tax) that is partially based on income as an income-based tax and apply this provision either retrospectively for all periods presented or on a modified retrospective basis through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the beginning of the period of adoption. The provisions of this guidance (except as specifically mentioned above) are to be applied prospectively upon their effective date.\nThe Company adopted the guidance beginning on January 4, 2021. The adoption did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNote 2:\nRevenue\nFor arrangements with multiple performance obligations, the Company accounts for individual products and services separately if they are distinct - i.e. if a product or service is separately identifiable from other items in the bundled package and if a customer can benefit from it on its own or with other resources that are readily available to the customer. The consideration (including any discounts) is allocated between separate products and services in a bundle based on their stand-alone selling prices. The stand-alone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells the products,\n52\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nextended warranties, and services. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates stand-alone selling prices by reference to the amount charged for similar items on a stand-alone basis.\nThe Company sells products and services predominantly through its direct sales force. As a result, the use of distributors is generally limited to geographic regions where the Company has no direct sales force. The Company does not offer product return or exchange rights (other than those relating to defective goods under warranty) or price protection allowances to its customers, including distributors. Payment terms granted to distributors are the same as those granted to end-customers and payments are not dependent upon the distributor's receipt of payment from their end-user customers.\nIn instances where the timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, the Company determined that the contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. The primary purpose of its invoicing terms is to provide customers with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing products and services, rather than to receive financing from the customers or to provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year software licenses or software subscriptions that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. In limited circumstances where the Company provides the customer with a significant benefit of financing, the Company uses the practical expedient and only adjusts the transaction price for the effects of the time value of money and only on contracts where the duration of financing is more than one year.\nNature of goods and services\nThe Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment of the Company principally generates revenue from sales of (a) instruments, consumables and services in the applied markets and (b) instruments, reagents, informatics, software, subscriptions, detection and imaging technologies, extended warranties, training and services in the life sciences market. The Diagnostics segment of the Company principally generates revenue from sales of instruments, solutions, consumables, reagents, extended warranties and services in the diagnostics market. Products and services may be sold separately or in bundled packages. The typical length of a contract for service is 12 to 36 months.\nThe revenue generated from the sale of instruments, consumables, reagents, and certain software is recognized at a point in time. The Company recognizes revenue in these arrangements at the point in time when control of the products has been transferred to customers, which is typically at delivery. Certain of the Company's products require specialized installation and configuration at the customer's site. Revenue for these products is deferred until installation is complete and customer acceptance has been received. When the Company places the instrument at the customer's site and sells the reagents to a customer, the instrument and reagents are accounted for together as one performance obligation. The Company does not charge a fee for the use of the instrument and retains ownership of the placed instrument. The Company has a right to remove the instrument and replace it with another instrument at the customer's site at any time throughout the contract term. The Company recognizes revenue upon delivery of reagents, which is the point in time where the Company has performed its obligation to provide a screening solution to the customer. Payment terms and conditions vary, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\nThe revenue generated from the sale of licenses for software as a service, cloud services, subscriptions, extended warranties, and laboratory services and training is recognized over time. Term licenses, subscriptions and cloud services, are generally recognized ratably over the contract period or based upon consumption. The Company sells its software subscriptions and cloud services with maintenance services and, in some cases, with consulting services. The Company recognizes revenue for the software commencing when the service is made available to the customer. For maintenance and consulting services, revenue is recognized ratably over the period in which the services are provided. Revenue for laboratory services is recognized over the contract period or at a point in time when the service is billable, based on time and materials. Payment terms and conditions vary, although terms generally include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days.\nDisaggregation of revenue\nIn the following tables, revenue is disaggregated by primary geographical market, end-markets and timing of revenue recognition.\n53\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nMajor Customer Concentration\nRevenues from one customer in the Company's Diagnostics segment represent approximately $\n638.6\nmillion, $\n97.8\nmillion\nand\n$\n30.8\nmillion\nof the Company's total revenue during the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nContract Balances\nContract assets:\nThe unbilled receivables (contract assets) primarily relate to the Company's right to consideration for work completed but not billed at the reporting date. The unbilled receivables are transferred to trade receivables when billed to customers. Contract assets are generally classified as current assets and are included in \"Accounts receivable, net\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nContract liabilities:\nThe contract liabilities primarily relate to the advance consideration received from customers for products and related installation for which transfer of control has not occurred at the balance sheet date. Contract liabilities are classified as either current in \"Accounts payable\" or \"Accrued expenses and other current liabilities\" or as long-term in \"Long-term liabilities\" in the consolidated balance sheets based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize revenue.\n54\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nContract costs:\nThe Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a customer as an asset if it expects the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. The Company determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial during the period and are included in other current and long-term assets on the consolidated balance sheets. The Company applies a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year or less.\nTransaction price allocated to the remaining performance obligations\nThe Company applies the practical expedient in ASC 606-10-50-14 and does not disclose information about remaining performance obligations that have original expected durations of one year or less. The estimated revenue expected to be recognized beyond one year in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the period are not material to the Company. The remaining performance obligations primarily include noncancelable purchase orders and noncancelable software subscriptions and cloud service contracts.\nNote 3:\nBusiness Combinations\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2021\nAcquisition of BioLegend, Inc.\nIn fiscal year 2021, t\nhe Company completed the acquisition of BioLegend, Inc. (\"BioLegend\") and paid an aggregate consideration\nof\n$\n5.7\nbillion, net of cash acquired of $\n292.4\nmillion, reflecting working capital and other adjustments (the \"Aggregate Consideration\"). The Aggregate Consideration was paid in a combination of $\n3.3\nbillion in cash and shares of the Company's common stock having a fair value of approximately $\n2.6\nbillion based on the $\n187.56\nper share closing price of the Company's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange on September 17, 2021 (the \"Stock Consideration\"). The Stock Consideration consisted of\n14,066,799\nshares of the Company's common stock.\nBioLegend is recognized as\na leading, global provider of life science antibodies and reagents headquartered in San Diego, California, with approximately\n700\nemployees.\nThe operations for this acquisition is reported within the results of\nthe Company's\nDiscovery & Analytical Solutions segment from the acquisition date. The excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the acquired net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforce acquired, and is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names, customer relationships and clone library, acquired as part of this acquisition had a weighted-average amortization period\nof\n16.3\nyears.\nBioLegend's revenue and net loss for the period from the acquisition date to January 2, 2022 were $\n91.7\nmillion and $\n25.8\nmillion, respectively. The net loss includes $\n47.0\nmillion of amortization of acquired intangible assets.\nThe following unaudited pro forma information presents the combined financial results for the Company and BioLegend as if the acquisition of BioLegend had been completed at the beginning of fiscal year 2020:\n55\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe unaudited pro forma information for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 have been calculated after applying the Company's accounting policies and the impact of acquisition date fair value adjustments. The fiscal year 2021 unaudited pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to exclude approximately $\n43.2\nmillion of acquisition-related transaction costs and $\n23.3\nmillion of costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges that were recognized in expense during the year. The fiscal year 2020 pro forma income from continuing operations was adjusted to include these acquisition-related transaction costs and the nonrecurring expenses related to the bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedging costs and fair value adjustments. These pro forma condensed consolidated financial results have been prepared for comparative purposes only and include certain adjustments, such as fair value adjustment to inventory, increased interest expense on debt obtained to finance the transaction, and increased amortization for the fair value of acquired intangible assets.\nThe pro forma information does not reflect the effect of costs or synergies that would have been expected to result from the integration of the acquisition. The pro forma information does not purport to be indicative of the results of operations that actually would have resulted had the combination occurred at the beginning of each period presented, or of future results of the consolidated entities. The actual results of operations may differ significantly from the pro forma amounts reflected herein due to a variety of factors.\nOther acquisitions in 2021.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company also completed the acquisition of seven other businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n1.2\nbillion. The acquired businesses include Oxford Immunotec Global PLC, a company based in Abingdon, UK with approximately\n275\nemployees, for total consideration of $\n590.9\nmillion and Nexcelom Bioscience Holdings, LLC, a company based in Lawrence, Massachusetts with approximately\n130\nemployees, for total consideration of $\n267.3\nmillion, and five other businesses, which were acquired for total consideration of $\n331.0\nmillion. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as employee workforces acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names, and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted-average amortization period of\n12.4\nyears\n.\n56\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2021 has been allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:\nThe Company does not consider the other acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2021 to be material to its consolidated results of operations; therefore, the Company is only presenting pro forma financial information of operations for the BioLegend acquisition. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for the other acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2021 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to January 2, 2022 were not material.\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2020\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of four businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n438.9\nmillion. The acquired businesses were Horizon Discovery Group plc (“Horizon”), a company based in Cambridge, UK with approximately\n400\nemployees, which was acquired on December 23, 2020 for a total consideration of $\n399.8\nmillion (£\n296.0\nmillion), and three other businesses which were acquired for a total consideration of $\n39.1\nmillion. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforces acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names, customer relationships and in-process research and development, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of\n11.0\nyears.\n57\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2020 has been allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:\nThe Company does not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2020 to be material to its consolidated results of operations. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2020 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to January 3, 2021 were not material.\nAcquisitions in fiscal year 2019\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company completed the acquisition of five businesses for aggregate consideration of $\n433.1\nmillion. The acquired businesses include Cisbio Bioassays SAS, a company based in Codolet, France, which was acquired for total consideration of $\n219.9\nmillion, Shandong Meizheng Bio-Tech Co., Ltd. (\"Meizheng Group\"), a company headquartered in Beijing, China, for total consideration of $\n166.5\nmillion, and three other businesses which were acquired for total consideration of $\n46.6\nmillion. The Company has a potential obligation to pay the former shareholders of certain of these acquired businesses additional contingent consideration of up to $\n31.8\nmillion. The excess of the purchase prices over the fair values of the acquired businesses' net assets represents cost and revenue synergies specific to the Company, as well as non-capitalizable intangible assets, such as the employee workforces acquired, and has been allocated to goodwill, which is not tax deductible. Identifiable definite-lived intangible assets, such as core technology, trade names and customer relationships, acquired as part of these acquisitions had a weighted average amortization period of\n11.0\nyears.\n58\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe total purchase price for the acquisitions in fiscal year 2019 has been allocated to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as follows:\nThe Company does not consider the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2019 to be material to its consolidated results of operations. The aggregate revenue and results of operations for the acquisitions completed during fiscal year 2019 for the period from their respective acquisition dates to\nDecember 29, 2019\nwere not material.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the allocations of purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal years 2020 and 2019 were considered final. The preliminary allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions completed in fiscal year 2021 were based upon initial valuations. The Company's estimates and assumptions underlying the initial valuations are subject to the collection of information necessary to complete its valuations within the measurement periods, which are up to\none year\nfrom the respective acquisition dates. The primary areas of the preliminary purchase price allocations that are not yet finalized relate to the fair value of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, assets and liabilities related to income taxes and related valuation allowances, and residual goodwill. The Company expects to continue to obtain information to assist in determining the fair values of the net assets acquired at the acquisition dates during the measurement periods. During the measurement periods, the Company will adjust assets or liabilities if new information is obtained about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates that, if known, would have resulted in the recognition of those assets and liabilities as of those dates. These adjustments will be made in the periods in which the amounts are determined and the cumulative effect of such adjustments will be calculated as if the adjustments had been completed as of the acquisition dates. All changes that do not qualify as adjustments made during the measurement periods are also included in current period earnings.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company obtained information relevant to determining the fair values of certain tangible and intangible assets acquired, and liabilities assumed, related to recent acquisitions and adjusted its purchase price allocations. The adjustments to the preliminary measurement were not material.\nThe allocations of the purchase prices for acquisitions are based on estimates of the fair value of the net assets acquired and are subject to adjustment upon finalization of the purchase price allocations. The accounting for business combinations requires estimates and judgments as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business, and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets, in determining the estimated fair values for assets acquired and liabilities assumed. The fair values assigned to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration, are based on management’s estimates and assumptions, as well as other information compiled by management, including valuations that utilize customary valuation procedures and techniques. Contingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date, based on the probability that revenue thresholds or product development milestones will be achieved during\n59\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nthe earnout period, with changes in the fair value after the acquisition date affecting earnings to the extent it is to be settled in cash. Increases or decreases in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities primarily result from changes in the estimated probabilities of achieving revenue thresholds or product development milestones during the earnout period.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods, of up to $\n108.4\nmillion. As of January 2, 2022, the Company has recorded contingent consideration obligations of $\n58.0\nmillion, of which $\n1.3\nmillion was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $\n56.7\nmillion was recorded in long-term liabilities. As of January 3, 2021, the Company had recorded contingent consideration obligations with an estimated fair value of $\n3.0\nmillion, of which $\n2.9\nmillion was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and $\n0.1\nmillion was recorded in long-term liabilities. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency periods does not exceed\n6.9\nyears from January 2, 2022, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at January 2, 2022 was\n5.4\nyears. If the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these fair values, the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill, require acceleration of the amortization expense of definite-lived intangible assets or the recognition of additional contingent consideration which would be recognized as a component of operating expenses from continuing operations.\nTotal acquisition and divestiture-related costs were $\n97.5\nmillion, $\n9.3\nmillion and $\n6.6\nmillion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. These amounts included $\n14.3\nmillion of incentive award associated with the Company's acquisition of Meizheng Group, $\n5.4\nmillion of net foreign exchange gain and $\n23.4\nmillion of costs of bridge financing and debt pre-issuance hedges related to the BioLegend acquisition in fiscal year 2021, $\n4.7\nmillion of incentive award associated with the Company's acquisition of Meizheng Group and $\n0.5\nmillion of acquisition-related interest expenses in fiscal year 2020, and  $\n2.6\nmillion of net foreign exchange loss related mainly to the Company's acquisition of Cisbio Bioassays SAS and $\n0.5\nmillion of compensation expense related to the acquisition of Tulip Diagnostics Private Limited in fiscal year 2019. These acquisition and divestiture-related costs were expensed as incurred and recorded in selling, general and administrative expenses and interest and other expense, net in the Company's consolidated statements of operations.\n60\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 4:        Restructuring and Other Costs, Net\nThe Company has undertaken a series of restructuring actions related to the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, the alignment of the Company's operations with its growth strategy, the integration of its business units and its productivity initiatives. The activities associated with these plans have been reported as restructuring and other costs, net, as applicable, and are included as a component of income from continuing operations. The current portion of restructuring and other costs is recorded in short-term accrued restructuring and other costs and accrued expenses and other current liabilities. The long-term portion of restructuring and other costs is recorded in operating lease liabilities and long-term liabilities.\nThe Company implemented restructuring plans in each quarter of fiscal year 2021 consisting of workforce reductions or closure of excess facility principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives and integrate new acquisitions (the \"Q1 2021 Plan\" and \"Q2 2021 Plan\", \"Q3 2021 Plan\", and \"Q4 2021 Plan\", respectively). The Company implemented a restructuring plan in the first quarter of fiscal year 2020 consisting of workforce reductions and closure of excess facilities principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (the \"Q1 2020 Plan\"). The Company implemented a restructuring plan in the third quarter of fiscal year 2020 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (\"Q3 2020 Plan\"). The Company implemented a restructuring plan in each quarter of fiscal year 2019 consisting of workforce reductions principally intended to realign resources to emphasize growth initiatives (the \"Q1 2019 Plan\", \"Q2 2019 Plan\", \"Q3 2019 Plan\" and \"Q4 2019 Plan\"). All other previous restructuring plans were workforce reductions or the closure of excess facility space principally intended to integrate the Company's businesses in order to realign operations, reduce costs, achieve operational efficiencies and shift resources into geographic regions and end markets that are more consistent with the Company's growth strategy (the \"Previous Plans\").\nThe following table summarizes the number of employees reduced, the initial restructuring or contract termination charges by operating segment, and the dates by which payments were substantially completed, or the expected dates by which payments will be substantially completed, for restructuring actions implemented during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 in continuing operations:\nThe Company expects to make payments under the Previous Plans for remaining residual lease obligations, with terms varying in length, through fiscal year 2022.\nThe Company has terminated various contractual commitments in connection with certain disposal activities and has recorded charges, to the extent applicable, for the costs of terminating these contracts before the end of their terms and the costs that will continue to be incurred for the remaining terms without economic benefit to the Company. The Company recorded additional pre-tax charges of $\n0.2\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion in the Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment during fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion in the Diagnostics segment during fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a result of these contract terminations.\n61\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe Company recorded pre-tax charges of $\n7.1\nmillion, $\n4.3\nmillion and $\n0.8\nmillion associated with relocating facilities during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company expects to make payments on these relocation activities through fiscal year 2022.\nAt January 2, 2022, the Company had $\n10.3\nmillion recorded for accrued restructuring and other costs, of which $\n8.0\nmillion was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, $\n0.7\nmillion was recorded in long-term liabilities and $\n1.6\nmillion was recorded as a reduction in operating lease right-of-use assets. At January 3, 2021, the Company had $\n8.3\nmillion recorded for accrued restructuring and other costs, of which $\n4.7\nmillion was recorded in short-term accrued restructuring and other costs, $\n2.0\nmillion was recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities and $\n1.6\nmillion was recorded as a reduction in operating lease right-of-use assets.\nNote 5:\nInterest and Other Expense, Net\nInterest and other expense, net, consisted of the following for the fiscal years ended:\n62\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 6:\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of income from continuing operations before income taxes were as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nThe components of the provision for income taxes on continuing operations were as follows:\nThe total provision for income taxes included in the consolidated financial statements is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nA reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the recorded tax provision is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\n63\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe variation in the Company's effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 is primarily affected by the recognition of $\n37.1\nmillion in U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. taxes due when the Company repatriates foreign earnings that it no longer considers indefinitely reinvested. The Company also recognized $\n19.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, $\n21.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 and $\n10.4\nmillion in fiscal year 2019 of benefits derived from tax holidays in China and Singapore. The effect of these benefits, derived from tax holidays, on basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year 2021 was $\n0.16\nand $\n0.16\n, respectively, for fiscal year 2020 was $\n0.20\nand $\n0.19\n, respectively, and for fiscal year 2019 was $\n0.09\nand $\n0.09\n, respectively. The tax holiday in China is renewed every three years. The Company expects to renew the tax holiday for two of the Company's subsidiaries in China that expired in fiscal year 2021. The tax holiday for one of the Company's subsidiaries in Singapore is scheduled to expire in fiscal year 2023.\nThe Company regularly reviews its tax positions in each significant taxing jurisdiction in the process of evaluating its unrecognized tax benefits. The Company makes adjustments to its unrecognized tax benefits when: (i) facts and circumstances regarding a tax position change, causing a change in management’s judgment regarding that tax position; (ii) a tax position is effectively settled with a tax authority at a differing amount; and/or (iii) the statute of limitations expires regarding a tax position.\nThe tabular reconciliation of the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nThe Company classifies interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense. At January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the Company had accrued interest and penalties of $\n7.6\nmillion and $\n5.8\nmillion, respectively. During fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company recognized a net expense of $\n1.8\nmillion, $\n1.8\nmillion and $\n1.6\nmillion, respectively, for interest\n64\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nand penalties in its total tax provision which includes settlements and statutes of limitations that had lapsed. At January 2, 2022, the Company had tax effected unrecognized tax benefits which, if recognized, $\n58.0\nmillion would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate and $\n1.7\nmillion would affect discontinued operations.\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that approximately $\n1.0\nmillion of its uncertain tax positions at January 2, 2022, including accrued interest and penalties, and net of tax benefits, may be resolved over the next twelve months as a result of lapses in applicable statutes of limitations and potential settlements. Various tax years after 2010 remain open to examination by certain jurisdictions in which the Company has significant business operations, such as China, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Singapore, the United Kingdom and the United States. The tax years under examination vary by jurisdiction.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company recorded net discrete income tax expense of $\n43.2\nmillion, which primarily consisted of $\n37.1\nmillion related to the assertions regarding reinvestment of foreign earnings, increase in unrecognized tax benefits of $\n1.9\nmillion, other adjustments of $\n3.9\nmillion and a discrete tax expense of $\n14.0\nmillion due to the remeasurement of United Kingdom deferred tax liabilities on long-lived purchase accounting intangibles and a $\n1.8\nmillion tax benefit related to other net United Kingdom deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection with United Kingdom Finance Act 2021, which increased the United Kingdom corporation tax from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. The remaining discrete tax benefit, excluding the United Kingdom rate change, related to excess tax benefits on stock compensation of $\n5.5\nmillion and $\n6.4\nmillion resulting from a transaction that was completed during the second quarter of fiscal year 2021.\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company recorded net discrete income tax expense of $\n10.8\nmillion, which primarily consisted of $\n15.2\nmillion assessment related to the consolidation of foreign entities in fiscal years 2019 and 2018. The Company filed an appeal for relief on this matter with the relevant foreign tax authority, but cannot be assured of a favorable outcome, and has therefore recorded the full impact in the tax provision. The Company also provided for interest on uncertain tax positions of $\n4.5\nmillion, foreign tax rate changes of $\n2.5\nmillion, return to provision adjustments of $\n1.2\nmillion and other tax matters of $\n1.6\nmillion, offset by recognition of excess tax benefits on stock compensation of $\n11.7\nmillion and a valuation allowance reversal of $\n2.5\nmillion.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Compan\ny recorded a net discrete income tax benefit of $\n23.4\nmillion which was primarily due to a valuation allowance reversal of $\n12.3\nmillion, recognition of excess tax benefits on stock compensation of $\n4.9\nmillion, return to provision adjustments of $\n6.7\nmillion and benefits from tax elections made during fiscal year 2019 of $\n3.7\nmillion, partially offset by a tax expense of $\n2.7\nmillion related to the one-time transition tax under the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (\"Tax Act\") and additional discrete expense of $\n1.4\nmillion expense related to other tax matters.\n65\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe tax effects of temporary differences and attributes that gave rise to deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nThe components of net deferred tax liabilities were recognized in the consolidated balance sheets as follows:\nAt January 2, 2022, for income tax return purposes, the Company had U.S. federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n74.8\nmillion, state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n10.8\nmillion, foreign net operating loss carryforwards of $\n452.0\nmillion, state tax credit carryforwards of $\n15.0\nmillion, general business tax credit carryforwards of $\n0.6\nmillion, and foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n0.1\nmillion. These losses begin to expire in 2022 without expiration for certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards and certain state credit carryforwards.\nValuation allowances take into consideration limitations imposed upon the use of the tax attributes and reduce the value of such items to the likely net realizable amount. The Company regularly evaluates positive and negative evidence available to determine if valuation allowances are required or if existing valuation allowances are no longer required. Valuation allowances have been provided on state net operating loss and state tax credit carryforwards and on certain foreign tax attributes that the Company has determined are not more likely than not to be realized. The decrease in the valuation allowance of $\n8.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to\nrelease of net operating loss carryforwards as a result of an audit settlement in Finland and utilization of carryforwards in Luxembourg, offset by an increase in China and other jurisdictions.\n66\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe components of net deferred tax liabilities were as follows:\nPrior to enactment of the Tax Act, the Company did not provide deferred income tax expense on the cumulative undistributed earnings of its international subsidiaries. The Tax Act required the Company to accrue a one-time transition tax on the unremitted earnings of its foreign subsidiaries. At December 31, 2017, the Company accrued for a one-time transition tax expense of $\n85.0\nmillion on its unremitted foreign earnings in accordance with the Tax Act. The U.S. Treasury subsequently issued regulations on the Tax Act and the Company recorded tax expense (benefit) of $\n2.7\nmillion and $(\n4.6\n) million during fiscal years 2019 and 2018, respectively.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the Company evaluated its undistributed foreign earnings and identified approximately $\n1.2\nbillion in earnings that it no longer considers indefinitely reinvested. The Company intends to begin repatriating such earnings to the U.S., in whole or in part, during fiscal year 2022. In doing so, the Company has recorded a provision of approximately $\n37.1\nmillion for the U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. taxes that would fall due when such earnings are repatriated. No additional income tax expense has been provided for any remaining undistributed foreign earnings, or any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely reinvested.\nNote 7:\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period less restricted unvested shares. Diluted earnings per share was computed by dividing net income by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding plus all potentially dilutive common stock equivalents, primarily shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options using the treasury stock method.\nThe following table reconciles the number of shares utilized in the earnings per share calculations for the fiscal years ended:\nAntidilutive securities include outstanding stock options with exercise prices and average unrecognized compensation cost in excess of the average fair market value of common stock for the related period. Antidilutive options were excluded from the calculation of diluted net income per share and could become dilutive in the future.\n67\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 8:\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net consisted of the following:\nReserves for credit losses consisted of the following:\n(1) Other amounts primarily relate to the impact of acquisitions, discontinued operations and foreign exchange movements.\nNote 9:\nInventories\nInventories consisted of the following:\nNote 10:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment consisted of the following:\nDepreciation expense on property, plant and equipment for the fiscal years ended January 2, 2022, January 3, 2021 and December 29, 2019 was $\n67.3\nmillion, $\n54.0\nmillion and $\n49.7\nmillion, respectively.\n68\nNote 11:\nMarketable Securities and Investments\nInvestments consisted of the following:\nMarketable securities.\nMarketable securities include equity and fixed-income securities. The net unrealized holding gain and loss on marketable securities, net of deferred income taxes, reported as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of stockholders' equity, was not material in fiscal years 2021 and 2020. The proceeds from the sales of securities and the related gains and losses are not material for any period presented.\nMarketable securities classified as available for sale consisted of the following:\nEquity investments.\nThe Company has equity interests in privately-held entities over which the Company neither has significant influence nor control.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 consisted of the following:\nThe amount of upward adjustments during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n19.6\nmillion, $\n0.04\nmillion and $\n8.2\nmillion, respectively. The cumulative amount of upward adjustments as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 was $\n27.8\nmillion and $\n8.2\nmillion, respectively. The amount of impairments and downward adjustments during fiscal year 2021 and fiscal year 2019 were $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n4.9\nmillion, respectively. The cumulative amount of impairments and downward adjustments as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 was $\n5.0\nmillion and $\n4.9\nmillion, respectively.\nNote 12:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets, Net\nThe Company tests goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually for possible impairment. Accordingly, the Company completes the annual testing of impairment for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on the later of\n69\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nJanuary 1 or the first day of each fiscal year. In addition to its annual test, the Company regularly evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that may indicate a potential impairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nThe process of testing goodwill for impairment involves the determination of the fair value of the applicable reporting units. The test consists of the comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting unit to determine if the carrying value exceeds the fair value. If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of goodwill. The Company performed its annual impairment testing for its reporting units as of\nJanuary 4, 2021\n, its annual impairment testing date for fiscal year 2021. The Company concluded based on the first step of the process that there was no goodwill impairment, and the fair value exceeded the carrying value by more than 20% for each reporting unit, except for the Company's Tulip reporting unit, which had a fair value that was between 10% and 20% more than its carrying value. While the Company believes that its estimates of current value are reasonable, if actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used, including such items as future cash flows and the volatility inherent in markets which the Company serves, impairment charges against the carrying value of those assets could be required in the future.\nIndefinite-lived intangibles are also subject to an annual impairment test. The Company consistently employed the relief from royalty model to estimate the current fair value when testing for impairment of indefinite-lived intangible asset. The impairment test consists of a comparison of the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset with its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess is recognized up to the amount of the amortizing intangible asset.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for fiscal years 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n70\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIdentifiable intangible asset balances at January 2, 2022 by category and segment were as follows:\n71\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nIdentifiable intangible asset balances at January 3, 2021 by category and segment were as follows:\nTotal amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets was $\n290.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, $\n192.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 and $\n164.3\nmillion in fiscal year 2019. Estimated amortization expense related to definite-lived intangible assets for each of the next five years is $\n413.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2022, $\n402.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2023, $\n391.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2024, $\n363.5\nmillion in fiscal year 2025, and $\n349.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2026.\n72\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nNote 13:\nDebt\nThe Company’s debt consisted of the following:\nSenior Unsecured Revolving Credit Facility.\nOn August 24, 2021, the Company terminated its previous senior unsecured revolving credit facility and entered into a new senior unsecured revolving credit facility with a five-year term and a borrowing capacity of $\n1.5\nbillion available through August 24, 2026. As of January 2, 2022, undrawn letters of credit in the aggregate amount of $\n11.0\nmillion were treated as issued and outstanding when calculating the borrowing availability under the facility. As of January 2, 2022, the Company had $\n1.49\nbillion available for additional borrowing under the facility. Borrowings will bear interest, payable quarterly or, if earlier, at the end of any interest period, at the Company's option at either (a) the base rate\n73\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\n(as defined in the credit agreement), or (b) the eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate), in each case plus a percentage spread based on the credit rating of the Company's debt. The base rate is the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus\n0.50\n%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its \"prime rate,\" and (c) the Eurocurrency Rate plus\n1.00\n%\n. T\nhe credit agreement for the new facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of default. The financial covenants include a debt-to-capital ratio that remains applicable for so long as the Company's debt is rated as investment grade. In the event that the Company's debt is not rated as investment grade, the debt-to-capital ratio covenant is replaced with leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio covenants.\nUnsecured Term Loan Credit Facility.\nThe Company ente\nred into an unsecured delayed draw term loan credit facility on August 11, 2021 that provided for\n$\n500.0\nmillion\nof term loans available through the earlier of (i) the consummation of\nthe Company's\nacquisition of BioLegend (with such transaction acquiring BioLegend being the “Acquisition”) and (ii) the date that is five (5) business days after October 25, 2021, and as could be extended through January 31, 2022 in the event that the outside date under the definitive agreement with respect to the Acquisition was extended. On September 16, 2021, the Company borrowed the full\n$\n500.0\nmillion\nfrom the term loan facility and used the proceeds to partially fund the Acquisition.\nThe interest rates under the senior unsecured term loan credit facility are at either (a) the base rate, as described in the credit agreement, or (b) the eurocurrency rate (a publicly published rate), in each case plus a percentage spread based on the credit rating of the Company’s debt. The base rate is the highest of (a) the Federal Funds Rate (as defined in the credit agreement) plus\n0.50\n%, (b) the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by Bank of America as its \"prime rate,\" and (c) the Eurocurrency Rate plus\n1.00\n%\n. The Eurocurrency margin as of January 2, 2022 was\n113.0\nbasis points. The weighted average Eurocurrency interest rate as of January 2, 2022 was\n0.10\n%, resulting in a weighted average effective Eurocurrency Rate, including the margin, of\n1.23\n%, which was the interest applicable to the borrowings outstanding as of January 2, 2022. The credit agreement for the facility contains customary affirmative, negative and financial covenants and events of defaults\nwhich are substantially similar to those contained in the senior unsecured revolving credit facility.\nSenior Unsecured Notes.\nOn September 10, 2021, the Company issued the following notes:\n•\n$\n500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n0.550\n% senior unsecured notes due in 2023 (the \"2023 Notes”),\n•\n$\n800.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n0.850\n% senior unsecured notes due in 2024 (the \"2024 Notes”),\n•\n$\n500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n1.900\n% senior unsecured notes due in 2028 (the \"2028 Notes”), and\n•\n$\n500.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n2.250\n% senior unsecured notes due in September 2031 (the \"September 2031 Notes”).\nOn March 8, 2021, the Company issued the following notes:\n•\n$\n400.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n2.550\n% senior unsecured notes due in March 2031 (the \"March 2031 Notes”), and\n•\n$\n400.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n3.625\n% senior unsecured notes due in 2051 (the \"2051 Notes”).\nInterest on each series of notes is payable semi-annually on March 15th and September 15th each year. The notes include optional redemption features, which allow the Company to redeem the notes, at the Company's option and subject to terms, conditions and limitations specified in the indentures governing the notes, at redemption prices set forth in the indentures governing the notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of redemption. Upon a change of control repurchase event (as defined in the indentures governing the notes) of the Company, the Company will, in certain circumstances, make an offer to repurchase the notes at a price equal to\n101\n% of their principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to, but excluding, the date of repurchase.\n74\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table summarizes the maturities of the Company’s indebtedness as of January 2, 2022:\nNote 14:\nAccrued Expenses and Other Current Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities consisted of the following:\nNote 15:\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nSavings Plan:\nThe Company has a 401(k) Savings Plan for the benefit of all qualified U.S. employees, with such employees receiving matching contributions in the amount equal to\n100.0\n% of the first\n5.0\n% of eligible compensation up to applicable Internal Revenue Service limits. Savings plan expense was $\n16.5\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, $\n14.1\nmillion in fiscal year 2020, and $\n13.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2019.\nPension Plans:\nThe Company has a defined benefit pension plan covering certain U.S. employees and non-U.S. pension plans for certain non-U.S. employees. The principal U.S. defined benefit pension plan was closed to new hires effective January 31, 2001, and benefits for those employed by the Company’s former Life Sciences business were frozen as of that date. Plan benefits were frozen as of March 2003 for those employed by the Company’s former Analytical Instruments business and corporate employees. Plan benefits were frozen as of January 31, 2011 for all remaining employees that were still actively\n75\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\naccruing in the plan. The plans provide benefits that are based on an employee’s years of service and compensation near retirement.\nNet periodic pension cost for U.S. and non-U.S. plans included the following components for fiscal years ended:\nThe Company recognizes actuarial gains and losses, unless an interim remeasurement is required, in the fourth quarter of the year in which the gains and losses occur. Such adjustments for gains and losses are primarily driven by events and circumstances beyond the Company's control, including changes in interest rates, the performance of the financial markets and mortality assumptions. Actuarial gains and losses, including other components of periodic pension cost, are recognized in the line item \"Interest and other expense, net\" in the consolidated statements of operations.\n76\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table sets forth the changes in the funded status of the principal U.S. pension plan and the principal non-U.S. pension plans and the amounts recognized in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021.\nActuarial assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost during the year were as follows:\n77\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following table provides a breakdown of the non-U.S. benefit obligations and fair value of assets for pension plans that have benefit obligations in excess of plan assets:\nAssets of the defined benefit pension plans are primarily equity and debt securities. Asset allocations as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, and target asset allocations for fiscal year 2022 are as follows:\nThe Company maintains target allocation percentages among various asset classes based on investment policies established for the pension plans which are designed to maximize the total rate of return (income and appreciation) after inflation within the limits of prudent risk taking, while providing for adequate near-term liquidity for benefit payments.\nThe Company’s expected rate of return on assets assumptions are derived from management’s estimates, as well as other information compiled by management, including studies that utilize customary procedures and techniques. The studies include a review of anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes and consideration of the appropriate asset allocation strategy given the anticipated requirements of the plans to determine the average rate of earnings expected on the funds invested to provide for the pension plans benefits. While the study gives appropriate consideration to recent fund performance and historical returns, the assumption is primarily a long-term, prospective rate.\nThe Company's discount rate assumptions are derived from a range of factors, including a yield curve for certain plans, composed of the rates of return on high-quality fixed-income corporate bonds available at the measurement date and the related expected duration for the obligations, and a bond matching approach for certain plans.\nThe target allocations for plan assets are listed in the above table. Equity securities primarily include investments in large-cap and mid-cap companies located in the United States and abroad, and equity index funds. Debt securities include corporate bonds of companies from diversified industries, high-yield bonds, and U.S. government securities. Other types of investments include investments in non-U.S. government index linked bonds, multi-strategy hedge funds and venture capital funds that follow several different strategies.\n78\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe fair value of the Company’s pension plan assets as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 by asset category, classified in the three levels of inputs described in Note 20 to the consolidated financial statements are as follows:\nValuation Techniques:\nValuation techniques utilized need to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. There have been no changes in the methodologies utilized at January 2, 2022 compared to January 3, 2021. The following is a description of the valuation techniques utilized to measure the fair value of the assets shown in the table above.\nEquity Securities:\nShares of registered investment companies that are publicly traded are categorized as Level 1 assets; they are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of the fund. These instruments have active markets.\n79\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nEquity index funds are mutual funds that are not publicly traded and are comprised primarily of underlying equity securities that are publicly traded on exchanges. Price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily observable and available. Equity index funds are categorized as Level 2 assets.\nFixed Income Securities:\nFixed income mutual funds that are publicly traded are valued at quoted market prices that represent the net asset value of securities held by the fund and are categorized as Level 1 assets.\nFixed income index funds that are not publicly traded are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments and are categorized as Level 2 assets.\nIndividual fixed income bonds are categorized as Level 2 assets except where sufficient quoted prices exist in active markets, in which case such securities are categorized as Level 1 assets. These securities are valued using third-party pricing services. These services may use, for example, model-based pricing methods that utilize observable market data as inputs. Broker dealer bids or quotes of securities with similar characteristics may also be used.\nOther Types of Investments:\nNon-U.S. government index link bond funds are not publicly traded and are stated at net asset value as determined by the issuer of the fund based on the fair value of the underlying investments. Underlying investments consist of bonds in which payment of income on the principal is related to a specific price index and are categorized as Level 2 assets.\nHedge funds, private equity funds, foreign real estate funds and venture capital funds are valued at fair value by using the net asset values provided by the investment managers and are updated, if necessary, using analytical procedures, appraisals, public market data and/or inquiry of the investment managers. The net asset values are determined based upon the fair values of the underlying investments in the funds. These other investments invest primarily in readily available marketable securities and allocate gains, losses, and expense to the investor based on the ownership percentage as described in the fund agreements. They are categorized as Level 3 assets.\nIn September 2021, the Company’s UK pension scheme executed a buy-in contract with Phoenix Life LTD (''Phoenix\"), under which the Company made an upfront payment to Phoenix in exchange for Phoenix agreeing to make the benefit payments under the Company’s UK pension scheme due to specified participants and their beneficiaries, thus transferring most of the investment and longevity risk associated with the covered participants and beneficiaries from the Company to Phoenix. This buy-in contract can be considered a liability-driven investment (''LDI\") solution that hedges not only the investment risk but also the longevity risk under the Company’s UK pension scheme.\nLike other LDI solutions, it does not eliminate ongoing administrative costs\n.\nThe Company's policy is to recognize significant transfers between levels at the actual date of the event.\n80\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 assets for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nWith respect to plans outside of the United States, the Company expects to contribute $\n7.0\nmillion in the aggregate during fiscal year 2022. During fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $\n6.9\nmillion, $\n7.5\nmillion and $\n8.2\nmillion in the aggregate, respectively, to pension plans outside of the United States. During fiscal year 2021, the Company contributed $\n20.0\nmillion to its defined benefit pension plan in the United States for the plan year 2019.\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service, as appropriate, are expected to be paid as follows:\nThe Company also sponsors a supplemental executive retirement plan to provide senior management with benefits in excess of normal pension benefits. Effective July 31, 2000, this plan was closed to new entrants. At January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, the projected benefit obligations were $\n24.1\nmillion and $\n25.9\nmillion, respectively. Assets with a fair value of $\n1.6\nmillion and $\n1.9\nmillion, segregated in a trust (which is included in marketable securities and investments on the consolidated balance sheets), were available to meet this obligation as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. Pension expenses and income for this plan netted to expense of $\n0.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, expense of $\n2.1\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 and expense of $\n4.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2019.\nPostretirement Medical Plans:\nThe Company provides healthcare benefits for eligible retired U.S. employees under a comprehensive major medical plan or under health maintenance organizations where available. Eligible U.S. employees qualify for retiree health benefits if they retire directly from the Company and have at least ten years of service. Generally, the major medical plan pays stated percentages of covered expenses after a deductible is met and takes into consideration payments by other group coverage and by Medicare. The plan requires retiree contributions under most circumstances and has provisions for cost-sharing charges. Effective January 1, 2000, this plan was closed to new hires. For employees retiring after 1991, the Company has capped its medical premium contribution based on employees’ years of service. The Company funds the amount allowable under a 401(h) provision in the Company’s defined benefit pension plan. Assets of the plan are primarily equity and\n81\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\ndebt securities and are available only to pay retiree health benefits. The costs of these plans are not material and the net assets in the plans totaled $\n20.7\nmillion and $\n19.0\nmillion at January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively.\nDeferred Compensation Plans:\nDuring fiscal year 1998, the Company implemented a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that provides benefits payable to officers and certain key employees or their designated beneficiaries at specified future dates, or upon retirement or death. The plan was amended to eliminate deferral elections, with the exception of Company 401(k) excess contributions for eligible participants, for plan years beginning January 1, 2011. Benefit payments under the plan are funded by contributions from participants, and for certain participants, contributions by the Company. The obligations related to the deferred compensation plan totaled $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n0.6\nmillion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively.\nNote 16:\nContingencies\nThe Company is conducting a number of environmental investigations and remedial actions at current and former locations of the Company and, along with other companies, has been named a potentially responsible party (“PRP”) for certain waste disposal sites. The Company accrues for environmental issues in the accounting period that the Company's responsibility is established and when the cost can be reasonably estimated. The Company has accrued $\n11.9\nmillion and $\n12.9\nmillion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively, in accrued expenses and other current liabilities, which represents its management’s estimate of the cost of the remediation of known environmental matters, and does not include any potential liability for related personal injury or property damage claims. The Company's environmental accrual is not discounted and does not reflect the recovery of any material amounts through insurance or indemnification arrangements. The cost estimates are subject to a number of variables, including the stage of the environmental investigations, the magnitude of the possible contamination, the nature of the potential remedies, possible joint and several liability, the time period over which remediation may occur, and the possible effects of changing laws and regulations. For sites where the Company has been named a PRP, management does not currently anticipate any additional liability to result from the inability of other significant named parties to contribute. The Company expects that the majority of such accrued amounts could be paid out over a period of up to\nten\nyears. As assessment and remediation activities progress at each individual site, these liabilities are reviewed and adjusted to reflect additional information as it becomes available. There have been no environmental problems to date that have had, or are expected to have, a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. While it is possible that a loss exceeding the amounts recorded in the consolidated financial statements may be incurred, the potential exposure is not expected to be materially different from those amounts recorded.\nThe Company is subject to various claims, legal proceedings and investigations covering a wide range of matters that arise in the ordinary course of its business activities. Although the Company has established accruals for potential losses that it believes are probable and reasonably estimable, in the opinion of the Company’s management, based on its review of the information available at this time, the total cost of resolving these contingencies at January 2, 2022 should not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. However, each of these matters is subject to uncertainties, and it is possible that some of these matters may be resolved unfavorably to the Company.\nNote 17:\nStock Plans\nStock-Based Compensation:\nThe Company’s 2019 Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”) authorizes the issuance of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock-based awards and cash awards as part of the Company’s compensation programs. The 2019 Plan replaced the Company’s 2009 Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”). Upon shareholder approval of the 2019 Plan,\n6.25\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock, as well as shares of the Company’s common stock previously granted under the 2009 Plan that expire, terminate or are otherwise surrendered, canceled, forfeited or repurchased by the Company at their original issuance price subject to a contractual repurchase right, became available for grant under the 2019 Plan. Awards granted under the 2009 Plan prior to its expiration remain outstanding. As part of the Company’s compensation programs, the Company also offers shares of its common stock under its Employee Stock Purchase Plan.\n82\nThe following table summarizes total pre-tax compensation expense recognized related to the Company’s stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance restricted stock units, performance units and stock grants, included in the Company’s consolidated statements of operations for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nThe total income tax benefit recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock-based compensation was $\n14.0\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, $\n17.2\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 and $\n11.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2019. Stock-based compensation costs capitalized as part of inventory were immaterial in all periods presented.\nStock Options:\nThe Company has granted options to purchase common shares at prices equal to the market price of the common shares on the date the option is granted. Conditions of vesting are determined at the time of grant. Options are generally exercisable in equal annual installments over a period of\nthree years\n, and will generally expire\nseven years\nafter the date of grant. Options replaced in association with business combination transactions are generally issued with the same terms of the respective plans under which they were originally issued.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value is then amortized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards, which is generally the vesting period. Use of a valuation model requires management to make certain assumptions with respect to selected model inputs. Expected volatility was calculated based on the historical and implied volatility of the Company’s stock. The average expected life was based on the contractual term of the option and historic exercise experience. The risk-free interest rate is based on United States Treasury zero-coupon issues with a remaining term equal to the expected life assumed at the date of grant.\nThe Company’s weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option pricing model were as follows for the fiscal years ended:\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022:\nThe aggregate intrinsic value for stock options outstanding at January 2, 2022 was $\n97.4\nmillion with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n5.1\nyears. The aggregate intrinsic value for stock options exercisable at January 2, 2022 was $\n50.1\nmillion with a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n3.0\nyears. At January 2, 2022, there were\n1.2\nmillion stock options that were vested and expected to vest in the future, with an aggregate intrinsic value of $\n97.4\nmillion and a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n5.1\nyears.\n83\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value of options granted during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n40.00\n, $\n18.98\n, and $\n22.63\nper share, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n32.4\nmillion, $\n51.1\nmillion, and $\n19.1\nmillion, respectively. Cash received from option exercises for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n25.1\nmillion, $\n37.7\nmillion, and $\n19.7\nmillion, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized related to the Company’s outstanding options was $\n6.3\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, $\n3.6\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 and $\n6.7\nmillion in fiscal year 2019.\nThere was $\n22.5\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted as of January 2, 2022. This cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2.5\nyears.\nRestricted Stock Awards:\nThe Company has awarded shares of restricted stock and restricted stock units to certain employees and non-employee directors at no cost to them, which cannot be sold, assigned, transferred or pledged during the restriction period. The restricted stock and restricted stock units vest through the passage of time, assuming continued employment. The fair value of the award at the time of the grant is expensed on a straight line basis primarily in selling, general and administrative expenses over the vesting period, which is generally\n3\nyears. Recipients of the restricted stock have the right to vote such shares and receive dividends.\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock award activity for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022:\nThe fair value of restricted stock awards vested during fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n11.6\nmillion, $\n14.0\nmillion, and $\n12.0\nmillion, respectively. The total compensation expense recognized related to the restricted stock awards was $\n18.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2021, $\n10.8\nmillion in fiscal year 2020 and $\n12.7\nmillion in fiscal year 2019.\nAs of January 2, 2022, there was $\n72.3\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost, related to nonvested restricted stock awards. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.9\nyears.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan:\nIn April 1999, the Company’s shareholders approved the 1998 Employee Stock Purchase Plan. In April 2005, the Compensation and Benefits Committee of the Company's Board of Directors (the \"Board\") voted to amend the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, effective July 1, 2005, whereby participating employees have the right to purchase common stock at a price equal to\n95\n% of the closing price on the last day of each six-month offering period. The number of shares which an employee may purchase, subject to certain aggregate limits, is determined by the employee’s voluntary contribution, which may not exceed\n10\n% of the employee’s base compensation. During fiscal year 2021, the Company issued\n21,578\nshares of common stock under the Company’s Employee Stock Purchase Plan at a weighted-average price of $\n168.11\nper share. During fiscal year 2020, the Company issued\n38,727\nshares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $\n105.23\nper share. During fiscal year 2019, the Company issued\n33,843\nshares under this plan at a weighted-average price of $\n82.25\nper share. At January 2, 2022 there remains available for sale to employees an aggregate of\n0.8\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock out of the\n5.0\nmillion shares authorized by shareholders for issuance under this plan.\n84\nNote 18:\nStockholders’ Equity\nComprehensive Income:\nThe components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income consisted of the following:\nDuring fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, pre-tax pension credit (cost) of $\n0.1\nmillion, $(\n1.8\n) million, and $\n0.8\nmillion, respectively, was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income into selling, general and administrative expenses as a component of net periodic pension cost.\nStock Repurchases:\nOn July 31, 2020, the Board authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock for an aggregate amount up to $\n250.0\nmillion under a stock repurchase program (the \"Repurchase Program\"). The Repurchase Program will expire on July 27, 2022 unless terminated earlier by the Board and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. During fiscal year 2021, the Company repurchased\n433,000\nshares of common stock under the Repurchase Program at an aggregate cost of $\n62.6\nmillion. As of January 2, 2022, $\n187.4\nmillion remained available for aggregate repurchases of shares under the Repurchase Program.\nIn addition, the Board has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of common stock to satisfy minimum statutory tax withholding obligations in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards and restricted stock unit awards granted pursuant to the Company’s equity incentive plans and to satisfy obligations related to the exercise of stock options made pursuant to the Company's equity incentive plans. During fiscal year 2021, the Company repurchased\n71,248\nshares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $\n10.5\nmillion. During fiscal year 2020, the Company repurchased\n72,251\nshares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $\n6.9\nmillion. During fiscal year 2019, the Company repurchased\n68,536\nshares of common stock for this purpose at an aggregate cost of $\n6.3\nmillion. The repurchased shares have been reflected as additional authorized but unissued shares, with the payments reflected in common stock and capital in excess of par value.\nDividends:\nThe Board declared a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.07\nper share in each quarter of fiscal years 2021 and 2020. At January 2, 2022, the Company had accrued $\n8.8\nmillion for a dividend declared in October 2021 for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021 that was paid in February 2022. On\nJanuary 27, 2022\n, the Company announced that the Board had declared a quarterly dividend of $\n0.07\nper share for the first quarter of fiscal year 2022 that will be payable in May 2022. In the future, the Board may determine to reduce or eliminate the Company’s common stock dividend in order to fund investments for growth, repurchase shares or conserve capital resources.\nNote 19:\nDerivatives and Hedging Activities\nThe Company uses derivative instruments as part of its risk management strategy only, and includes derivatives utilized as economic hedges that are not designated as hedging instruments. By nature, all financial instruments involve market and credit risks. The Company enters into derivative instruments with major investment grade financial institutions and has policies to monitor the credit risk of those counterparties. The Company does not enter into derivative contracts for trading or other speculative purposes, nor does the Company use leveraged financial instruments. Approximately\n60\n% of the Company’s\n85\nbusiness is conducted outside of the United States, generally in foreign currencies. As a result, fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates can increase the costs of financing, investing and operating the business.\nIn the ordinary course of business, the Company enters into foreign exchange contracts for periods consistent with its committed exposures to mitigate the effect of foreign currency movements on transactions denominated in foreign currencies. The intent of these economic hedges is to offset gains and losses that occur on the underlying exposures from these currencies, with gains and losses resulting from the forward currency contracts that hedge these exposures. Transactions covered by hedge contracts include intercompany and third-party receivables and payables. The contracts are primarily in European and Asian currencies, have maturities that do not exceed\n12\nmonths, have no cash requirements until maturity, and are recorded at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on the Company’s foreign currency contracts are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from operating activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nPrincipal hedged currencies include the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Euro, Indian Rupee, Singapore Dollar and Swedish Krona. The Company held forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as economic hedges, with U.S. dollar equivalent notional amounts totaling $\n371.9\nmillion at January 2, 2022, $\n808.0\nmillion at January 3, 2021, and $\n277.6\nmillion at December 29, 2019, and the fair value of these foreign currency derivative contracts was insignificant. The gains and losses realized on these foreign currency derivative contracts are not material. The duration of these contracts was generally\n30\ndays or less during each of fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIn addition, in connection with certain intercompany loan agreements utilized to finance its acquisitions and stock repurchase program, the Company enters into forward foreign exchange contracts intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to settlement of such intercompany loans denominated in foreign currencies. The Company records these hedges at fair value on the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. The unrealized gains and losses on these hedges, as well as the gains and losses associated with the remeasurement of the intercompany loans, are recognized immediately in interest and other expense, net. The cash flows related to the settlement of these hedges are included in cash flows from financing activities within the Company’s consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe outstanding forward exchange contracts designated as economic hedges, which were intended to hedge movements in foreign exchange rates prior to the settlement of certain intercompany loan agreements, included combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $\n360.2\nmillion as of January 2, 2022, combined Euro notional amounts of €\n33.4\nmillion and combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $\n499.0\nmillion as of January 3, 2021, and combined Euro notional amounts of €\n105.8\nmillion and combined U.S. Dollar notional amounts of $\n5.6\nmillion as of December 29, 2019. The net gains and losses on these derivatives, combined with the gains and losses on the remeasurement of the hedged intercompany loans were not material.\nDuring fiscal year 2018, the Company designated a portion of the 2026 Notes to hedge its investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. Unrealized translation adjustments from a portion of the 2026 Notes were included in the foreign currency translation component of AOCI, which offsets translation adjustments on the underlying net assets of foreign subsidiaries. The cumulative translation gains or losses will remain in AOCI until the foreign subsidiaries are liquidated or sold. As of January 2, 2022, the total notional amount of the 2026 Notes that was designated to hedge investments in foreign subsidiaries was €\n497.2\nmillion. The unrealized foreign exchange (gains) losses recorded in AOCI related to the net investment hedge were $(\n33.2\n) million, $\n49.6\nmillion and $(\n4.9\n) million during the fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2019, the Company entered into a cross-currency swap designated as a net investment hedge to hedge the Euro currency exposure of the Company’s net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries. This agreement is a contract to exchange fixed-rate payments in one currency for fixed-rate payments in another currency. Changes in the fair value of this swap are recorded in equity as a component of AOCI in the same manner as foreign currency translation adjustments. In assessing the effectiveness of this hedge, the Company uses a method based on changes in spot rates to measure the impact of the foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on both its foreign subsidiary net investment and the related swap. Under this method, changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument other than those due to changes in the spot rate are initially recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment, and then are amortized into other (income) expense, net in the consolidated statement of operations using a systematic and rational method over the instrument’s term. Changes in the fair value associated with the effective portion (i.e. those changes due to the spot rate) are recorded in AOCI as a translation adjustment and are released and recognized in earnings only upon the sale or liquidation of the hedged net investment. The cross-currency swap had an initial notional value of €\n197.4\nmillion or $\n220.0\nmillion and matured on November 15, 2021. Interest on the cross-currency swap was payable semi-annually, in Euro, on May 15th and November 15th of each year based on the Euro notional value and a fixed rate of\n2.47\n%. The Company received interest in U.S. dollars on May 15th and November 15th of each year based on the U.S. dollar equivalent of the Euro notional value and a fixed rate of\n5.00\n%.\n86\nDuring fiscal year 2020, the Company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge the 2021 Notes. The effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges were reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affected earnings. During the second quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company redeemed all of its outstanding 2021 Notes and settled the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges. The foreign exchange losses (gains) recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges were $\n9.5\nmillion and $(\n29.3\n) million d\nur\ning the fiscal years 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company entered into forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge a portion of the 2026 Notes. The effective portion of the gain or loss of the cash flow hedges will be reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. During the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2021, the Company settled the forward foreign exchange contracts that were designated as cash flow hedges. The foreign exchange loss recorded in earnings related to the cash flow hedges was $\n8.7\nmillion during  fiscal year 2021.\nDuring fiscal year 2021, the Company entered into two interest rate swaption agreements (together, the “Swaptions”) with expiration dates of September 30, 2021 in anticipation of issuing notes to fund the acquisition of BioLegend. The first Swaption had a term of 2 months and hedged an anticipated 10-year note offering, with a notional value of $\n500.0\nmillion. The second Swaption had a term of 2 months and hedged an anticipated 7-year note offering, with a notional value of $\n500.0\nmillion. The Company designated the Swaptions as qualifying hedging instruments and accounted for these derivatives as cash flow hedges. On September 8, 2021, the Company sold both Swaptions, and as a result, recognized a loss of $\n8.2\nmillion in interest and other expense, net during the fiscal year 2021. The Company also recorded other comprehensive income of $\n3.8\nmillion, which will be amortized to interest and other expense, net over the 7 and 10 year terms, respectively, of the related permanent financing.\nThe Company does\nno\nt expect any material net pre-tax gains or losses to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income into interest and other expense, net within the next twelve months.\nNote 20:\nFair Value Measurements\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash equivalents, derivatives, marketable securities and accounts receivable. The Company believes it had no significant concentrations of credit risk as of January 2, 2022.\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are primarily comprised of marketable securities, derivative contracts used to hedge the Company’s currency risk, and acquisition related contingent consideration. The Company has not elected to measure any additional financial instruments or other items at fair value.\nValuation Hierarchy:\nThe following summarizes the three levels of inputs required to measure fair value. For Level 1 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices as these instruments have active markets. For Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes quoted market prices in markets that are not active, broker or dealer quotations, or utilizes alternative pricing sources with reasonable levels of price transparency. For Level 3 inputs, the Company utilizes unobservable inputs based on the best information available, including estimates by management primarily based on information provided by third-party fund managers, independent brokerage firms and insurance companies. A financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. In determining fair value, the Company utilizes valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs to the extent possible.\nThe following tables show the assets and liabilities carried at fair value measured on a recurring basis as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021 classified in one of the three classifications described above:\n87\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nLevel 1 and Level 2 Valuation Techniques:\nThe Company’s Level 1 and Level 2 assets and liabilities are comprised of investments in equity and fixed-income securities as well as derivative contracts. For financial assets and liabilities that utilize Level 1 and Level 2 inputs, the Company utilizes both direct and indirect observable price quotes, including common stock price quotes, foreign exchange forward prices and bank price quotes. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 1 and Level 2 financial assets and liabilities.\nMarketable securities:\nInclude equity and fixed-income securities measured at fair value using the quoted market prices in active markets at the reporting date.\nForeign exchange derivative assets and liabilities:\nInclude foreign exchange derivative contracts that are valued using quoted forward foreign exchange prices at the reporting date. The Company’s foreign exchange derivative contracts are subject to master netting arrangements that allow the Company and its counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other. Derivative assets and liabilities that can be net settled under these arrangements have been presented in the Company's consolidated balance sheet on a net basis and are recorded in other assets. As of both January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, none of the master netting arrangements involved collateral.\nLevel 3 Valuation Techniques:\nThe Company’s Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration related to acquisitions. For liabilities that utilize Level 3 inputs, the Company uses significant unobservable inputs. Below is a summary of valuation techniques for Level 3 liabilities.\nContingent consideration:\nContingent consideration is measured at fair value at the acquisition date using projected milestone dates, discount rates, probabilities of success and projected revenues (for revenue-based considerations). Projected risk-adjusted contingent payments are discounted back to the current period using a discounted cash flow model.\nThe fair values of contingent consideration are calculated on a quarterly basis based on a collaborative effort of the Company’s regulatory, research and development, operations, finance and accounting groups, as appropriate. Potential valuation adjustments are made as additional information becomes available, including the progress towards achieving proof of concept, regulatory approvals and revenue targets as compared to initial projections, the impact of market competition and market landscape shifts from non-invasive prenatal testing products, with the impact of such adjustments being recorded in the consolidated statements of operations.\nAs of January 2, 2022, the Company may have to pay contingent consideration, related to acquisitions with open contingency periods that are substantially all revenue-based consideration, of up to $\n108.4\nmillion. The expected maximum earnout period for acquisitions with open contingency period does not exceed\n6.9\nyears from January 2, 2022, and the remaining weighted average expected earnout period at January 2, 2022\nwas\n5.4\nyears.\n88\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending Level 3 net liabilities for contingent consideration is as follows:\nThe carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value due to the short-term maturities of these assets and liabilities. If measured at fair value, cash and cash equivalents would be classified as Level 1.\nThe Company's outstanding senior unsecured notes had an aggregate fair value of $\n4,612.8\nmillion and aggregate carrying value of $\n4,479.5\nmillion as of January 2, 2022. The Company's outstanding senior unsecured notes had an aggregate fair value of $\n1,984.3\nmillion and aggregate carrying value of $\n1,811.5\nmillion as of January 3, 2021. The fair values of the outstanding senior unsecured notes were estimated using market quotes from brokers and were based on current rates offered for similar debt, which are Level 2 measurements.\nThe Company’s other debt facilities, including the Company's senior revolving credit facility and term loan facility, had an aggregate carrying value of $\n504.5\nmillion and $\n179.1\nmillion as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021, respectively. The carrying value approximates fair value and were classified as Level 2.\nNote 21:\nLeases\nLessee Disclosures\nThe Company leases certain property and equipment under operating and finance leases. The Company's leases have remaining lease terms of less than 1 year to 30 years, some of which include options to extend the lease for up to 5 years, and some of which include options to terminate the lease within 1 year. Finance leases are not material to the Company.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows:\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases was as follows:\n89\nS\nupplemental balance sheet information related to leases was as follows:\nLease costs from finance leases, short-term leases, variable lease costs and sub-lease income are not material.\n90\nFuture p\nayments of operating lease liabilities as of January 2, 2022 were as follows:\nLessor Disclosures\nCertain of the Company's contracts require that it place its instrument at the customer's site and sell reagents to the customer. As the predominant component in these contracts are the sales of reagents, the Company accounts for the combined component under ASC 606 only when both of the following criteria are met: 1) the timing and pattern of transfer of the non-lease component or components and associated lease component are the same; and 2) the lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an operating lease. When only one of the criteria is met, the Company accounts for the non-lease component under ASC 606 and the lease component under ASC 842. Profit or loss, interest income and aggregate net investment in sales-type leases that did not qualify for the practical expedient are not material to the Company.\nNote 22:\nIndustry Segment and Geographic Area Information\nThe Company discloses information about its operating segments based on the way that management organizes the segments within the Company for making operating decisions and assessing financial performance. The Company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on revenue and operating income. Intersegment revenue and transfers are not significant. The accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in Note 1.\nThe principal products and services of the Company's\ntwo\noperating segments are:\n•\nDiscovery & Analytical Solutions\n.  Provides products and services targeted towards the life sciences and applied markets.\n•\nDiagnostics\n.  Develops diagnostics, tools and applications focused on clinically-oriented customers, especially within the reproductive health, emerging market diagnostics and applied genomics markets. The Diagnostics segment serves the diagnostics market.\nThe Company has included the expenses for its corporate headquarters, such as legal, tax, audit, human resources, information technology, and other management and compliance costs, as well as the activity related to the mark-to-market adjustment on postretirement benefit plans, as “Corporate” below. The Company has a process to allocate and recharge expenses to the reportable segments when these costs are administered or paid by the corporate headquarters based on the extent to which the segment benefited from the expenses. These amounts have been calculated in a consistent manner and are included in the Company’s calculations of segment results to internally plan and assess the performance of each segment for all purposes, including determining the compensation of the business leaders for each of the Company’s operating segments.\n91\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nRevenue and operating income (loss) from continuing operations by operating segment are shown in the table below for the fiscal years ended:\n____________________________\n(1)\nLegal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements in the Company's Discovery & Analytical Solutions segment were $\n5.9\nmillion and $\n2.2\nmillion for fiscal years 2020 and 2019, respectively. Legal costs for significant litigation matters and settlements in the Company's Diagnostics segment were $\n0.1\nmillion, $\n1.2\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n(2)\nAsset impairment in the Company's Diagnostics segment was $\n3.9\nmillion and $\n7.9\nmillion for fiscal years 2021 and 2020.\n(3)\nCosts for significant environmental matters were $\n5.2\nmillion for fiscal year 2020. Stock compensation expense from acceleration of executive compensation was $\n7.7\nmillion for fiscal year 2019.\nAdditional information relating to the Company’s reporting segments is as follows for the three fiscal years ended January 2, 2022:\n92\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS — (Continued)\nThe following geographic area information for continuing operations includes revenue based on location of external customers for the three fiscal years ended January 2, 2022 and net long-lived assets based on physical location as of January 2, 2022 and January 3, 2021:\n(1) Long-lived assets consist of property and equipment, net, operating lease right-of-use assets, rental equipment, software and other long-term assets."

    "text": "Conclusion Regarding the Effectiveness of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 2, 2022. The term “disclosure controls and procedures” as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), means controls and other procedures of a company that are designed to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported, within the time periods specified in the Securities and Exchange Commission’s rules and forms. Disclosure controls\n93\nand procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company’s management, including its principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives, and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of January 2, 2022, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the reasonable assurance level.\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022, that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) or 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the company’s principal executive and principal financial officers and effected by the company’s board of directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\nPertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company;\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and\n•\nProvide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022. In making this assessment, our management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in the 2013 Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Our assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting excluded the internal co\nntrols of Oxford Immunotec Global PLC, Nexcelom Bioscience Holdings, LLC, Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings PLC, SIRION Biotech GmbH,\nOptimization Zorn Corporation, BioLegend, Inc. and Qognit, Inc., all of which were acquired during the fiscal year ended\nJanuary 2, 2022\n, which were included in our fiscal year 2021 consolidated financial st\natements and represented approximately 4% of our total assets (exclusive of acquired intangible assets and goodwill) as of January 2, 2022 and 4% of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended January 2, 2022.\nBased on this assessment, our management concluded that, as of January 2, 2022, our internal control over financial reporting was effective based on those criteria.\nOur registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting. This report appears below.\n94\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of PerkinElmer, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of PerkinElmer, Inc. and sub\nsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 2, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022 of the Company and our report dated\nMarch 3, 2022\nexpressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded from its assessment the internal control over financial reporting at Oxford Immunotec Global PLC, Nexcelom Bioscience Holdings, LLC, Immunodiagnostic Systems Holdings PLC, SIRION Biotech GmbH, Optimization Zorn Corporation, BioLegend, Inc. and Qognit, Inc. (collectively “the Acquired Entities”), all of which were acquired during the year ended January 2, 2022 and whose financial statements constitute approximately 4% of total assets (exclusive of acquired intangible assets and goodwill)  and 4% of total revenues of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended January 2, 2022. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting of the Acquired Entities.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s / DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nBoston, Massachusetts\nMarch 3, 2022\n95\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended January 2, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that many of our employees are working remotely due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We are continually monitoring and assessing the effect of the COVID-19 situation on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness."
