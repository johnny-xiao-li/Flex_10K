Stryker offers innovative products and services in Medical and Surgical, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes.\nOur core values guide our behaviors and actions and are fundamental to how we execute our mission.\nStryker was incorporated in Michigan in 1946 as the successor company to a business founded in 1941 by Dr. Homer H. Stryker, a prominent orthopaedic surgeon and the inventor of several medical products. Our products are sold in over 75 countries through company-owned subsidiaries and branches, as well as, third-party dealers and distributors, and include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical and neurovascular devices; implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted technology; spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties. In the United States most of our products are marketed directly to doctors, hospitals and other healthcare facilities.\nAs used herein, and except where the context otherwise requires, \"Stryker,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" and \"our\" refer to Stryker Corporation and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBusiness Segments and Geographic Information\nEffective December 31, 2021 we changed our reportable business segments to (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine to align to our new internal reporting structure. We have reflected this change in all historical periods presented. Financial information regarding our reportable business segments and certain geographic information is included under \"Consolidated Results of Operations\" in Item 7 of this report and Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology\nMedSurg products include surgical equipment, patient and caregiver safety technologies, and navigation systems\n(Instruments), endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products (Medical), reprocessed and remanufactured medical devices, and other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Neurotechnology includes neurosurgical, neurovascular and craniomaxillofacial implant products. Our neurotechnology offering includes products used for minimally invasive endovascular procedures; a comprehensive line of products for traditional brain and open skull based surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral augmentation products (Neuro Cranial); and minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (Neurovascular). The craniomaxillofacial implant offering includes cranial, maxillofacial, and chest wall devices, as well as, dural substitutes and sealants.\nWe are one of five leading global competitors in Instruments; the other four being Zimmer Biomet Holdings, Inc. (Zimmer), Medtronic plc., Johnson & Johnson and ConMed Linvatec, Inc. (a subsidiary of CONMED Corporation). In Endoscopy we compete with Karl Storz GmbH & Co., Olympus Optical Co. Ltd., Smith & Nephew plc (Smith & Nephew), ConMed Linvatec, Arthrex, Inc. and STERIS plc. In Medical our primary competitors are Baxter/Hill-Rom, Inc., Zoll Medical Corporation, Medline Industries and Ferno-Washington, Inc. Stryker is also one of five leading global competitors in Neurotechnology; the other four being Medtronic, Johnson & Johnson, Terumo Corporation and Penumbra, Inc.\nIn 2021 Instruments launched a T7 helmet with increased comfort and disposables in orthopaedic instruments, and had strong second year sales of TPX next generation corded power tools for conducting small bone orthopaedic procedures. Endoscopy launched the SLX surgical light portfolio to improve safety in the operating room through customized lighting. In addition, Endoscopy launched the InSpace balloon, the industry’s first balloon implant for arthroscopic treatment of massive, irreparable rotator cuff tears (MIRCTs). Medical increased penetration and focus in their broad portfolio with significant investment in their specialized sales forces.\nIn 2021 we furthered our expansion into the global flow diversion market with the continued launch of the next generation Surpass Evolve™ Flow Diverter in the United States and Brazil, as well as the Surpass Streamline™ Flow Diverter in China and Japan. Also in 2021 we continued the launches of the Trevo NXT and Vecta Aspiration Catheter families, as well as the next generation of the market leading Synchro guidewire in multiple regions of the world.\nOrthopaedics and Spine\nOrthopaedics products consist primarily of implants used in total joint replacements, such as hip, knee and shoulder, and trauma and extremities surgeries. We bring patients and physicians advanced implant designs and specialized instrumentation that make orthopaedic surgery and recovery simpler, faster and more effective. We support surgeons with the technology and services they need as they develop new surgical techniques. The Mako\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nRobotic-Arm Assisted Surgical System was designed to help surgeons provide patients with a personalized surgical experience based on their specific diagnosis and anatomy. The Mako System currently offers three applications supporting Partial Knee, Total Hip and Total Knee procedures. Mako is the only robotic-arm assisted technology enabled by 3D CT-based pre-operative planning and, with AccuStop™ haptic technology, Mako provides surgeons the ability to know more about their patients' anatomy so they can cut less in bone preparation and implant placement with intra-operative haptic guidance.\nOur spinal implant offering includes cervical and thoracolumbar systems that include fixation, minimally invasive and interbody systems used in spinal injury, complex spine and degenerative therapies. Our spine enabling technologies portfolio includes best in class imaging solutions, image-guided surgical technology, patient specific implants and digital health solutions supporting surgeons and their patients throughout the continuum of care.\nWe are one of four leading global competitors for joint replacement and trauma and extremities products and robotics; the other three being Zimmer, DePuy Synthes (a Johnson & Johnson company) and Smith & Nephew. We are one of five leading global competitors in Spine; the other four being Medtronic Sofamor Danek, Inc. (a subsidiary of Medtronic), DePuy Synthes, Nuvasive, Inc. and Globus Medical, Inc.\nIn 2021 we moved to full commercial launch in the United States, and first clinical use in the European Union and Canada, of the new Tornier Perform Humeral™ shoulder implant system for anatomic and reverse shoulder arthroplasty. United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval was received in 2020, Health Canada approval was received in the first quarter of 2021 and European Union approval is expected in early 2022.\nRaw Materials and Inventory\nRaw materials essential to our business are generally readily available from multiple sources; however, certain of our raw materials are currently sourced from single suppliers. Substantially all products we manufacture are stocked in inventory, while certain MedSurg products are assembled to order. Where some electronic components have had limited availability due to current global shortages, we have worked closely with suppliers to ensure this temporary supply constraint did not have a material adverse effect on continuity of supply.\nPatents and Trademarks\nPatents and trademarks are significant to our business to the extent that a product or an attribute of a product represents a unique design or process. Patent protection of such products restricts competitors from duplicating these unique designs and features. We seek to obtain patent protection on our products whenever appropriate for protecting our competitive advantage. On December 31, 2021 we owned approximately 4,458 United States patents and approximately 7,199 patents in other countries.\nSeasonality\nOur business is generally not seasonal in nature; however, the number of orthopaedic implant surgeries is typically lower in the summer months, and sales of capital equipment are generally\nhigher in the fourth quarter. The dollar amount of customer backlog orders at any given time is not meaningful to an understanding of our business taken as a whole.\nCompetition\nIn each of our product lines we compete with local and global companies. The development of new and innovative products is important to our success in all areas of our business. Competition in research involving the development and improvement of new and existing products and processes is particularly significant. The competitive environment requires substantial investments in continuing research and maintaining sales forces.\nWe believe our commitment to innovation, quality and service and our reputation differentiates us in the highly competitive product categories in which we operate and enables us to compete effectively. We believe that our competitive position in the future will depend to a large degree on our ability to develop new products and make improvements to existing products.\nRegulation\nOur businesses are subject to varying degrees of governmental regulation in the countries in which we operate, and the general trend is toward increasingly stringent regulation.\nIn the United States the Medical Device Amendments of 1976 to the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act and its subsequent amendments and the regulations issued and proposed thereunder provide for regulation by the FDA of the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, including most of our products. Many of our new products fall into FDA classifications that require notification submitted as a 510(k) and review by the FDA before we begin marketing them. Certain of our products require extensive clinical testing, consisting of safety and efficacy studies, followed by pre-market approval (PMA) applications for specific surgical indications. Certain of our products also fall under other FDA classifications, such as drugs and Human Cells, Tissues, and Cellular and Tissue-Based Products.\nThe FDA's Quality System regulations set forth standards for our product design and manufacturing processes, require the maintenance of certain records and provide for inspections of our facilities by the FDA. There are also certain requirements of state, local and foreign governments that must be complied with in the manufacture and marketing of our products.\nThe European Union enacted the European Union Medical Device Regulation in May 2017 with an effective date of May 2021, which imposes stricter requirements for the marketing and sale of medical devices, including in the areas of clinical evaluation requirements, quality systems, labeling and post-market surveillance. Additionally, as a result of the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union (Brexit), new medical device regulations were released by the United Kingdom, which became effective January 1, 2021. A gap analysis against the prior Medical Device Directive (MDD) and a compliance plan are being implemented for both the European Union and United Kingdom regulations to ensure compliance and minimize business disruption. Finally, we are required to comply with the unique regulatory requirements of each country within which we market and sell our products. For example, China's National Medical Products Administration (NMPA) has recently promulgated more stringent regulatory requirements.\nInitiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nprice regulation and competitive pricing. It is not possible to predict at this time the long-term impact of such cost containment measures on our future business. In addition, business practices in the healthcare industry are scrutinized, particularly in the United States, by federal and state government agencies. The resulting investigations and prosecutions carry the risk of significant civil and criminal penalties.\nEnvironment\nWe are subject to various rules and regulation in the United States and internationally related to the protection of human health and the environment. Our operations involve the use of substances regulated under environmental laws, primarily in manufacturing and sterilization processes. We believe our policies, practices and procedures are properly designed to comply, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. We do not expect compliance with these requirements to have a material effect on purchases of property, plant and equipment, cash flows, net earnings or competitive position.\nEmployees\nOn December 31, 2021 we had approximately 46,000 employees globally, with approximately 25,000 employees in the United States. Our talented employees are an integral reason for our standing as one of the world's leading medical technology companies where, together with our customers, we are driven to make healthcare better. Our company values of integrity, accountability, people and performance are a key component of that mission. Our people, as one of our core values, continue to be a key focus.\nOur success is dependent on our ability to attract the best talent that reflects our diverse communities. To do so, we continue to focus on the basics of creating a great workplace. We believe in attracting the right people, maintaining and building employee engagement and developing our employees. We believe when people are able to do what they do best, they will look forward to coming to work and, in turn, will deliver great business results. Stryker is made up of hardworking, results-oriented people who are driven to go above and beyond for our customers.\nOur leadership team and Board of Directors receive regular updates on our people and culture strategy and provide feedback on our strategy and goals, including alignment to mission and values, peer benchmarking and stakeholder feedback.\nEmployee Development\nOur employee development is extensive and exists at all levels of the organization, including company-wide training on our Code of Conduct, job-related technical training and management and leadership training. Our development programs include on-the-job learning, coaching and mentoring, management and leadership development courses, team building and collaboration training and immersive experiences with expert partners.\nWe encourage all employees to establish individual development plans, in partnership with their manager, to help employees gain the needed development experience to grow their careers.\nEmployee Engagement\nAn engaged workplace culture that drives performance and business outcomes is central to our mission. Listening to and learning from our employees forms the foundation of an engaging culture. More than 90% of our global employees participate in our annual engagement survey, which provides a valued platform for listening and allows us to take action based on the feedback collected.\nWe supplement our annual engagement survey with targeted pulse surveys to gather feedback on topics relevant to the current climate. Additionally, we establish forums for collecting qualitative feedback to gain insights and identify actions we can take to ensure all employees feel included, engaged and able to achieve their full potential.\nWe also provide tools and resources that enable managers and teams to act on the insights we gain from our surveys and to drive employee engagement and strong business outcomes.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion (DE&I)\nAn essential part of our culture is respecting each individual’s strengths and values. Building on this foundation, we are focused on maintaining an inclusive, engaging work environment and prioritizing DE&I in keeping with our values of integrity and people. Our DE&I strategy is centered around these three commitments:\n•\nStrengthen the diversity of our workforce\n•\nAdvance a culture of inclusion, engagement and belonging\n•\nMaximize the power of inclusion to drive innovation and growth\nWe are advancing our commitments through the following actions, among others:\n•\nHolding leadership accountable through transparent data, performance objectives and inclusion in our business review process\n•\nEngaging and inspiring all talent and empowering every employee to take action\n•\nDeveloping our people and processes by removing barriers and optimizing the power of diverse backgrounds, talents and perspectives\n•\nAttracting a diverse talent pool through focused outreach and ensuring an objective hiring process\n•\nAdvancing our employee resource groups (ERGs) to expand reach through executive leadership, global presence, funding and aligned strategies\n•\nPositively impacting our customers and communities through building and strengthening external partnerships\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 36.6% of our global employees were women and 26.0% of our employees in the United States identified as racially or ethnically diverse.\nAttracting and Hiring\nWe understand that every employee drives our success. We focus on attracting, identifying and selecting strong candidates who will be successful at Stryker and ensuring that each person we hire brings the talent, expertise and passion we need to continue to be successful.\nHealth and Safety\nEnsuring our employees' safety is a top priority. It is a responsibility that we share throughout the company and one that has evolved to meet the needs of our workforce during the pandemic. Employees' safety risks vary depending on the roles they perform, so we tailor our safety efforts accordingly.\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nOur compensation and benefits programs are designed to attract and retain top talent and to incentivize performance and alignment to our mission and values.\nWe offer market-competitive base pay and benefits to our employees in countries around the world. We regularly evaluate our compensation and benefit offerings and levels, using\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nrecognized outside consulting firms to ensure fairness and competitiveness in our offerings.\nMost of our employees also have variable components to their compensation packages that reward employees based on individual, business unit and/or company-wide performance.\nOur proxy statement provides more detail on the competitive compensation programs we offer.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nEach of our executive officers was elected by our Board of Directors to serve in the office indicated until the first meeting of the Board of Directors following the annual meeting of shareholders in 2022 or until a successor is chosen and qualified or until his or her resignation or removal. Each of our executive officers held the position above or served Stryker in various executive or administrative capacities for at least five years, except for Mr. Fletcher and Mr. Menon. Prior to joining Stryker in April 2019, Mr. Fletcher held various legal leadership roles with Johnson & Johnson for the previous 14 years, most recently as the Worldwide Vice President, Litigation. Prior to joining Stryker in April 2018, Mr. Menon held various senior supply chain leadership roles with Verizon Communications Inc. during the previous eight years, most recently as the Chief Supply Chain Officer.\nAvailable Information\nOur main corporate website address is\nwww.stryker.com.\nCopies of our filings with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are available free of charge on our website within the \"Investors Relations\" section as soon as reasonably practicable after having been electronically filed or furnished to the SEC.

    "text": "This report contains statements that are not historical facts and are considered \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These statements are based on current projections about operations, industry conditions, financial condition and liquidity. Words that identify forward-looking statements include words such as \"may,\" \"could,\" \"will,\" \"should,\" \"possible,\" \"plan,\" \"predict,\" \"forecast,\" \"potential,\" \"anticipate,\" \"estimate,\" \"expect,\" \"project,\" \"intend,\" \"believe,\" \"may impact,\" \"on track,\" \"goal,\" \"strategy\" and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance, an acquisition or our businesses. In addition, any statements that\nrefer to expectations, projections or other characterizations of future events or circumstances, including any underlying assumptions, are forward-looking statements. Those statements are not guarantees and are subject to risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual results could differ materially and adversely from these forward-looking statements. Some important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from our expectations in any forward-looking statements include the risks discussed below.\nOur operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties discussed below that could materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem not to be material may also materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC RISKS\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has materially adversely affected, and could continue to materially adversely affect, our operations, supply chain, manufacturing, product distribution, customers and other business activities:\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the United States and international economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. In response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented, and may continue to implement, numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. A significant number of our customers, global suppliers, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic and those operations have been, and could continue to be, materially affected by restrictive measures implemented in response to the pandemic. As a result, some of our customers, distributors and indirect sales channels have at times been unable to retain employees, distribute or use our products or provide required services. Any delay or shortage in the supply of components or materials or delay in delivering our products may result in our inability to satisfy consumer demand for our products in a timely manner or at\nall, which could harm our reputation, future sales and profitability. For example, certain of our products contain electronic components and we have experienced, and could continue to experience, limited product availability due to the electronic components shortage in certain product lines. If the shortage persists, we may not be able to obtain electronic components from our suppliers on a timely basis, or at all, or identify any alternative suppliers to provide the electronic components we need to produce our products.\nIn addition, the pandemic could adversely impact our ability, and the ability of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, to retain key employees and ensure the continued service and availability of skilled personnel necessary to run our, and their, complex operations. To the extent our management or other personnel, or the management or other personnel of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers, are impacted in significant numbers by the pandemic and are not available to perform their job duties, we could experience delays in, or the suspension of, our manufacturing operations, sales activities, research and product development activities, regulatory work streams, clinical development programs and other important commercial and corporate functions.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nMoreover, the actions we take to mitigate the effect of the pandemic on our workforce could reduce the efficiency of our operations or prove insufficient. Our relationships with our employees may be disrupted due to measures implemented in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. We have observed an overall tightening and increasingly competitive labor market due to labor shortages caused in part by the COVID-19 pandemic and responsive measures, which has included increased wages offered by other employers and voluntary attrition of our employees and the employees of our third-party suppliers, manufacturers, distributors and customers.\nThe extent of the pandemic’s effect on our business and industry will depend on future developments, including the duration, spread and intensity of the pandemic, including future resurgences and/or the spread of variants, and the successful development, distribution and acceptance of vaccines for COVID-19, all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict. We are not able at this time to estimate with certainty the effect of these and other unforeseen factors on our business, but the adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations has been, and could in the future be, material. A prolonged impact of COVID-19 also could heighten many of the other risks described in this report.\nWe have experienced, and may continue to experience, a significant and unpredictable need to adjust our operations as market demand for certain of our products has shifted and continues to shift or as may be mandated by governmental authorities in response to the COVID-19 pandemic:\nSome of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. Elective medical procedures were suspended or reduced at various times in 2020 and 2021 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. It is not possible to predict whether elective medical procedures will again be suspended or reduced in the future and, to the extent individuals and customers are required to continue to de-prioritize, delay or cancel elective procedures as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively affected.\nIn addition, our products in certain divisions, such as Medical, have experienced, and could continue to experience, higher demand as our customers focus on treating COVID-19 patients. Unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products have exceeded in the past, and could exceed in the future, our capacity to meet such demand timely, which could adversely affect our customer relationships and result in negative publicity. In this regard, the accelerated development and production of products and services in an effort to address medical and other requirements as a result of the pandemic could increase the risk of regulatory enforcement actions, product defects or related claims.\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nCurrent economic and political conditions make tax rules in jurisdictions subject to significant change\n:\nOur future results of operations could be affected by changes in the effective tax rate as a result of changes in tax laws, regulations and judicial rulings. We are continuing to evaluate the impact of tax reform in the countries in which we operate as new guidance and regulations are published. In addition, further changes in the tax laws could arise, including as a result of the base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) project undertaken by the Organisation for\nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD). The OECD, which represents a coalition of member countries, has issued recommendations that, in some cases, would make substantial changes to numerous long-standing tax positions and principles. These contemplated changes, to the extent adopted by OECD members and/or other countries, could increase tax uncertainty and may adversely affect our provision for income taxes.\nWe could be negatively impacted by future changes in the allocation of income to each of the income tax\njurisdictions in which we operate:\nWe operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both in the United States and internationally. Accordingly, our management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each jurisdiction based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax authorities regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments.\nThe impact of United States healthcare reform legislation on our business remains uncertain:\nIn 2010 the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA) was enacted. While the provisions of the ACA are intended to expand access to health insurance coverage and improve the quality of healthcare over time, other provisions of the legislation, including Medicare provisions aimed at decreasing costs, comparative effectiveness research, an independent payment advisory board and pilot programs to evaluate alternative payment methodologies, are having a meaningful effect on the way healthcare is developed and delivered and could have a significant effect on our business. There have been ongoing litigation and congressional efforts to modify or repeal all or certain provisions of the ACA. We face uncertainties that might result from modification or repeal of any of the provisions of the ACA, including as a result of current and future executive orders and legislative actions. We cannot predict what other healthcare programs and regulations will ultimately be implemented at the federal or state level or the effect that any future legislation or regulation in the United States may have on our business.\nWe are subject to extensive governmental regulation relating to the classification, manufacturing, sterilization, labeling, marketing and sale of our products:\nThe classification, manufacturing, sterilization, labeling, marketing and sale of our products are subject to extensive and evolving regulations and rigorous regulatory enforcement by the FDA, European Union, the NMPA in China, and other governmental authorities in the United States and internationally. The process of obtaining regulatory clearances and/or approvals to market and sell our products can be costly and time consuming and the clearances and/or approvals might not be granted timely. We have ongoing responsibilities under the laws and regulations applicable to the manufacturing of products within our facilities and those contracted by third parties that are subject to periodic inspections by the FDA and other governmental authorities to determine compliance with the quality system, medical device reporting regulations and other requirements. Costs to comply with regulations, including the European Union Medical Device Regulation enacted by the European Union in May 2017 and effective in May 2021, the free trade agreement between the United Kingdom and the European Union that became effective January 1, 2021, and the regulatory laws established by the NMPA in China, and costs associated with remediation can be significant. If we fail to comply with applicable regulatory\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nrequirements, we may be subject to a range of sanctions, including substantial fines, warning letters that require corrective action, product seizures, recalls, the suspension of product manufacturing, revocation of approvals, exclusion from future participation in government healthcare programs, substantial fines and criminal prosecution.\nWe are subject to federal, state and foreign healthcare regulations, including anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-kickback and false claims laws, globally and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws:\nThe relationships that we, and third-parties that market and/or sell our products, have with healthcare professionals, such as physicians, hospitals, healthcare organizations and others, are subject to scrutiny under various state and federal laws often referred to collectively as healthcare fraud and abuse laws. In addition, the United States and foreign government regulators have increased the enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) and other anti-bribery and anti-kickback laws. We also must comply with a variety of other laws that impose extensive tracking and reporting related to all transfers of value provided to certain healthcare professionals and others. These laws and regulations are broad in scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to investigate, audit and monitor compliance or to alter our practices. Violations of these laws could result in litigation and we may be subject to criminal or civil penalties and sanctions, including substantial fines, imprisonment of current or former employees and exclusion from participation in governmental healthcare programs. In 2013 and 2018 we settled claims brought by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) related to the FCPA. Pursuant to these settlements, we paid fines and penalties and retained an independent compliance consultant. We continue to implement recommendations that resulted from the independent compliance consultant’s review of our commercial practices to enhance our commercial business practices.\nWe are subject to privacy, data protection and data security regulations and laws globally, and could face substantial penalties if we fail to comply with such regulations and laws:\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations globally regarding privacy, data protection, and data security, including those related to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer, and security of personally identifiable healthcare information. For example, in the United States, privacy and security regulations under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996, including the expanded requirements under the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act of 2009, establish comprehensive standards with respect to the use and disclosure of protected health information (PHI), by covered entities, in addition to setting standards to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of PHI. Further, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective in May 2018, applies to all of our activities related to products and services that we offer to European Union customers and employees. The GDPR established requirements regarding the handling of personal data and includes significant penalties for non-compliance (including possible fines of up to 4% of total company revenue). Other governmental authorities around the world are considering similar types of legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, which could impose significant limitations and increase our cost of providing our products and services where we process personal data. These laws and regulations are broad\nin scope and are subject to evolving interpretation and we have in the past been, and in the future could be, required to incur substantial costs to monitor compliance or to alter our practices.\nWe may be adversely affected by product liability claims, unfavorable court decisions or legal settlements:\nWe are exposed to potential product liability risks inherent in the design, manufacture and marketing of medical devices, many of which are implanted in the human body for long periods of time or indefinitely. We may be exposed to additional potential product liability risks related to products designed, manufactured and marketed in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including discretionary products and products permitted under the Emergency Use Authorization granted by the FDA. We are currently defendants in a number of product liability matters, including those relating to our Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems, LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads and the product liability lawsuits and claims relating to Wright legacy hip products discussed in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. These matters are subject to many uncertainties and outcomes are not predictable. Further, in November 2020 the European Parliament voted in favor of the European Representative Actions Directive (the Collective Redress Directive), which mandates a class action regime in each member state to facilitate domestic and cross-border class actions in a wide range of areas, including product liability claims with medical devices. The Collective Redress Directive will take effect in 2023 after a 24-month implementation period. The Collective Redress Directive, when implemented, could result in additional litigation risks and significant legal expenses for us. In addition, we may incur significant legal expenses for product liability claims regardless of whether we are found to be liable.\nIntellectual property litigation and infringement claims could cause us to incur significant expenses or prevent us from selling certain of our products:\nThe medical device industry is characterized by extensive intellectual property litigation and, from time to time, we are the subject of claims of infringement or misappropriation. Regardless of outcome, such claims are expensive to defend and divert management and operating personnel from other business issues. A successful claim or claims of patent or other intellectual property infringement against us could result in payment of significant monetary damages and/or royalty payments or negatively impact our ability to sell current or future products in the affected category.\nDependence on patent and other proprietary rights and failing to protect such rights or to be successful in litigation related to such rights may impact offerings in our product portfolios:\nOur long-term success largely depends on our ability to market technologically competitive products. If we fail to obtain or maintain adequate intellectual property protection, it could allow others to sell products that directly compete with proprietary features in our product portfolio. Also, our issued patents may be subject to claims challenging their validity and scope and raising other issues. In addition, currently pending or future patent applications may not result in issued patents.\nMARKET RISKS\nWe have exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on cross border transactions and translation of local currency results into United States Dollars:\nWe report our financial results in United States Dollars and approximately 30% of our net sales are denominated in foreign currencies, including the Australian Dollar, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Euro and Japanese Yen. Cross border transactions with external parties and intercompany relationships result in increased exposure to\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nforeign currency exchange effects. While we use derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange, our hedging strategies may not be successful, and our unhedged exposures continue to be subject to currency fluctuations. In addition, the weakening or strengthening of the United States Dollar results in favorable or unfavorable translation effects when the results of our foreign locations are translated into United States Dollars.\nAdditional capital that we may require in the future may not be available to us or may only be available to us on unfavorable terms, which could negatively affect our liquidity:\nOur future capital requirements will depend on many factors, including operating requirements, current and future acquisitions and the need to refinance existing debt. Our ability to issue additional debt or enter into other financing arrangements on acceptable terms could be adversely affected by our debt levels, unfavorable changes in economic conditions or uncertainties that affect the capital markets, including disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit rating agencies could also adversely affect our access to and cost of financing. Higher borrowing costs or the inability to access capital markets could adversely affect our ability to support future growth and operating requirements. In addition, we have experienced, and could continue to experience, loss of sales and profits due to delayed payments or insolvency of healthcare professionals, hospitals and other customers and suppliers facing liquidity issues caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. As a result, we may be compelled to take additional measures to preserve our cash flow, including through the reduction of operating expenses or suspension of dividend payments, at least until the consequences of the pandemic subside.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISKS\nWe are subject to cost containment measures in the United States and other countries resulting in pricing pressures:\nInitiatives to limit the growth of general healthcare expenses and hospital costs are ongoing in the markets in which we do business. These initiatives are sponsored by government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector and include price regulation and competitive pricing. For example, China has implemented a volume-based procurement process designed to decrease prices for medical devices and other products. This has already impacted our joint replacement business on a national level, and our trauma and spine products on a provincial level, and we expect further adoption of volume-based procurement provincially or nationally in China in 2022. Pricing pressure has also increased due to continued consolidation among healthcare providers, trends toward managed care, the shift toward governments becoming the primary payers of healthcare expenses, reduction in reimbursement levels and medical procedure volumes and government laws and regulations relating to sales and promotion, reimbursement and pricing generally.\nWe operate in a highly competitive industry in which competition in the development and improvement of new and existing products is significant:\nThe markets in which we compete are highly competitive. New business models, products and surgical procedures are introduced on an ongoing basis and our present or future products could be rendered obsolete or uneconomical by technological advances by us, as we continue to innovate to address physician and patient needs, or by our existing competitors and new market entrants. Our existing competitors and new market entrants may respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies, undertake more extensive marketing campaigns, have greater access to clinical information\nto support ongoing product position in the market, have greater financial, marketing and other resources or be more successful in attracting potential customers, employees and strategic partners.\nWe may be unable to maintain adequate working relationships with healthcare professionals:\nWe seek to maintain close working relationships with respected physicians and medical personnel in healthcare organizations, such as hospitals and universities, who assist in product research and development. We rely on these professionals to assist us in the development and improvement of proprietary products. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our access to these professionals has been limited as hospitals have restricted access for non-patients, including our research and development specialists and other employees, and governmental authorities have imposed travel restrictions, shutdowns or similar measures, which has adversely affected our ability to develop, market and sell products. If we are unable to maintain these relationships, our ability to develop, market and sell new and improved products could be further adversely affected.\nWe rely on indirect distribution channels and major distributors that are independent of Stryker:\nIn many markets, we rely on indirect distribution channels to market, distribute, and sell our products. These indirect channels often are the main point of contact for the healthcare professionals and healthcare organization customers who buy and use our products. Our ability to market, distribute, and sell our products through indirect channels has been adversely affected as a result of precautionary responses to the COVID-19 pandemic, including travel restrictions, suspension and shutdown orders and other measures intended to limit person-to-person contact. Our ability to continue to market, distribute, and sell our products may be at risk if the indirect channels become insolvent, choose to sell competitive products, choose to stop selling medical technology, or are subject to new or additional government regulation, whether related to the COVID-19 pandemic or for unrelated reasons.\nWe are subject to risks associated with our extensive global operations:\nWe develop, manufacture and distribute our products globally. Our global operations are subject to risks and potential costs, including changes in reimbursement, changes in regulatory requirements, differing local product preferences and product requirements, diminished protection of intellectual property in some countries, tariffs and other trade protection measures, international trade disputes and import or export requirements, difficulty in staffing and managing foreign operations, introduction of new internal business structures and programs, political and economic instability, such as the United Kingdom's exit from the European Union (Brexit), and disruptions of transportation due to a global pandemic of contagious diseases like COVID-19 or otherwise, such as reduced availability of transportation, port closures, increased border controls or closures, increased transportation costs and increased security threats to our supply chain. Our business could be adversely impacted if we are unable to successfully manage these and other risks of global operations in an increasingly volatile environment.\nWe may be unable to capitalize on previous or future acquisitions:\nIn addition to internally developed products, we invest in new products and technologies through acquisitions, including our pending acquisition of Vocera Communications, Inc. Such investments are inherently risky, and we cannot guarantee that any acquisition will be successful or will not have a material unfavorable impact on us. The risks include the activities required and resources allocated to integrate new businesses, diversion of\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nmanagement time that could adversely affect management's ability to focus on other projects, the inability to realize the expected benefits, savings or synergies from the acquisition, the loss of key personnel, litigation resulting from the acquisition and exposure to unexpected liabilities of acquired companies. In addition, we cannot be certain that the businesses we acquire will become or remain profitable.\nWe could experience a failure of a key information technology system, process or site or a breach of information security, including a cybersecurity breach or failure of one or more key information technology systems, networks, processes, associated sites or service providers:\nWe rely extensively on information technology (IT) systems to conduct business. In addition, we rely on networks and services, including internet sites, cloud and SaaS solutions, data hosting and processing facilities and tools and other hardware, software (including open source software) and technical applications and platforms, some of which are managed, hosted, provided and/or used by third-parties or their vendors, to assist in conducting our business. Numerous and evolving cybersecurity threats have posed, and will continue to pose, risks to the security of our IT systems, networks and product offerings, as well as the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Some of our products and services, and information technology systems, contain or use open source software, which poses particular risks, including potential security vulnerabilities, licensing compliance issues and quality issues. A security breach, whether of our products, of our customers’ network security and systems or of third-party hosting services, could impact the use of such products and the security of information stored therein. While we have made investments seeking to address these threats, including monitoring of networks and systems, hiring of experts, employee training and security policies for employees and third-party providers, the techniques used in these attacks change frequently and may be difficult to detect for periods of time and we may face difficulties in anticipating and implementing adequate preventative measures. In addition, a greater number of our employees working remotely during the COVID-19 pandemic has exposed us, and may continue to expose us, to greater risks related to cybersecurity and cyber-liability. If our IT systems are damaged or cease to function properly, the networks or service providers we rely upon fail to function properly, or we or one of our third-party providers suffer a loss or disclosure of our business or stakeholder information due to any number of causes ranging from catastrophic events or power outages to improper data handling or security breaches and our business continuity plans do not effectively address these failures on a timely basis, we may be exposed to reputational, competitive and business harm as well as litigation and regulatory action.\nAn inability to successfully manage the implementation of our new commercial global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system could adversely affect our operations and operating results:\nWe are in the process of implementing a new commercial global ERP system. This system will replace many of our existing operating and financial systems. Such an implementation is a major undertaking, both financially and from a management and personnel perspective. Any disruptions, delays or deficiencies in the design and implementation of our new ERP system could adversely affect our ability to process orders, ship products, provide services and customer support, send invoices and track payments, fulfill contractual obligations or otherwise operate our business.\nWe may be unable to attract and retain key employees:\nOur sales, technical and other key personnel play an integral role in\nthe development, marketing and selling of new and existing products. If we are unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force in our highly competitive industry, or if we are unable to plan effective succession for the future, we may not be able to meet our strategic business objectives. In addition, if we are unable to maintain an inclusive culture that aligns our diverse work force with our mission and values, this could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain key talent. Further, the ongoing remote work environment in response to COVID-19 could harm our culture and/or decrease employee engagement, which could adversely impact our ability to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive work force.\nInterruption of manufacturing operations could adversely affect our business:\nWe and our suppliers have manufacturing and supply sites all over the world; however, the manufacturing of certain of our product lines is concentrated in one or more plants or geographic regions. We have principal manufacturing and distribution facilities in the United States in Arizona, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Tennessee, Texas, Utah, Virginia and Washington, and outside the United States in China, France, Germany, Ireland, Mexico, the Netherlands, Puerto Rico, Switzerland and Turkey. Damage to our facilities, to our suppliers’ or service providers' facilities, or to our central distribution centers as a result of natural disasters, fires, explosions or otherwise, as well as issues in our manufacturing arising from a failure to follow specific internal protocols and procedures, compliance concerns relating to the quality systems regulation, equipment breakdown or malfunction, IT system failures or cybersecurity incidents, environmental hazard incidents or changes to environmental regulations or other factors, could adversely affect the availability of our products. In the event of an interruption in manufacturing, we may be unable to move quickly to alternate means of producing affected products to meet customer demand. In the event of a significant interruption, we may experience lengthy delays in resuming production of affected products due to the need for regulatory approvals, and we may experience loss of market share, additional expense and harm to our reputation.\nWe use a variety of raw materials, components, devices and third-party services in our global supply chains, production and distribution processes; significant shortages, price increases or unavailability of third-party services could increase our operating costs, require significant capital expenditures, or adversely impact the competitive position of our products:\nOur reliance on certain suppliers to secure raw materials, components and finished devices, and on certain third-party service providers, such as sterilization service providers, exposes us to product shortages and unanticipated increases in prices, whether due to inflationary pressure, regulatory changes or otherwise. In addition, several raw materials, components, finished devices and services are procured from a sole-source due to the quality considerations, unique intellectual property considerations or constraints associated with regulatory requirements. If sole-source suppliers or service providers are acquired or were unable or unwilling to deliver these materials or services, we may not be able to manufacture or have available one or more products during such period of unavailability and our business could suffer. In certain cases we may not be able to establish additional or replacement suppliers for such materials or service providers for such services in a timely or cost effective manner, largely as a result of FDA and other regulations that require, among other things, validation of materials, components and services prior to their use in or with our products. In addition,\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nduring 2021, the market experienced increasing inflationary pressures in part due to global supply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, which we anticipate will continue in 2022. We may experience inflationary increases in manufacturing costs and operating expenses, caused by the COVID-19 pandemic or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, and may not be able to pass these cost increases on to our customers in a timely manner, which could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and results of operations.\nOur insurance program may not be adequate to cover future losses:\nWe maintain third-party insurance to cover our exposure to certain property and casualty losses and are self-insured for claims and expenses related to other property and casualty losses, including product liability, intellectual property infringement and enforcement, environmental, and cybersecurity and data privacy losses. We manage a portion of our exposure to self-insured losses through a wholly-owned captive insurance company. Insurance coverage limits provided by third-party insurers and/or our captive insurance company may not be sufficient to fully cover unanticipated losses.\nENVIRONMENTAL, SOCIAL AND GOVERNANCE (ESG) RISKS\nWe could be negatively impacted by ESG and sustainability-related matters:\nGovernments, investors, customers, employees and other stakeholders are increasingly focusing on corporate ESG practices and disclosures, and expectations in this area are rapidly evolving. On occasion, we announce new initiatives, including goals, under our Corporate Responsibility framework. This framework is aligned with our areas of interest, which include environment and sustainability, social impact, diversity, equity and inclusion and supply chain management, among others. The criteria by which our ESG practices are assessed may change due to the quickly evolving landscape, which could result in greater expectations of us and cause us to undertake costly initiatives to satisfy such new criteria. Moreover, the increasing attention to corporate ESG initiatives could also result in reduced demand for products, reduced profits and increased investigations and litigation. If we are unable to satisfy such new criteria, investors may conclude that our policies and/or actions with respect to ESG matters are inadequate. If we fail or are perceived to have failed to achieve previously announced initiatives or goals or to accurately disclose our progress on such initiatives or goals, our reputation, business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted.\nPhysical effects of climate change or legal, regulatory or market measures intended to address climate change could adversely affect our operations and operating results:\nRisks associated with climate change are subject to increasing societal, regulatory and political focus in the United States and globally. Shifts in weather patterns caused by climate change are expected to increase the frequency, severity or duration of certain adverse weather conditions and natural disasters, such as hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, droughts, extreme temperatures or flooding, which could cause more significant business and supply chain interruptions, damage to our products and facilities as well as the infrastructure of hospitals, medical care facilities and other customers, reduced workforce availability, increased costs of raw materials and components, increased liabilities, and decreased revenues than what we have experienced in the past from such events. In addition, increased public concern over climate change could result in new legal or regulatory requirements designed to mitigate the effects of\nclimate change, which could include the adoption of more stringent environmental laws and regulations or stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations. Such developments could result in increased compliance costs and adverse impacts on raw material sourcing, manufacturing operations and the distribution of our products, which could adversely affect our operations and operating results."

We offer innovative products and services in Medical and Surgical, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes. Our goal is to achieve sales growth at the high-end of the medical technology (MedTech) industry and maintain our long-term capital allocation strategy that prioritizes: (1) Acquisitions, (2) Dividends and (3) Share repurchases.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to severe disruptions in the market and the global and United States economies that may continue for a prolonged duration and trigger a recession or a period of economic slowdown. In response, various governmental authorities and private enterprises have implemented numerous measures to contain the pandemic, such as travel bans and restrictions, quarantines, shelter-in-place orders and shutdowns. A significant number of our customers, global suppliers, vendors, distributors and manufacturing facilities are located in regions that have been affected by the pandemic. Those operations have been materially adversely affected by restrictive government and private enterprise measures implemented in response to the pandemic.\nSome of our products are particularly sensitive to reductions in elective medical procedures. Elective medical procedures were suspended in the first quarter of 2020 in many of the markets where our products are marketed and sold, which negatively affected our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations through the first quarter of 2021. In the second quarter of 2021 we saw partial recovery of elective procedures in most geographies; however, in the third quarter of 2021 we saw hospitalization rates increase, especially in the United States, as a result of the Delta variant. This, along with the Omicron variant, has continued to adversely impact elective procedures and increased inflationary pressure on our gross margin, including an increase in freight and transportation costs as well as increased absenteeism in the fourth quarter of 2021.\nOverview of 2021\nIn 2021 we achieved reported net sales growth of 19.2%. Excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures, sales grew 12.6% in constant currency. We reported net earnings of $1,994 and net earnings per diluted share\nof\n$5.21. Excluding the impact of certain items, we achieved adjusted net earnings\n(1)\nof $3,474\nand adjusted net earnings per diluted share\n(1)\nof $9.09 representing growth of 22.3%.\nEffective December 31, 2021 we changed our reportable business segments to (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine to align to our new internal reporting structure. Refer to Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nWe continued our capital allocation strategy by investing $339 in acquisitions and paying $950 in dividends to our shareholders.\nIn 2021 we had total long-term debt repayments of $1,151. In October 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated August 19, 2016. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn 2021 we completed acquisitions for total net cash consideration of $339 and $54 in future milestone payments primarily due upon the achievement of certain regulatory and commercial milestones. In September 2021 we completed the acquisition of Gauss Surgical, Inc. (Gauss) for $120 in cash and up to $40 in future milestone payments. Gauss is a medical device company that has developed Triton, an artificial intelligence-enabled platform for real-time monitoring of blood loss during surgery. Gauss is part of our Instruments business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. In January 2022 we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Vocera Communications, Inc. (Vocera) for $79.25 per share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $3.1 billion (including convertible notes). Refer to Note 6 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIn 2021 we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock under our authorized repurchase program. The total dollar value of shares of our common stock that could be acquired under our authorized repurchase program was $1,033 as of December 31, 2021.\nIn 2021 we recorded asset impairments of $264, $105 for certain long-lived and intangible assets related to the China volume-based procurement program and the remaining consisting primarily of in-process research and development, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a result of COVID-19-related demand impacts on in-process product development and certain other divestiture and restructuring activities.

Excluding the 5.5% impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in constant currency increased by 13.4% from increased unit volume partially offset by 0.8% due to lower prices. The unit volume increase was primarily due to higher shipments across all product lines.\nConsolidated net sales in 2020 were significantly negatively impacted by the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Consolidated net sales decreased 3.6% as reported and in constant currency. Excluding the 1.2% impact of acquisitions, net\nsales in constant currency decreased by 4.1% from decreased unit volume and 0.7% due to lower prices. The unit volume decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of instruments, endoscopy, neurotechnology, spine, knee and hip products partially offset by higher shipments of medical products.\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology Net Sales\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology net sales in 2021 increased 14.3% as reported and 13.3% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 1.0%.

Excluding the 0.4% impact of acquisitions, net sales in constant currency decreased by 1.8% from decreased unit volume and 0.1% due to lower prices. The unit volume decrease was primarily due to lower shipments of instruments, endoscopy and other medsurg and neurotechnology products partially offset by higher shipments of medical products.\nOrthopaedics and Spine Net Sales\nOrthopaedics and Spine net sales in 2021 increased 26.0% as reported and 24.8% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 1.2%. Excluding the 12.8% impact of acquisitions and divestitures, net sales in constant currency increased by 13.2% from increased unit volume partially offset by 1.2% due to lower prices. The unit volume increase was primarily due to higher shipments across all orthopaedics and spine products.\nOrthopaedics and Spine net sales in 2020 decreased 6.3% as reported and 6.4% in constant currency, as foreign currency exchange rates positively impacted net sales by 0.1%. Excluding the 2.3% impact of acquisitions, net sales in constant currency decreased by 7.1% from unit volume and 1.6% due to lower prices. The unit volume decrease was due to lower shipments of knees, hips and spine products partially offset by higher shipments of other orthopaedic and spine products.\nGross Profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to 64.1% in 2021 from 63.1% in 2020. Excluding the impact of the items noted below, gross profit increased to 65.9% from 63.8% in 2020 primarily due to leverage from higher sales volumes and favorable product mix, partially offset by lower selling prices.\nGross profit was significantly negatively impacted by the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, decreasing as a percentage of net sales to 63.1% from 65.1% in 2019. Excluding the impact of the items noted below, gross profit decreased to 63.8% from 65.9% in 2019 primarily due to lower sales volumes, lower selling prices, lower manufacturing volumes and unfavorable product mix due to the postponement of elective medical procedures.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses\nResearch, development and engineering expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to 7.2% in 2021 from 6.9% in 2020 and 6.5% in 2019. Excluding the impact of the items noted below, expenses increased to 6.6% in 2021 from 6.3% in 2020 and 6.1% in 2019. Disciplined ramp up in spending to facilitate our growth, including projects to develop new products, investments in new technologies and integration of recent acquisitions contributed to the increase.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales in 2021 increased to 37.6% from 37.4% in 2020 and 36.0% in 2019. Both 2021 and 2020 included charges related to certain asset impairments. Refer to Note 15 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information. Excluding the impact of the items noted below, expenses increased to 33.6% in 2021 from 33.1% in 2020 and 33.5% in 2019 primarily due to disciplined ramp up in spending to facilitate our growth.\nRecall Charges, Net of Insurance Proceeds\nRecall charges were $103, $17 and $192 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Charges were primarily due to the previously disclosed Rejuvenate and ABGII Modular-Neck hip stems and LFIT V40 femoral head voluntary recalls. Refer to Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets was $619, $472 and $464 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to the acquisition of Wright Medical Group N.V. (Wright) in the fourth quarter of 2020. Refer to Notes 6 and 8 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nOperating Income\nOperating income decreased as a percentage of sales to 15.1% in 2021 from 15.5% in 2020. Excluding the impact of the items noted below, operating income increased to 25.6% of sales in 2021 from 24.4% in 2020, primarily due to leverage from higher sales volumes partially offset by disciplined spending to facilitate our growth.\nOperating income as a percentage of sales in 2020 decreased to 15.5% from 18.2% in 2019. Excluding the impact of the items noted below, operating income decreased to 24.4% in 2020 from 26.3% in 2019 due to unfavorable product mix and the impact of lower sales volumes from the postponement of elective medical procedures partially offset by continued focus on our operating expense savings actions.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net was ($303), ($269) and ($151) in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The increase in net expense in 2021 was primarily due to increased interest expense driven by the additional debt from the bond offerings completed in June 2020 and November 2020. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nOur effective tax rate was 12.6%, 18.2% and 18.7% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflects the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations, certain discrete tax benefits, the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions and the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nThe effective income tax rate for 2020 and 2019 reflects the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions, the effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations and the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nNet Earnings\nNet earnings increased to $1,994 or $5.21 per diluted share from $1,599 or $4.20 per diluted share in 2020 and decreased from $2,083 or $5.48 per diluted share in 2019. Adjusted net earnings per diluted share\n(1)\nof $9.09 increased 22.3% from $7.43 in 2020 compared to $8.26 in 2019. The impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.19 in 2021 and reduced net earnings per diluted share by approximately $0.02 and $0.14 in 2020 and 2019.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) with certain non-GAAP financial measures, including percentage sales growth in constant currency; percentage organic sales growth; adjusted gross profit; adjusted selling, general and administrative expenses; adjusted research, development and engineering expenses; adjusted operating income; adjusted other income (expense), net; adjusted effective income tax rate; adjusted net earnings; adjusted net earnings per diluted share (Diluted EPS); free cash flow; and free cash flow conversion. We believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide meaningful information to assist investors and shareholders in understanding our financial results and assessing our prospects for future performance. Management believes percentage sales growth in constant currency and the other adjusted measures described above are important indicators of our operations because they exclude items that may not be indicative of or are unrelated to our core operating results and provide a baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. Management uses these non-GAAP financial measures for reviewing the operating results of reportable business segments and analyzing potential future business trends in connection with our budget process and bases certain management incentive compensation on these non-GAAP financial measures. To measure percentage sales growth in constant currency, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates that affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage sales growth in constant currency is calculated by translating current and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rate. To measure percentage organic sales growth, we remove the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, acquisitions and divestitures, which affect the comparability and trend of sales. Percentage organic sales growth is calculated by translating current year and prior year results at the same foreign currency exchange rates excluding the impact of acquisitions and divestitures. To measure earnings performance on a consistent and comparable basis, we exclude certain items that affect the comparability of operating results and the trend of earnings. To measure free cash flow, we adjust cash provided by operating activities by the amount of purchases of property, plant and equipment and proceeds from long-lived asset disposals and remove the impact of certain legal settlements and recall payments. To measure free cash flow conversion we divide free cash flow by adjusted net earnings. These adjustments are irregular in timing and may not be\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nindicative of our past and future performance. The following are examples of the types of adjustments that may be included in a period:\n1.\nAcquisition and integration-related costs\n. Costs related to integrating recently acquired businesses (e.g., costs associated with the termination of sales relationships, workforce reductions and other integration-related activities) and specific costs (e.g., inventory step-up and deal costs) related to the consummation of the acquisition process.\n2.\nAmortization of purchased intangible assets\n. Periodic amortization expense related to purchased intangible assets.\n3.\nRestructuring-related and other charges\n. Costs associated with the termination of sales relationships in certain countries, workforce reductions, elimination of product lines, certain long-lived and intangible asset impairments and associated costs and other restructuring-related activities.\n4.\nMedical device regulations.\nCosts specific to updating our quality system, product labeling, asset write-offs and product remanufacturing to comply with the new medical device reporting regulations and other requirements of the European Union and the more stringent regulations for medical devices in China.\n5.\nRecall-related matters\n. Our best estimate of the minimum of the range of probable loss to resolve the Rejuvenate, LFIT V40 and other product recalls.\n6.\nRegulatory and legal matters\n. Our best estimate of the\nminimum of the range of probable loss to resolve certain regulatory matters and other legal settlements.\n7.\nTax matters\n. Charges represent the impact of accounting for certain significant and discrete tax items.\nBecause non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, it may not be possible to compare these financial measures with other companies' non-GAAP financial measures having the same or similar names. These adjusted financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for reported sales growth, gross profit, selling, general and administrative expenses, research, development and engineering expenses, operating income, other income (expense), net, effective income tax rate, net earnings and net earnings per diluted share, the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures are an additional way of viewing aspects of our operations when viewed with our GAAP results and the reconciliations to corresponding GAAP financial measures at the end of the discussion of Consolidated Results of Operations below. We strongly encourage investors and shareholders to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure.\nThe weighted-average diluted shares outstanding used in the calculation of non-GAAP net earnings per diluted share are the same as those used in the calculation of reported net earnings per diluted share for the respective period.\nReconciliation of the Most Directly Comparable GAAP Financial Measure to Non-GAAP Financial Measure\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nFINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY\nWe believe our financial condition continues to be of high quality, as evidenced by our ability to generate substantial cash from operations and to readily access capital markets at competitive rates despite the COVID-19 pandemic. Operating cash flow provides the primary source of cash to fund operating needs and capital expenditures. Excess operating cash is used first to fund acquisitions to complement our portfolio of businesses. Other discretionary uses include dividends and share repurchases. We supplement operating cash flow with debt to fund our activities as necessary. Our overall cash position reflects our business results and a global cash management strategy that takes into account liquidity management, economic factors and tax considerations.\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities was $3,263, $3,277 and $2,191 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The slight decrease from 2020 was primarily due to higher accounts receivable, partially offset by increased net earnings and accounts payable.\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities was $859, $4,701 and $1,455 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The decrease in cash used in 2021 was primarily due to decreased payments for acquisitions and certain other businesses and related assets. In 2020 we acquired Wright, while in 2019 we acquired Mobius Imaging and Cardan Robotics and certain other businesses and related assets.\nFinancing Activities\nCash provided by (used in) financing activities was ($2,365), ($11) and $3 in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily driven by long-term debt repayments of $1,151 and dividend payments of $950 in 2021. In 2020 we secured a $400 term loan in November, issued $600 of notes in November and $2,300 of notes in June, which was offset by total debt repayments of $2,297 and dividend payments of $863. There were no share repurchases in 2021 or 2020.\nWe maintain debt levels that we consider appropriate after evaluating a number of factors including cash requirements for ongoing operations, investment and financing plans (including acquisitions and share repurchase activities) and overall cost of capital. Refer to Note 10 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information.\nLiquidity\nCash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were $3,019 and $3,024, and our current assets exceeded current liabilities by $5,468 and $4,666 on December 31, 2021 and 2020. We anticipate being able to support our short-term liquidity and operating needs from a variety of sources including cash from operations, commercial paper and existing credit lines. In October 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated August 19, 2016. The primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the facility by $750 to $2,250, extend the maturity date to October 26, 2026, increase the leverage ratio to 3.75 and provide LIBOR replacement language.\nWe raised funds in the capital markets in 2020 and 2019 and may continue to do so from time-to-time. We continue to have strong investment-grade short-term and long-term debt ratings that we believe should enable us to refinance our debt as needed.\nOur cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held in locations outside the United States was approximately 26% and 30% on December 31, 2021 and 2020. We intend to use this cash to expand operations organically and through acquisitions.\nGuarantees and Other Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, of a magnitude that we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\nCONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND FORWARD-LOOKING CASH REQUIREMENTS\nAs further described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, in 2021 we recorded charges to earnings related to the Rejuvenate and ABG II and LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads recall matters and recorded product liabilities relating to Wright legacy hip products claims. Recorded reserves represent the minimum of the range of probable cost remaining to resolve these matters. The final outcome of these matters is dependent on many variables that are difficult to predict. The ultimate cost to entirely resolve these matters may be materially different from the amount of the current estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows. We are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which payments will be made.\nAs further described in Note 11 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2021 we had a reserve for\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nuncertain income tax positions of $444. Due to uncertainties regarding the ultimate resolution of income tax audits, we are not able to reasonably estimate the future periods in which any income tax payments to settle these uncertain income tax positions will be made.\nAs further described in Note 12 to our Consolidated Financial Statements, on December 31, 2021 our defined benefit pension plans were underfunded by $493, of which approximately $491 related to plans outside the United States. Due to the rules affecting tax-deductible contributions in the jurisdictions in which the plans are offered and the impact of future plan asset performance, changes in interest rates and potential changes in legislation in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions, we are not able to reasonably estimate the amounts that may be required to fund defined benefit pension plans.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nIn preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, there are certain accounting policies, which may require substantial judgment or estimation in their application. We believe these accounting policies and the others set forth in Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements are critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition.\nActual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions, and any such differences could be material to our results of operations and financial condition.\nInventory Reserves\nWe maintain reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell certain products at prices in excess of current carrying costs. We make estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and record provisions based on historical experience, expiration of sterilization dates and expected future trends. If actual product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favorable than projected by management, additional inventory write downs may be required, which could unfavorably affect future operating results.\nIncome Taxes\nOur annual tax rate is determined based on our income, statutory tax rates and the tax impacts of items treated differently for tax purposes than for financial reporting purposes. Tax law requires certain items be included in the tax return at different times than the items are reflected in the financial statements. Some of these differences are permanent, such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return, and some differences are temporary and reverse over time, such as depreciation expense. These temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nDeferred tax assets generally represent the tax effect of items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement. Deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in our financial statements for which payment was deferred, the tax effect of expenditures for which a deduction was taken in our tax return but has not yet been recognized in our\nfinancial statements or assets recorded at fair value in business combinations for which there was no corresponding tax basis adjustment.\nInherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, tax planning opportunities and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Although realization is not assured, management believes it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, will be realized.\nWe operate in multiple jurisdictions with complex tax policy and regulatory environments. In certain of these jurisdictions, we may take tax positions that management believes are supportable but are potentially subject to successful challenge by the applicable taxing authority. These differences of interpretation with the respective governmental taxing authorities can be impacted by the local economic and fiscal environment. We evaluate our tax positions and establish liabilities in accordance with the applicable accounting guidance on uncertainty in income taxes. We review these tax uncertainties in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, and adjust them accordingly. We have a number of audits in process in various jurisdictions. Although the resolution of these tax positions is uncertain, based on currently available information, we believe that it is more likely than not that the ultimate outcomes will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nDue to the number of estimates and assumptions inherent in calculating the various components of our tax provision, certain changes or future events, such as changes in tax legislation, geographic mix of earnings, completion of tax audits or earnings repatriation plans, could have an impact on those estimates and our effective tax rate.\nAcquisitions, Goodwill and Intangibles, and Long-Lived Assets\nOur financial statements include the operations of an acquired business starting from the completion of the acquisition. In addition, the assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded on the date of acquisition at their respective estimated fair values, with any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired recorded as goodwill.\nSignificant judgment is required in estimating the fair value of intangible assets and in assigning their respective useful lives. Accordingly, we typically obtain the assistance of third-party valuation specialists for significant items. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on future expectations and assumptions deemed reasonable by management but are inherently uncertain. We typically use an income method to estimate the fair value of intangible assets, which is based on forecasts of the expected future cash flows attributable to the respective assets. Significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the valuations reflect a consideration of other marketplace participants and include the amount and timing of future cash flows (including expected growth rates and profitability), the underlying product or technology life cycles, the economic barriers to entry and the discount rate applied to the cash flows. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur that could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDetermining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment. With the exception of certain trade names, the majority of our acquired intangible assets (e.g., certain trademarks or\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nbrands, customer and distributor relationships, patents and technologies) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our assessment as to the useful lives of these intangible assets is based on a number of factors including competitive environment, market share, trademark, brand history, underlying product life cycles, operating plans and the macroeconomic environment of the countries in which the trademarked or branded products are sold. Our estimates of the useful lives of determinable-lived intangibles are primarily based on these same factors. Determinable-lived intangible assets are amortized to expense over their estimated useful life.\nIn some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations, IPRD is considered to be an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions, IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.\nThe value of indefinite-lived intangible assets and goodwill is not amortized but is tested at least annually for impairment. Our impairment testing for goodwill is performed separately from our impairment testing of indefinite-lived intangibles. We perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill and periodically corroborate that assessment with quantitative information. In certain circumstances, we also use a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. In those circumstances we test goodwill for impairment by reviewing the carrying value compared to the fair value at the reporting unit level. We test individual indefinite-lived intangibles by reviewing the individual carrying values compared to the fair value. We determine the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the income approach. Under the income approach, we calculate the fair value of our reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to evaluate the impact of operating and macroeconomic changes and to estimate future cash flows to measure fair value. Assumptions used in our impairment evaluations, such as forecasted growth rates and cost of capital, are consistent with internal projections and operating plans. We believe such assumptions and estimates are also comparable to those that would be used by other marketplace participants.\nOur annual impairment testing indicated that all reporting unit goodwill fair values significantly exceeded their respective recorded values. Future changes in the judgments, assumptions and estimates that are used in our impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including discount and tax rates and future cash flow projections, could result in significantly different estimates of the fair values. A significant reduction in the estimated fair values could result in impairment charges that could materially affect our results of operations.\nWe review our other long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows, which is at the individual asset level or the asset group level. The undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over their useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of\nthe assets may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related assets or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale, if any, are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nLegal and Other Contingencies\nWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor and intellectual property, and other matters that are more fully described in Note 7 to our Consolidated Financial Statements. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings, the claimants seek damages, as well as other compensatory and equitable relief, that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to reasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, for the resolution of these legal matters is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those projected by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are currently self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nNEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRefer to Note 1 to our Consolidated Financial Statements for further information."

    "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Stryker Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings and comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements“). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the consolidated results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 11, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\n/s/\nERNST & YOUNG LLP\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1974\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nFebruary 11, 2022\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EARNINGS\nAnti-dilutive shares excluded from the calculation of dilutive employee stock compensation were de minimis in all periods.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nStryker Corporation and Subsidiaries\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 -\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations:\nStryker (the \"Company,\" \"we,\" \"us,\" or \"our\") is one of the world's leading medical technology companies and, together with its customers, is driven to make healthcare better. The Company offers innovative products and services in Medical and Surgical, Neurotechnology, Orthopaedics and Spine that help improve patient and hospital outcomes. Our products include surgical equipment and surgical navigation systems; endoscopic and communications systems; patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products; neurosurgical and neurovascular devices; implants used in joint replacement and trauma surgeries; Mako Robotic-Arm Assisted technology; spinal devices; as well as other products used in a variety of medical specialties.\nBasis of Presentation and Consolidation:\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. We have no material interests in variable interest entities and none that require consolidation. Prior years' segment results have been reclassified to conform with current year presentation in our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net sales and expenses in the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nSales are recognized as the performance obligations to deliver products or services are satisfied and are recorded based on the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for satisfying the performance obligations. Our sales are recognized primarily when we transfer control to the customer, which can be on the date of shipment, the date of receipt by the customer or, for most Orthopaedics products, when we have received a purchase order and appropriate notification the product has been used or implanted. Products and services are primarily transferred to customers at a point in time, with some transfers of services taking place over time.\nSales represent the amount of consideration we expect to receive from customers in exchange for transferring products and services. Net sales exclude sales, value added and other taxes we collect from customers. Other costs to obtain and fulfill contracts are generally expensed as incurred due to the short-term nature of most of our sales. We extend terms of payment to our customers based on commercially reasonable terms for the markets of our customers, while also considering their credit quality.\nA provision for estimated sales returns, discounts and rebates is recognized as a reduction of sales in the same period that the sales are recognized. Our estimate of the provision for sales returns has been established based on contract terms with our customers and historical business practices and current trends. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in net sales.\nCost of Sales:\nCost of sales is primarily comprised of direct materials and supplies consumed in the manufacture of product, as well as manufacturing labor, depreciation expense and direct\noverhead expense necessary to acquire and convert the purchased materials and supplies into finished product. Cost of sales also includes the cost to distribute products to customers, inbound freight costs, warehousing costs and other shipping and handling activity.\nResearch, Development and Engineering Expenses:\nResearch, development and engineering costs are charged to expense as incurred. Costs include research, development and engineering activities relating to the development of new products, improvement of existing products, technical support of products and compliance with governmental regulations for the protection of customers and patients. Costs primarily consist of salaries, wages, consulting and depreciation and maintenance of research facilities and equipment.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expense is primarily comprised of selling expenses, marketing expenses, administrative and other indirect overhead costs, amortization of loaner instrumentation, depreciation and amortization expense of non-manufacturing assets and other miscellaneous operating items.\nCurrency Translation:\nFinancial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States generally are measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Adjustments to translate those statements into United States Dollars are recorded in other comprehensive income (OCI). Transactional exchange gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net.\nCash Equivalents:\nHighly liquid investments with remaining stated maturities of three months or less when purchased or other money market instruments that are redeemable upon demand are considered cash equivalents and recorded at cost.\nMarketable Securities:\nMarketable securities consist of marketable debt securities, certificates of deposit and mutual funds. Mutual funds are acquired to offset changes in certain liabilities related to deferred compensation arrangements and are expected to be used to settle these liabilities and are recognized in other noncurrent assets. Pursuant to our investment policy, all individual marketable security investments must have a minimum credit quality of single A (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) and A2 (Moody’s Corporation) at the time of acquisition, while the overall portfolio of marketable securities must maintain a minimum average credit quality of double A (Standard & Poor’s and Fitch) or Aa (Moody’s Corporation). In the event of a rating downgrade below the minimum credit quality subsequent to purchase, the marketable security investment is evaluated to determine the appropriate action to take to minimize the overall risk to our marketable security investment portfolio. Our marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale and trading securities. Investments in trading securities represent participant-directed investments of deferred employee compensation.\nAccounts Receivable:\nAccounts receivable consists of trade and other miscellaneous receivables. An allowance is maintained for doubtful accounts for estimated losses in the collection of accounts receivable. Estimates are made regarding the ability of customers to make required payments based on historical credit experience, current market conditions and expected credit losses. Accounts receivable are written off when all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.\nInventories:\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value, with cost generally determined using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) cost method. For excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell specific products at prices in excess of current carrying costs, reserves are maintained to reduce current carrying cost to net realizable value.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nFinancial Instruments:\nOur financial instruments consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, other investments, accounts payable, debt and foreign currency exchange contracts. The carrying value of our financial instruments, with the exception of our senior unsecured notes, approximates fair value on December 31, 2021 and 2020. Refer to Notes 3 and 10 for further details.\nAll marketable securities are recognized at fair value. Adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as available-for-sale are recognized as increases or decreases, net of income taxes, within accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) in shareholders’ equity and adjustments to the fair value of marketable securities that are classified as trading are recognized in earnings. The amortized cost of marketable debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity computed under the effective interest method. Such amortization and interest and realized gains and losses are included in other income (expense), net. The cost of securities sold is determined by the specific identification method.\nWe review declines in the fair value of our investments classified as available-for-sale to determine whether the decline in fair value is a result of credit loss or other factors. Impairments of available-for-sale marketable debt securities related to credit loss are included in earnings and impairments related to other factors are recognized within AOCI.\nDerivatives:\nAll derivatives are recognized at fair value and reported on a gross basis. We enter into forward currency exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of currency fluctuations on transactions denominated in nonfunctional currencies, thereby limiting our risk that would otherwise result from changes in exchange rates. The periods of the forward currency exchange contracts correspond to the periods of the exposed transactions, with realized gains and losses included in the measurement and recording of transactions denominated in the nonfunctional currencies. All forward currency exchange contracts are recorded at their fair value each period.\nForward currency exchange contracts designated as cash flow hedges are designed to hedge the variability of cash flows associated with forecasted transactions denominated in a foreign currency that will take place in the future. These nonfunctional currency exposures principally relate to forecasted intercompany sales and purchases of manufactured products and generally have maturities up to eighteen months. Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows. At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders’ equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in cost of goods sold in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Cash flows associated with these hedges are included in cash from operations in the same category as the cash flows from the items being hedged.\nForward currency exchange contracts are used to offset our exposure to the change in value of specific foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities, primarily intercompany payables and receivables. These derivatives are not designated as hedges and, therefore, changes in the value of these forward contracts are recognized in earnings, thereby offsetting the current earnings effect of the related changes in value of foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities. The estimated fair value of our forward currency exchange contracts represents the\nmeasurement of the contracts at month-end spot rates as adjusted by current forward points.\nFrom time to time, we designate derivative and non-derivative financial instruments as net investment hedges of our investments in certain international subsidiaries. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as a net investment hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is recognized in OCI and reported as a component of AOCI. We have elected to use the spot method to assess effectiveness for our derivatives designated as net investment hedges. Accordingly, the change in fair value attributable to changes in the spot rate is recorded in AOCI. We exclude the spot-forward difference from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and amortize this amount separately on a straight-line basis over the term of the forward contracts. This amortization is recognized in other income (expense), net.\nFrom time to time, we designate forward starting interest rate derivative instruments as cash flow hedges to manage the exposure to interest rate volatility with regard to future issuance and refinancing of debt. Changes in value of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI on the Consolidated Balance Sheets until earnings are affected by the variability of the underlying cash flows. At that time, the applicable amount of gain or loss from the derivative instrument that is deferred in shareholders’ equity is reclassified into earnings and is included in interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nInterest rate derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges have been used in the past to manage the exposure to interest rate movements and to reduce borrowing costs by converting fixed-rate debt into floating-rate debt. Under these agreements, we agree to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at cost. Depreciation is generally computed by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\nthree\nto\n30\nyears for buildings and improvements and\nthree\nto\n15\nyears for machinery and equipment.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair value of tangible net assets of acquired businesses at the acquisition date, after amounts allocated to other identifiable intangible assets. Factors that contribute to the recognition of goodwill include synergies that are specific to our business and not available to other market participants and are expected to increase net sales and profits; acquisition of a talented workforce; cost savings opportunities; the strategic benefit of expanding our presence in core and adjacent markets; and diversifying our product portfolio.\nThe fair values of other identifiable intangible assets acquired in a business combination are primarily determined using the income approach. Other intangible assets include, but are not limited to, developed technology, customer and distributor relationships (which reflect expected continued customer or distributor patronage) and trademarks and patents. Intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives of\nfour\nto\n40\nyears. Certain acquired trade names are considered to have indefinite lives and are not amortized, but are assessed annually for potential impairment as described below.\nIn some of our acquisitions, we acquire in-process research and development (IPRD) intangible assets. For acquisitions accounted for as business combinations IPRD is considered to\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nbe an indefinite-lived intangible asset until the research is completed (then it becomes a determinable-lived intangible asset) or determined to have no future use (then it is impaired). For asset acquisitions IPRD is expensed immediately unless there is an alternative future use.\nGoodwill, Intangibles and Long-Lived Asset Impairment Tests:\nWe perform our annual impairment test for goodwill in the fourth quarter of each year. We consider qualitative indicators of the fair value of a reporting unit when it is unlikely that a reporting unit has impaired goodwill and periodically corroborate that assessment with quantitative information. In certain circumstances, we may also utilize a discounted cash flow analysis that requires certain assumptions and estimates be made regarding market conditions and our future profitability. Indefinite-lived intangible assets are also tested at least annually for impairment by comparing the individual carrying values to the fair value.\nWe review long-lived assets for indicators of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The evaluation is performed at the lowest level of identifiable cash flows. Undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the related assets are estimated over the asset's useful life based on updated projections. If the evaluation indicates that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable, any potential impairment is measured based upon the fair value of the related asset or asset group as determined by an appropriate market appraisal or other valuation technique. Assets classified as held for sale are recorded at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell.\nShare-Based Compensation:\nS\nhare-based compensation is in the form of stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and performance stock units (PSUs). Stock options are granted under long-term incentive plans to certain key employees and non-employee directors at an exercise price not less than the fair market value of the underlying common stock, which is the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of grant. The options are granted for periods of up to\n10\nyears and become exercisable in varying installments.\nWe grant RSUs to key employees and non-employee directors and PSUs to certain key employees under our long-term incentive plans. The fair value of RSUs is determined based on the number of shares granted and the quoted closing price of our common stock on the date of grant, adjusted for the fact that RSUs do not include anticipated dividends. RSUs generally vest in one-third increments over a\nthree-year\nperiod and are settled in stock. PSUs are earned over a\nthree-year\nperformance cycle and vest in March of the year following the end of that performance cycle. The number of PSUs that will ultimately be earned is based on our performance relative to pre-established goals in that\nthree-year\nperformance cycle. The fair value of PSUs is determined based on the quoted closing price of our common stock on the day of grant.\nCompensation expense is recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings based on the estimated fair value of the awards on the grant date. Compensation expense recognized reflects an estimate of the number of awards expected to vest after taking into consideration an estimate of award forfeitures based on actual experience and is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, which is generally the period required to obtain full vesting. Management expectations related to the achievement of performance goals associated with PSU grants is assessed regularly and that assessment is used to\ndetermine whether PSU grants are expected to vest. If performance-based milestones related to PSU grants are not met or not expected to be met, any compensation expense recognized associated with such grants will be reversed.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted income tax rates in effect for the years in which the differences are expected to reverse. Deferred income tax benefits generally represent the change in net deferred income tax assets and liabilities in the year. Other amounts result from adjustments related to acquisitions and foreign currency as appropriate.\nWe operate in multiple income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally. Accordingly, management must determine the appropriate allocation of income to each of these jurisdictions based on current interpretations of complex income tax regulations. Income tax authorities in these jurisdictions regularly perform audits of our income tax filings. Income tax audits associated with the allocation of this income and other complex issues, including inventory transfer pricing and cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements, may require an extended period of time to resolve and may result in significant income tax adjustments if changes to the income allocation are required between jurisdictions with different income tax rates.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nIn October 2021 the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2021-08,\nBusiness Combinations: Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n. This update requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. We are evaluating the impact this update will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Recently Adopted\nNo new accounting pronouncements were issued or became effective in the period that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNOTE 2 -\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nWe disaggregate our net sales by product line and geographic location for each of our segments as we believe it best depicts how the nature, amount, timing and certainty of our net sales and cash flows are affected by economic factors.\nProducts and services are primarily transferred to customers at a point in time, with some transfers of services taking place over time. In 2021 less than\n10\n% of our sales were recognized as services transferred over time. Refer to Note 1 for further discussion on our revenue recognition policies.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology\nMedSurg and Neurotechnology products include surgical equipment and navigation systems (Instruments), endoscopic and communications systems (Endoscopy), patient handling, emergency medical equipment and intensive care disposable products (Medical), minimally invasive products for the treatment of acute ischemic and hemorrhagic stroke (Neurovascular), a comprehensive line of products for traditional brain and open skull based surgical procedures; orthobiologic and biosurgery products, including synthetic bone grafts and vertebral\naugmentation products (Neuro Cranial) and other medical device products used in a variety of medical specialties. Substantially all MedSurg and Neurotechnology sales are recognized when a purchase order has been received and control has transferred. For certain Endoscopy, Instruments and Medical services, we may recognize sales over time as we satisfy performance obligations that may include an obligation to complete installation, provide training and perform ongoing services, generally performed within one year.\nOrthopaedics and Spine\nOrthopaedics and Spine products consist primarily of implants used in hip and knee joint replacements and trauma and extremity surgeries, and cervical, thoracolumbar and interbody systems used in spinal injury, deformity and degenerative therapies. Substantially all Orthopaedics sales are recognized when we have received a purchase order and appropriate notification the product has been used or implanted. Substantially all Spine sales are recognized when a purchase order has been received and control has transferred. For certain Orthopaedic products in the \"other\" category, we recognize sales at a point in time, as well as over time for performance obligations that may include an obligation to complete installation and provide training and ongoing services. Performance obligations are generally satisfied within one year.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe nature of our products and services do not generally give rise to contract assets as we typically do not incur costs to fulfill a contract before a product or service is provided to a customer. Our costs to obtain contracts are typically in the form of sales commissions paid to employees or third-party agents. Certain sales commissions paid to employees prior to recognition of sales are recorded as contract assets. We expense sales commissions associated with obtaining a contract at the time of the sale or as incurred as the amortization period is generally less than one year. These costs have been presented within selling, general and administrative expenses. On December 31, 2021 contract assets recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were not significant.\nOur contract liabilities arise as a result of consideration received from customers at inception of contracts for certain businesses or where the timing of billing for services precedes satisfaction of our performance obligations. We generally satisfy performance obligations within one year from the contract inception date. Our contract liabilities were $\n529\nand $\n416\non December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nNOTE 3 -\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value are classified in their entirety based on the lowest level of input and disclosed in one of the following three categories:\nUse of observable market data, when available, is required in making fair value measurements. When inputs used fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement. We\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\ndetermine fair value for Level 1 instruments using exchange-traded prices for identical instruments. We determine fair value of Level 2 instruments using exchange-traded prices of similar instruments, where available, or utilizing other observable inputs that take into account our credit risk and that of our counterparties. Foreign currency exchange contracts and interest rate hedges are included in Level 2 and we use inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability. The Level 2 derivative instruments are primarily valued using standard calculations and models that use readily observable market data as their basis. Our Level 3 liabilities are comprised of contingent consideration arising from recently completed acquisitions. We determine fair value of these Level 3 liabilities using a discounted cash flow technique. Significant unobservable inputs were used in our assessment of fair value, including assumptions regarding future business results, discount rates, discount periods and probability assessments based on the likelihood of reaching various targets. We remeasure the fair value of our assets and liabilities each reporting period. We record the changes in fair value within selling, general and administrative expense and the changes in the time value of money within other income (expense), net.\nOn December 31, 2021 the aggregate difference between the cost and fair value of available-for-sale marketable securities was nominal. Interest and marketable securities income was $\n68\n, $\n102\nand $\n155\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, which was recorded in other income (expense), net.\nOur investments in available-for-sale marketable securities had a minimum credit quality rating of A2 (Moody's), A (Standard & Poor's) and A (Fitch). We do not plan to sell the investments, and it is not more likely than not that we will be required to sell the\ninvestments before recovery of their amortized cost basis, which may be maturity.\nNOTE 4 -\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS\nWe use operational and economic hedges, foreign currency exchange forward contracts, net investment hedges (both derivative and non-derivative financial instruments) and interest rate derivative instruments to manage the impact of currency exchange and interest rate fluctuations on earnings, cash flow and equity. We do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes. We are exposed to potential credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties on our outstanding derivative instruments but do not anticipate nonperformance by any of our counterparties. Should a counterparty default, our maximum loss exposure is the asset balance of the instrument.\nForeign Currency Hedges\nWe had €\n2.0\nbillion and €\n1.5\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 in certain forward currency contracts designated as net investment hedges to hedge a portion of our investments in certain of our entities with functional currencies denominated in Euros. In addition to these derivative financial instruments designated as net investment hedges, we had €\n4.4\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020 of senior unsecured notes designated as net investment hedges to selectively hedge portions of our investment in certain international subsidiaries. The currency effects of our Euro-denominated senior unsecured notes are reflected in AOCI within shareholders' equity where they offset gains and losses recorded on our net investment in international subsidiaries.\nOn December 31, 2021 the total after-tax gain (loss) in AOCI related to designated net investment hedges was ($\n34\n).\nPretax gains (losses) on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges of $\n9\nand net investment hedges of $\n37\nrecorded in AOCI are expected to be reclassified to cost of sales and other income (expense), net in earnings within 12 months as of December 31, 2021. This cash flow hedge reclassification is primarily due to the sale of inventory that includes previously hedged purchases. A component of the AOCI amounts related to net investment hedges is reclassified over the life of the hedge\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\ninstruments as we elected to exclude the initial value of the component related to the spot-forward difference from the effectiveness assessment.\nInterest Rate Hedges\nIn 2021 a loss of $\n11\nwas reclassified from AOCI to other income (expense), net in earnings relating to the termination of forward starting interest rate swaps with notional amounts of $\n750\ndesignated as cash flow hedges as we now consider it probable that the original forecasted debt issuances will not occur. Pretax gains of $\n5\nrecorded in AOCI related to other interest rate hedges closed in conjunction with debt issuances are expected to be reclassified to other income (expense), net in earnings within 12 months of December 31, 2021. The cash flow effect of interest rate hedges is recorded in cash flow from operations.\nNOTE 5 -\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE (LOSS) INCOME (AOCI)\nNOTE 6 -\nACQUISITIONS\nWe acquire stock in companies and various assets that continue to support our capital deployment and product development strategies. The aggregate purchase price of our acquisitions, net of cash acquired was $\n393\nand $\n4,304\nin 2021 and 2020.\nIn September 2021 we completed the acquisition of Gauss Surgical, Inc. (Gauss) for $\n120\nin cash and up to $\n40\nin future milestone payments. Gauss is a medical device company that has developed Triton, an artificial intelligence-enabled platform for real-time monitoring of blood loss during surgery. Gauss is part of our Instruments business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes\n.\nIn November 2020 we completed the acquisition of Wright Medical Group N.V. (Wright) for $\n30.75\nper share, or an aggregate purchase price of $\n4.1\nbillion ($\n5.6\nbillion including convertible notes). Wright is a global medical device company focused on extremities and biologics. Wright is part of our Trauma and Extremities business within Orthopaedics and Spine. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes\n.\nIn November and December 2020 note holders elected to redeem the\n1.625\n% and\n2.25\n% convertible notes assumed in the Wright acquisition for $\n864\nand $\n576\n. These repayments are classified as financing activities.\nIn December 2020 we completed the acquisition of OrthoSensor, Inc. (OrthoSensor). OrthoSensor is a leader in the digital evolution of musculoskeletal care and sensor technology for total joint replacement. OrthoSensor is part of our Joint Replacement business within Orthopaedics and Spine. Goodwill attributable to the acquisition is not deductible for tax purposes\n.\nHad the above acquisitions taken place as of the beginning of the comparable prior year, our consolidated financial results of operations in the aggregate would not have been materially different. Accordingly, we have not disclosed pro forma financial information.\nPurchase price allocations for our significant acquisitions are:\nPurchase price allocations for 2021 acquisitions were based on preliminary valuations, primarily related to intangible assets, product liabilities and deferred income taxes. Our estimates and assumptions are subject to change within the measurement period. The purchase price allocations for Wright, OrthoSensor and other 2020 acquisitions were finalized in 2021 without material adjustments.\nIn January 2022 we announced a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the issued and outstanding common shares of Vocera Communications, Inc. (Vocera) for $\n79.25\nper share, or an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n3.1\nbillion (including convertible notes). Pursuant to the agreement we commenced a tender offer to purchase all of the outstanding shares of common stock of Vocera for $\n79.25\nper share in cash. The boards of directors of both Stryker and Vocera have unanimously approved the transaction. We expect the acquisition to close in the first quarter of 2022, subject to completion of the tender offer and other customary conditions. Vocera has emerged as a leading platform in the digital care coordination and communication category. Following closing, we plan to integrate Vocera into our Medical business within MedSurg and Neurotechnology.\nNOTE 7 -\nCONTINGENCIES AND COMMITMENTS\nWe are involved in various ongoing proceedings, legal actions and claims arising in the normal course of business, including proceedings related to product, labor, intellectual property and other matters, the most significant of which are more fully described below. The outcomes of these matters will generally not be known for prolonged periods of time. In certain of the legal proceedings the claimants seek damages as well as other compensatory and equitable relief that could result in the payment of significant claims and settlements and/or the imposition of injunctions or other equitable relief. For legal matters for which management had sufficient information to\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nreasonably estimate our future obligations, a liability representing management's best estimate of the probable loss, or the minimum of the range of probable losses when a best estimate within the range is not known, is recorded. The estimates are based on consultation with legal counsel, previous settlement experience and settlement strategies. If actual outcomes are less favorable than those estimated by management, additional expense may be incurred, which could unfavorably affect future operating results. We are self-insured for certain claims and expenses. The ultimate cost to us with respect to product liability claims could be materially different than the amount of the current estimates and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations and cash flows.\nRecall Matters\nIn June 2012 we voluntarily recalled our Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems and terminated global distribution of these hip products. Product liability lawsuits relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us. In November 2014 we entered into a settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had revision surgery prior to November 3, 2014 and in December 2016 the settlement program was extended to patients who had revision surgery prior to December 19, 2016. In September 2020 we entered into a second settlement agreement to compensate eligible United States patients who had revision surgery prior to September 9, 2020. We continue to offer support for recall-related care and reimburse patients who are not eligible to enroll in the settlement program for testing and treatment services, including any necessary revision surgeries. In addition, there are remaining lawsuits that we will continue to defend against.\nIn August 2016 and May 2018 we voluntarily recalled certain lot-specific sizes and offsets of LFIT Anatomic CoCr V40 Femoral Heads. Product liability lawsuits and claims relating to this voluntary recall have been filed against us. In November 2018 we entered into a settlement agreement to resolve a significant number of claims and lawsuits related to the recalls. In December 2021, we reached a second agreement to resolve a significant number of claims and lawsuits related to the recalls. The specific terms of the settlement agreements, including the financial terms, are confidential.\nWith the acquisition of Wright as more fully described in Note 6, we are responsible for certain product liability claims, primarily related to certain hip products sold by Wright prior to its 2014 divestiture of the OrthoRecon business. We will continue to evaluate each claim and the possible loss we may incur.\nWe have incurred, and expect to incur in the future, costs associated with the defense and settlement of these matters. In 2021, we recorded charges of $\n103\nand made payments of $\n221\n, primarily related to Rejuvenate and ABG II Modular-Neck hip stems. Based on the information that has been received, we have estimated the remaining range of probable loss related to recall matters globally to be approximately $\n385\nto $\n520\n. We have recorded reserves representing the remaining minimum of the range of probable loss. The final outcomes of these matters are dependent on many factors that are difficult to predict. Accordingly, the ultimate cost related to these matters may be materially different than the amount of our current estimate and accruals and could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows.\nLeases\nWe lease various manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices as well as equipment under operating leases. We evaluate our contracts to identify leases, which is generally if there is an identified asset and we\nhave the right to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the economic benefit from the use of the identified asset. Certain of our lease agreements contain rent escalation clauses (including index-based escalations), rent holidays, capital improvement funding or other lease incentives. We recognize our minimum rental expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease beginning with the date of initial control of the asset. Right-of-use assets are recorded in Other noncurrent assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Current and noncurrent lease liabilities are recorded in Accrued expenses and other liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities, respectively.\nWe have made certain significant assumptions and judgments when recording leases. For all asset classes, we elected to not recognize a right-of-use asset and lease liability for short-term leases and not separate non-lease components from lease components to which they relate and have accounted for the combined lease and non-lease components as a single lease component. The determination of the discount rate used in a lease is our incremental borrowing rate which is based on what we would normally pay to borrow on a collateralized basis over a similar term an amount equal to the lease payments.\nOperating lease expense totaled $\n133\n, $\n130\n, and $\n133\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nFuture Obligations\nWe have purchase commitments for materials, supplies, services and property, plant and equipment as part of the normal course of business. In addition, we lease various manufacturing, warehousing and distribution facilities, administrative and sales offices as well as equipment under operating leases. Refer to Note 10 for more information on the debt obligations.\nNOTE 8 -\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nWe completed our annual impairment tests of goodwill in 2021 and 2020 and concluded in each year that\nno\nimpairments exist.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nNOTE 9 -\nCAPITAL STOCK\nThe aggregate number of shares of all classes of stock which we are authorized to issue is up to\n1,000,500,000\n, divided into two classes consisting of\n500,000\nshares of $\n1\npar value preferred stock and\n1,000,000,000\nshares of common stock with a par value of $\n0.10\n.\nNo\nshares of preferred stock were outstanding on December 31, 2021.\nWe made no repurchases of shares in 2021. The manner, timing and amount of repurchases are determined by management based on an evaluation of market conditions, stock price and other factors and are subject to regulatory considerations. Purchases are made from time-to-time in the open market, in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise. On December 31, 2021 the total dollar value of shares that could be purchased under our authorized repurchase program was $\n1,033\n.\nShares reserved for future compensation grants of our common stock were\n25\nmillion and\n28\nmillion on December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nStock Options\nWe measure the cost of employee stock options based on the grant-date fair value and recognize that cost using the straight-line method over the period in which a recipient is required to provide services in exchange for the options, typically the vesting period. The weighted-average fair value per share of options is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of options granted is based on the United States Treasury yield\ncurve in effect at the time of grant. Expected stock price volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock. The expected option life, representing the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding, is based on historical option exercise and employee termination data.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of options, which represents the cumulative difference between the fair market value of the underlying common stock and the option exercise prices, exercised was $\n253\n, $\n258\n, and $\n294\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019. Exercise prices for options outstanding ranged from $\n53.60\nto $\n270.94\non December 31, 2021. On December 31, 2021 there was $\n101\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock options granted under the long-term incentive plans; that cost is expected to be recognized over the weighted-average period of approximately\n1.5\nyears.\nOn December 31, 2021 there was $\n71\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested RSUs. That cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the weighted-average period of approximately\none year\n. The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted was $\n230.61\nand $\n208.96\nin 2021 and 2020. The fair value of RSUs and PSUs vested in 2021 was $\n63\nand $\n5\n. On December 31, 2021 there was $\n18\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested PSUs; the cost is expected to be recognized as expense over the weighted-average period of approximately\none year\n.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plans (ESPP)\nEmployees may participate in our ESPP provided they meet certain eligibility requirements. The purchase price for our common stock under the terms of the ESPP is defined as\n95\n% of the closing stock price on the last trading day of a purchase period. We issued\n183,964\nand\n209,837\nshares under the ESPP in 2021 and 2020.\nNOTE 10 -\nDEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nWe have lines of credit issued by various financial institutions that are available to fund our day-to-day operating needs. Certain of our credit facilities require us to comply with financial and other covenants. We were in compliance with all covenants on December 31, 2021.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nIn October 2021 we entered into a new revolving credit agreement that replaces our previous agreement dated August 19, 2016. The primary changes were to increase the aggregate principal amount of the facility by $\n750\nto $\n2,250\n, extend the maturity date to October 26, 2026, increase the leverage ratio to\n3.75\nand provide LIBOR replacement language.\nIn the first quarter of 2022, our Board of Directors approved an increase to the maximum amount of commercial paper that can be outstanding under our commercial paper program from $\n1,500\nto $\n2,250\n, with maturities up to\n397\ndays from the date of issuance. On December 31, 2021 there were\nno\nborrowings outstanding under our credit facility or commercial paper program.\nThe fair value of the senior unsecured notes was estimated using quoted interest rates, maturities and amounts of borrowings based on quoted active market prices and yields that took into account the underlying terms of the debt instruments. Substantially all of our debt is classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nIn March 2021 we repaid $\n750\nof senior unsecured notes with a coupon of\n2.625\n% that were due on March 15, 2021.\nIn June 2021 we repaid the $\n400\nterm loan that was due on November 10, 2023.\nInterest expense, including required fees incurred on outstanding debt and credit facilities that were included in other income (expense), net, totaled $\n337\n, $\n315\n, and $\n287\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nNOTE 11 -\nINCOME TAXES\nOur effective tax rate was\n12.6\n%,\n18.2\n% and\n18.7\n% for 2021, 2020 and 2019. The effective income tax rate for 2021 reflects the continued lower effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations, certain discrete tax benefits, the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual property between tax jurisdictions and the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. The effective\nincome tax rate for 2020 and 2019 reflects the tax effect related to the transfer of intellectual properties between tax jurisdictions, the effective income tax rates as a result of our European operations and the tax effect of future remittances of the undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries.\nInterest and penalties included in other income (expense), net were expense of ($\n23\n), ($\n35\n) and ($\n9\n) in 2021, 2020 and 2019. The United States federal deferred income tax benefit (expense) includes the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards of $\n283\n, $\n41\nand $\n50\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAccrued interest and penalties were $\n150\nand $\n133\non December 31, 2021 and 2020 which were reported in current and noncurrent accrued expenses and other liabilities.\nNet operating loss carryforwards totaling $\n602\nwith $\n192\nbeing subject to a full valuation allowance ($\n183\nand $\n106\nrelated to the Wright acquisition) on December 31, 2021 are available to reduce future taxable earnings of certain domestic and foreign\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nsubsidiaries. United States loss carryforwards of $\n403\nexpire through 2045. International loss carryforwards of $\n198\nbegin to expire in 2022; however, some have no expiration. We also have tax credit carryforwards of $\n104\nwith $\n83\nbeing subject to a full valuation allowance. The credits with a full valuation allowance begin to expire in 2022; however, some have no expiration. We do not anticipate generating income tax in excess of the non-expiring credits in the foreseeable future.\nThe Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Act\") was enacted in 2017 in the United States. We recorded a one-time transition tax on earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries that were previously deferred. The Act also subjects a United States shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to account for GILTI tax in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe recorded deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries not determined to be indefinitely reinvested. Determination of the total amount of unrecognized deferred income tax on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries is not practicable.\nOur income tax expense would have been reduced by $\n445\nand $\n456\nin 2021 and 2020 had these uncertain income tax positions been favorably resolved. It is reasonably possible that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly change due to one or more of the following events in the next 12 months: expiring statutes, audit activity, tax payments, competent authority proceedings related to transfer pricing or final decisions in matters that are the subject of controversy in various taxing jurisdictions in which we operate, including inventory transfer pricing, cost sharing, product royalty and foreign branch arrangements. We are not able to reasonably estimate the amount or the future periods in which changes in unrecognized tax benefits may be resolved. Interest and penalties incurred associated with uncertain tax positions are included in other income (expense), net.\nIn the normal course of business, income tax authorities in various income tax jurisdictions both within the United States and internationally conduct routine audits of our income tax returns filed in prior years. These audits are generally designed to determine if individual income tax authorities are in agreement with our interpretations of complex income tax regulations regarding the allocation of income to the various income tax jurisdictions. Income tax years are open from 2014 through the current year for the United States federal jurisdiction. Income tax years open for our other major jurisdictions range from 2006 through the current year.\nNOTE 12 -\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe provide certain employees with defined contribution plans and other types of retirement plans. A portion of our retirement plan expense under the defined contribution plans is funded with Stryker common stock. The use of Stryker common stock\nrepresents a non-cash operating activity that is not reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nDefined Benefit Plans\nCertain of our subsidiaries have both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans covering some or all of their employees. Substantially all of the defined benefit pension plans have projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rates were selected using a hypothetical portfolio of high quality bonds on December 31 that would provide the necessary cash flows to match our projected benefit payments.\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined by applying the target allocation in each asset category of plan investments to the anticipated return for each asset category based on historical and projected returns.\nThe actuarial gain (loss) for all pension plans was primarily related to a change in the discount rate used to measure the benefit obligations of those plans.\nInvestment Strategy\nThe investment strategy for our defined benefit pension plans is to meet the liabilities of the plans as they fall due and to maximize the return on invested assets within appropriate risk tolerances.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nOur Level 3 pension plan assets consist primarily of guaranteed investment contracts with insurance companies. The insurance contracts guarantee us principal repayment and a fixed rate of return. The $\n5\ndecrease in Level 3 pension plan assets is primarily driven by the change in the corresponding pension liability. We expect to contribute $\n21\nto our defined benefit pension plans in 2022.\nNOTE 13 -\nSUMMARY OF QUARTERLY DATA (UNAUDITED)\nNOTE 14 -\nSEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA\nEffective December 31, 2021 we segregate our operations into\ntwo\nreportable business segments: (i) MedSurg and Neurotechnology and (ii) Orthopaedics and Spine. This change realigns the Company's reportable business segments to its new internal reporting structure and how the Company manages its businesses as a result of the transition of responsibilities of our President and Chief Operating Officer, and the division of responsibilities between Group President, MedSurg and Neurotechnology, and Group President, Orthopaedics and Spine, in the fourth quarter of 2021. We have reflected these changes in all historical periods presented.\nThe Corporate and Other category shown in the table below includes corporate and administration, corporate initiatives and share-based compensation, which includes compensation related to employee stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock unit grants and director stock options and restricted stock unit grants.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nWe measure the financial results of our reportable segments using an internal performance measure that excludes acquisition and integration-related charges, restructuring-related charges, reserves for certain product recall matters and reserves for certain legal and regulatory matters. Identifiable assets are those assets used exclusively in the operations of each business segment or allocated when used jointly. Corporate assets are principally property, plant and equipment and noncurrent assets.\nThe countries in which we have local revenue generating operations have been combined into the following geographic areas: the United States (including Puerto Rico); Europe, Middle East, Africa; Asia Pacific; and other foreign countries, which include Canada and countries in the Latin American region. Net sales are reported based on the geographic area of the Stryker location where the sales to the customer originated.\nNOTE 15 -\nASSET IMPAIRMENTS\nThe government in China has launched regional and national programs for volume-based procurement (\"VBP\") of high-value medical consumables to reduce healthcare costs. Each VBP program has specific requirements to award contracts to the lowest bidders who are able to satisfy the quality and quantity requirements. The successful bidders may be guaranteed sales volume for certain products, while unsuccessful bidders may lose unit sales volume. We expect that the prices required for a successful bid will, nevertheless, negatively impact our existing commercial operations of joint replacement and trauma products in China. As a result of the outcome of certain regional programs for our trauma products and the national VBP program for hips and knees we recorded charges of $\n105\nto impair certain long-lived and intangible assets in the third quarter of 2021. These charges were included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Spine products are part of the VBP program in one province and it is not clear to what extent spine products will be included in further provincial or national VBP programs. We do not expect any significant impairments related to the potential Spine VBP programs. Our business in China represented approximately\n2.5\n% of our revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAside from the impairments from the VBP programs, we recorded asset impairments of $\n159\nin 2021 consisting primarily of in-\nprocess research and development, other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment as a result of COVID-19-related demand impacts on in-process product development and certain other divestiture and restructuring activities.\nIn 2020 we suspended certain in-process investments resulting in charges of $\n195\nto impair certain long-lived assets (primarily the portion of our investment in a new global ERP system that was in-process of being developed for future deployment) and product line and other exit costs. These charges were included in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses\n.\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K"

Based on that evaluation, the Certifying Officers concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2021.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere was no change to our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of 2021 that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nMANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe Company's management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f). The Company's internal control over financial reporting was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Company's management and Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and includes those policies and procedures that: (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company's assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nThe Company's management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting on December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on this assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nStryker’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an audit report on their assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Stryker Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Stryker Corporation and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and our report dated February 11, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s\nSTRYKER CORPORATION                                                                                                                         2021 FORM 10-K\nassets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/    ERNST & YOUNG LLP\nGrand Rapids, Michigan\nFebruary 11, 2022"
