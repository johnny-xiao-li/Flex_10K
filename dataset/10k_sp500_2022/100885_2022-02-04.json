    "text": "GENERAL\nUnion Pacific Railroad Company is the principal operating company of Union Pacific Corporation. One of America's most recognized companies, Union Pacific Railroad Company connects 23 states in the western two-thirds of the country by rail, providing a critical link in the global supply chain. The Railroad’s diversified business mix includes Bulk, Industrial, and Premium. Union Pacific serves many of the fastest-growing U.S. population centers, operates from all major West Coast and Gulf Coast ports to eastern gateways, connects with Canada's rail systems, and is the only railroad serving all six major Mexico gateways. Union Pacific provides value to its roughly 10,000 customers by delivering products in a safe, reliable, fuel-efficient, and environmentally responsible manner.\nUnion Pacific Corporation was incorporated in Utah in 1969 and maintains its principal executive offices at 1400 Douglas Street, Omaha, NE 68179. The telephone number at that address is (402) 544-5000. The common stock of Union Pacific Corporation is listed on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) under the symbol “UNP”.\nFor purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to “UPC”, “Corporation”, “Company”, “we”, “us”, and “our” shall mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which we separately refer to as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.\nSTRATEGY\nThe Company’s growth strategy focuses on growing customer value through innovative supply chain solutions and aspiring to Serve, Grow, Win – Together.\nServe:\nDriving operational excellence to create a safer, more reliable and efficient service product. Precision scheduled railroading (PSR) is the foundation for delivering customer-centered operational excellence by:\nWe aim to move cars faster and reduce the number of times each car is touched, resulting in terminal consolidation opportunities, improved asset utilization, and fewer car classifications, which in turn leads to products getting to the market quicker and more reliably. The result is a better customer experience, which enables us to grow our market share.\nGrow:\nBy harnessing the potential of the best rail franchise in the industry, we expect to generate growth in three ways – increasing profitable carloads that fit our network and transportation plan; providing more products and services to create value for our customers; and increasing the geographic reach of our franchise through innovative supply chain solutions.\nWin:\nDriving strong financial performance resulting in significant shareholder returns. Execution of our plans to both serve and grow, leads to higher revenues with improved margins and greater cash generation, creating long term enterprise value.\nTogether:\nEngaging our four stakeholder groups – Communities, Customers, Employees, and Shareholders. Our comprehensive approach to Environmental Social Governance (ESG) issues, “Building a Sustainable Future 2030,” is designed to address the evolving needs of our stakeholders and is built on four areas of concentration – Investing in our Workforce, Driving Sustainable Solutions, Championing Environmental Stewardship, and Strengthening our Communities – to align with our stakeholder groups.\nWe believe that operational excellence and an engaged workforce with deep market knowledge and strong customer relationships will support best-in-class safety, a customer experience that drives growth, and shareholder returns.\nAs we work to transform our railroad into the safest, most reliable, and most efficient in North America, our values will continue guiding us. Our passion for performance will help us win; our high ethical standards will lead us to win in a way that supports all of our stakeholders; and our teamwork will make sure we win together.\nOPERATIONS\nThe Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable operating segment. Although we provide revenue by commodity group, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Additional information regarding our business and operations, including revenues, financial information and data, and other information regarding environmental matters, is presented in Risk Factors, Item 1A; Legal Proceedings, Item 3; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7; and the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8 (which include information regarding revenues, statements of income, and total assets).\n5\nBulk\n– The Company's Bulk shipments consist of grain and grain products, fertilizer, food and refrigerated, and coal and renewables. In 2021, this group generated 33% of our freight revenues. We access most major grain markets, connecting the Midwest and Western U.S. producing areas to export terminals in the Pacific Northwest and Gulf Coast ports as well as Mexico. We also serve significant domestic markets, including grain processors, animal feeders, and ethanol producers in the Midwest and West. Fertilizer movements originate in the Gulf Coast region, Midwest, western U.S., and Canada (through interline access) for delivery to major agricultural users in those areas as well as abroad. The Railroad’s network supports the transportation of coal shipments to independent and regulated power companies and industrial facilities throughout the U.S. Through interchange gateways and ports, UPRR’s reach extends to eastern U.S. utilities as well as to Mexico and other international destinations. Coal traffic originating in the Powder River Basin (PRB) area of Wyoming is the largest portion of the Railroad’s coal business. Renewable shipments for customers committed to sustainability consist primarily of biomass exports and wind turbine components.\nIndustrial\n– Our extensive network facilitates the movement of numerous commodities between thousands of origin and destination points throughout North America. The Industrial group consists of several categories, including construction, industrial chemicals, plastics, forest products, specialized products (primarily waste, salt, and roofing), metals and ores, petroleum, liquid petroleum gases (LPG), soda ash, and sand. Transportation of these products accounted for 36% of our freight revenues in 2021. Commercial, residential, and governmental infrastructure investments drive shipments of steel, aggregates, cement, and wood products. Industrial and light manufacturing plants receive steel, nonferrous materials, minerals, and other raw materials.\nThe industrial chemicals market consists of a vast number of chemical compounds that support the manufacturing of more complex chemicals. Plastics shipments support automotive, housing, and the durable and disposable consumer goods markets. Forest product shipments include lumber and paper commodities. Lumber shipments originate primarily in the Pacific Northwest or western Canada and move throughout the U.S. for use in new home construction and repairs and remodeling. Paper shipments primarily support packaging needs. Oil and gas drilling generates demand for raw steel, finished pipe, stone, and drilling fluid commodities. The Company’s petroleum and LPG shipments are primarily impacted by refinery utilization rates, regional crude pricing differentials, pipeline capacity, and the use of asphalt for road programs. Soda ash originates in southwestern Wyoming and California, destined for chemical and glass producing markets in North America and abroad.\nPremium\n– In 2021, Premium shipments generated 31% of Union Pacific’s total freight revenues. Premium includes finished automobiles, automotive parts, and merchandise in intermodal containers, both domestic and international. International business consists of import and export traffic moving in 20 or 40-foot shipping containers, that mainly pass through West Coast ports, destined for one of the Company's many inland intermodal terminals. Domestic business includes container and trailer traffic picked up and delivered within North America for intermodal marketing companies (primarily shipper agents and logistics companies) as well as truckload carriers.\nWe are the largest automotive carrier west of the Mississippi River and operate or access 38 vehicle distribution centers. The Railroad’s extensive franchise serves five vehicle assembly plants and connects to West Coast ports, all six major Mexico gateways, and the Port of Houston to accommodate both import and export shipments. In addition to transporting finished vehicles, the Company provides expedited handling of automotive parts in both boxcars and intermodal containers destined for Mexico, the U.S., and Canada.\nSeasonality\n– Some of the commodities we carry have peak shipping seasons, reflecting either or both the nature of the commodity (such as certain agricultural and food products that have specific growing and harvesting seasons) and the demand cycle for the commodity (such as intermodal traffic that generally peaks during the third quarter to meet back-to-school and holiday-related demand for consumer goods during the fourth quarter). The peak shipping seasons for these commodities can vary considerably each year depending upon various factors, including the strength of domestic and international economies and currencies; consumer demand; the strength of harvests, which can be adversely affected by severe weather; and market prices for agricultural products.\nProud & Engaged Workforce\n– Safety is a top priority at Union Pacific. We continue to improve technology, enhance processes, and foster a culture focused on operating safely, remaining focused on identifying and managing risks, and training our employees. Our success is measured by our personal injury rate (the number of reportable injuries for every 200,000 employee-hours worked), and our equipment incident rate (the number of reportable equipment incidents per million train miles). We provide both measures to the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA). Personal injuries are defined as on duty incidents or occupational illnesses that require employees to lose time away from work, modify their normal duties, or receive certain types of medical treatment. Equipment incidents are defined as any occurrence that causes damage to assets above the monetary reporting threshold regardless of ownership ($11,200 for 2021 and $11,300 for 2022).\n6\nOur goal is to have every employee return home safely every day. Our 2021 personal injury rate of 0.98 and equipment incident rate of 3.80 did not meet expectations and illustrates that we have work to do to achieve an incident-free environment. Our 2021 personal injury rate increased 9% and our equipment incident rate increased 7% versus 2020. (See further discussion in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, of this report.)\nWe recruit and develop talented individuals dedicated to our mission of service and who are passionate about performing to the best of their abilities while working as one team. We value people from all backgrounds and walks of life, and we empower employees to launch and grow their career within the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company employed\n32,124\ne\nmployees.\nWe believe a diverse workforce provides access to the skills and character we need to foster innovative ideas and drive optimal business growth. Drawing on different experiences and expertise is critical for strategic decision-making, problem-solving, leadership development, and creativity.\nUnion Pacific’s commitment, today and for the future, is to further improve and strengthen performance through an inclusive workforce that reflects the diverse markets and communities we serve, where everyone is treated fairly, and differences are valued. To that end, Union Pacific established a goal to reach 40% people of color and 11% female representation in our workforce by 2030. As of December 31, 2021, workforce representation of people of color and females was approximately 31.3% and 5.3%, respectively.\nProviding employees with meaningful work and fulfilling careers is important to us. We offer competitive compensation to our employees. We believe employees are more productive when their financial success is aligned with the Company's success. In May 2021, our shareholders approved our employee stock purchase plan (ESPP), allowing participants to receive a 40% Company match of up to 5% of their base compensation (limited to $15,000 annually) to purchase shares in the Company stock. Our Board of Directors evaluates our non-union compensation plans and reviews recommendations from the Compensation and Benefits Committee, while collective bargaining agreements govern compensation for our union employees. The median annual compensation for all employees employed as of December 31, 2021, was $81,179 (excluding the CEO).\nLabor Agreements\n– Approximately 84% of our full-time employees are represented by 13 major rail unions. Pursuant to the Railway Labor Act (RLA), our collective bargaining agreements are subject to modification every five years. Existing agreements remain in effect until new agreements are ratified or until the RLA procedures are exhausted. The RLA procedures include mediation, potential arbitration, cooling-off periods, and the possibility of Presidential Emergency Boards and Congressional intervention. The current round of negotiations began on January 1, 2020, related to years 2020-2024, and all collective bargaining groups are currently in the mediation phase. Contract negotiations historically continue for an extended period of time, and work stoppages during negotiations are rare (see “\nStrikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations\n” in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report).\nRailroad Security\n– Our security efforts consist of a wide variety of measures, including employee training, engagement with our customers, training of emergency responders, and partnerships with numerous federal, state, and local government agencies. While federal law requires us to protect the confidentiality of our security plans designed to safeguard against terrorism and other security incidents, the following provides a general overview of our security initiatives.\nUPRR Security Measures\n– We maintain a comprehensive security plan designed to both deter and respond to any potential or actual threats as they arise. The plan includes four levels of alert status, each with its own set of countermeasures. We employ our own police force, consisting of commissioned and highly-trained officers. The police are certified state law enforcement officers with investigative and arrest powers. The Union Pacific Police Department has achieved accreditation under the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies, Inc. (CALEA) for complying with the highest law enforcement standards. Our employees undergo recurrent security and preparedness training as well as federally mandated hazardous materials and security training. We regularly review the sufficiency of our employee training programs. We maintain the capability to move critical operations to back-up facilities in different locations.\nWe operate an emergency response management center 24 hours a day. The center receives reports of emergencies, dangerous or potentially dangerous conditions, and other safety and security issues from our employees, the public, law enforcement, and other government officials. In cooperation with government officials, we monitor both threats and public events, and, as necessary, we may alter rail traffic flow at times of concern to minimize risk to communities and our operations. We comply with the hazardous materials routing rules and other requirements imposed by federal law. We design our operating plan to expedite the movement of hazardous material shipments to minimize the time rail cars remain idle at yards and terminals located in or near major population centers. Additionally, in compliance with Transportation Security Agency regulations, we deployed information systems and instructed employees in tracking and documenting the handoff of Rail Security Sensitive Materials with customers and interchange partners.\nWe established a number of our own innovative safety and security-oriented initiatives ranging from various investments in technology to The Officer on Train program, which provides local law enforcement officers with the opportunity to ride with train crews to enhance their understanding of railroad operations and risks. Our staff of information security professionals continually assess cybersecurity risks and implement mitigation programs that evolve with the changing technology threat environment. For example, we released critical patches to address the vulnerability in Log4J, a component widely used in our applications and found in commercial software. To date, we have not experienced any material disruption of our operations due to a cyber threat or attack directed at us.\nCooperation with Federal, State, and Local Government Agencies\n– We work closely on physical and cybersecurity initiatives with government agencies, including the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT); the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), along with its Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA); as well as local police departments, fire departments, and other first responders. In connection with new guidance from the TSA, effective January 1, 2022, we are required to report cyber incidents to CISA, perform a cyber vulnerability self-assessment and submit results to the TSA (by March 31, 2022), assemble and adopt a cyber incident response plan (by June 29, 2022), and appoint cybersecurity coordinators. In conjunction with the Association of American Railroads (AAR), we sponsor Ask Rail, a mobile application that provides first responders with secure links to electronic information, including commodity and emergency response information required by emergency personnel to respond to accidents and other situations. We also participate in the National Joint Terrorism Task Force, a multi-agency effort established by the U.S. Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to combat and prevent terrorism.\n7\nWe work with the Coast Guard, U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and the Military Transport Management Command, which monitor shipments entering the UPRR rail network at U.S. border crossings and ports. We were the first railroad in the U.S. to be named a partner in CBP’s Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism, a partnership designed to develop, enhance, and maintain effective security processes throughout the global supply chain.\nCooperation with Customers and Trade Associations\n– Through TransCAER (Transportation Community Awareness and Emergency Response), we work with the AAR, the American Chemistry Council, the American Petroleum Institute, and other chemical trade groups to provide communities with preparedness tools, including the training of emergency responders. In cooperation with the FRA and other interested groups, we are also working to develop additional improvements to tank car design that will further limit the risk of releases of hazardous materials.\nSustainable Future\n– Union Pacific believes it is important that we act as environmental stewards, reducing emissions and supporting the transition to a more sustainable future. While we work to further reduce our environmental footprint, it is important to note that railroads already are one of the most fuel-efficient means of transportation. According to the Association of American Railroads (AAR), moving freight by rail instead of truck reduces greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by up to 75%. Building on rail’s relative emissions benefits over other modes of transportation, we are taking additional actions to reduce our emissions. These actions are described in our initial Climate Action Plan, which we released in December 2021.\nCompetition\n– see “\nWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers\n” in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nKey Suppliers\n– see “\nWe Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail\n” in the Risk Factors in Item 1A of this report.\nAvailable Information\n– Our Internet website is www.up.com. We make available free of charge on our website (under the “Investors” caption link) our Annual Reports on Form 10-K; our Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q; our current reports on Form 8-K; our proxy statements; Forms 3, 4, and 5, filed on behalf of our directors and certain executive officers; and amendments to such reports filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the Exchange Act). We provide these reports and statements as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC. We also make available on our website previously filed SEC reports and exhibits via a link to EDGAR on the SEC’s Internet site at www.sec.gov. Additionally, our corporate governance materials, including By-Laws, Board Committee charters, governance guidelines and policies, and codes of conduct and ethics for directors, officers, and employees are available on our website. From time to time, the corporate governance materials on our website may be updated as necessary to comply with rules issued by the SEC and the NYSE or as desirable to promote the effective and efficient governance of our Company. Any security holder wishing to receive, without charge, a copy of any of our SEC filings or corporate governance materials should send a written request to: Secretary, Union Pacific Corporation, 1400 Douglas Street, Omaha, NE 68179.\nReferences to our website address in this report, including references in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, are provided as a convenience and do not constitute, and should not be deemed, an incorporation by reference of the information contained on, or available through, the website. Therefore, such information should not be considered part of this report.\nGOVERNMENTAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION\nGovernmental Regulation\n– Our operations are subject to a variety of federal, state, and local regulations, generally applicable to all businesses. (See also the discussion of certain regulatory proceedings in Legal Proceedings, Item 3.)\nThe operations of the Railroad are subject to the regulations of the FRA and other federal and state agencies as well as the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (STB). The STB has jurisdiction over rates charged on certain regulated rail traffic; common carrier service of regulated traffic; freight car compensation; transfer, extension, or abandonment of rail lines; and acquisition of control of rail common carriers. The STB continues its efforts to explore expanding rail regulation and is reviewing proposed rulemaking in various areas, including reciprocal switching, commodity exemptions, and expanding and easing procedures for smaller rate complaints. The STB also continues to explore changes to the methodology for determining railroad revenue adequacy and the possible uses of revenue adequacy in regulating railroad rates. The STB posts quarterly reports on rate reasonableness cases, maintains a database on service complaints, and has the authority to initiate investigations, among other things.\nDOT, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, and DHS, along with other federal agencies, have jurisdiction over certain aspects of safety, movement of hazardous materials and hazardous waste, emissions requirements, and equipment standards. Additionally, various state and local agencies have jurisdiction over disposal of hazardous waste and seek to regulate movement of hazardous materials in ways not preempted by federal law.\nEnvironmental Regulation\n– We are subject to extensive federal and state environmental statutes and regulations pertaining to public health and the environment. The statutes and regulations are administered and monitored by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and by various state environmental agencies. The primary laws affecting our operations are the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, regulating the management and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes; the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, regulating the cleanup of contaminated properties; the Clean Air Act, regulating air emissions; and the Clean Water Act, regulating wastewater discharges.\nInformation concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates– Environmental, Item 7, and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\n8"

    "text": "The following discussion addresses significant factors, events, and uncertainties that make an investment in our securities risky and provides important information for the understanding of our “forward-looking statements,” which are discussed immediately preceding Item 7A of this Form 10-K and elsewhere. The risk factors set forth in this Item 1A should be read in conjunction with the rest of the information included in this report, including Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, Item 7, and Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nWe urge you to consider carefully the factors described below and the risks that they present for our operations as well as the risks addressed in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K. When the factors, events, and contingencies described below or elsewhere in this Form 10-K materialize, our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, or prospects can be materially adversely affected. In such case, the trading price of our common stock could decline and you could lose part or all of your investment. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and prospects.\nStrategic and Operational Risks\nWe Must Manage Fluctuating Demand for Our Services and Network Capacity\n– Significant reductions in demand for rail services with respect to one or more commodities or changes in consumer preferences that affect the businesses of our customers can lead to increased costs associated with resizing our operations, including higher unit operating costs and costs for the storage of locomotives, rail cars, and other equipment; work-force adjustments; and other related activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. If there is significant demand for our services that exceeds the designed capacity of our network, we may experience network difficulties, including congestion and reduced velocity, that could compromise the level of service we provide to our customers. This level of demand may also compound the impact of weather and weather-related events on our operations and velocity. Although we continue to improve our transportation plan, add capacity, improve operations at our yards and other facilities, and improve our ability to address surges in demand for any reason with adequate resources, we cannot be sure that these measures will fully or adequately address any service shortcomings resulting from demand exceeding our planned capacity. We may experience other operational or service difficulties related to network capacity, dramatic and unplanned fluctuations in our customers’ demand for rail service with respect to one or more commodities or operating regions, or other events that could negatively impact our operational efficiency, which could all have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe Transport Hazardous Materials\n– We transport certain hazardous materials and other materials, including crude oil, ethanol, and toxic inhalation hazard (TIH) materials, such as chlorine, that pose certain risks in the event of a release or combustion. Additionally, U.S. laws impose common carrier obligations on railroads that require us to transport certain hazardous materials regardless of risk or potential exposure to loss. A rail accident or other incident or accident on our network, at our facilities, or at the facilities of our customers involving the release or combustion of hazardous materials could involve significant costs and claims for personal injury, property damage, and environmental penalties and remediation in excess of our insurance coverage for these risks, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe Rely on Technology and Technology Improvements in Our Business Operations\n– We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us or under control of third-parties. If we do not have sufficient capital or do not deploy sufficient capital in a timely manner to acquire, develop, or implement new technology or maintain or upgrade current systems, such as Positive Train Control (PTC) or the latest version of our transportation control systems, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage within the rail industry and with companies providing other modes of transportation service, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe Are Subject to Cybersecurity Risks\n– We rely on information technology in all aspects of our business, including technology systems operated by us (whether created by us or purchased), under control of third-parties, or open-source software. Although we devote significant resources to protect our technology systems and proprietary data, we have experienced and will likely continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal course of business. There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur. Furthermore, due to the rising numbers and increasing sophistication of cyber-attacks, an increasingly complex information technology supply chain, and the nature of zero-day exploits, we may be unable to anticipate or implement adequate preventative measures to prevent a security breach, including by ransomware, human error, or other cyber-attack methods, from materially disrupting our systems or the systems of third-parties. A successful cyber-attack may result in significant service interruption; safety failure; other operational difficulties; unauthorized access to (or the loss of access to) competitively sensitive, confidential, or other critical data or systems; loss of customers; financial losses; regulatory fines; and misuse or corruption of critical data and proprietary information, which could all have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. We may experience security breaches that could remain undetected for an extended period and, therefore, have a greater impact on the services we offer. Additionally, we may be exposed to increased cybersecurity risk because we are a component of the critical U.S. infrastructure.\nSevere Weather Could Result in Significant Business Interruptions and Expenditures\n– As a railroad with a vast network, we are exposed to severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, mudslides or landslides, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation. Line outages and other interruptions caused by these conditions can adversely affect our entire rail network, potentially negatively affecting revenue, costs, and liabilities, despite efforts we undertake to plan for these events. Our revenues can also be adversely affected by severe weather that causes damage and disruptions to our customers. These impacts caused by severe weather could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n9\nA Significant Portion of Our Revenue Involves Transportation of Commodities to and from International Markets\n– Although revenues from our operations are attributable to transportation services provided in the U.S., a significant portion of our revenues involves the transportation of commodities to and from international markets, including Mexico, Canada, and Southeast Asia, by various carriers and, at times, various modes of transportation. Significant and sustained interruptions of trade with Mexico, Canada, or countries in Southeast Asia, including China, could adversely affect customers and other entities that, directly or indirectly, purchase or rely on rail transportation services in the U.S. as part of their operations, and any such interruptions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Any one or more of the following could cause a significant and sustained interruption of trade with Mexico, Canada, or countries in Southeast Asia: (a) a deterioration of security for international trade and businesses; (b) the adverse impact of new laws, rules, and regulations or the interpretation of laws, rules, and regulations by government entities, courts, or regulatory bodies, including the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) and a “Phase One” trade agreement with China; (c) actions of taxing authorities that affect our customers doing business in foreign countries; (d) any significant adverse economic developments, such as extended periods of high inflation, material disruptions in the banking sector or in the capital markets of these foreign countries, and significant changes in the valuation of the currencies of these foreign countries that could materially affect the cost or value of imports or exports; (e) shifts in patterns of international trade that adversely affect import and export markets; (f) a material reduction in foreign direct investment in these countries; and (g) public health crises, including the outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, such as the coronavirus and its variant strains (COVID).\nWe Are Dependent on Certain Key Suppliers of Locomotives and Rail\n– Due to the capital-intensive nature and sophistication of locomotive equipment, parts, and maintenance, potential new suppliers face high barriers to entry. Therefore, if one of the domestic suppliers of high horsepower locomotives discontinues manufacturing locomotives, supplying parts, or providing maintenance for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency or the inability to manufacture locomotives that meet efficiency or regulatory emissions standards, we could experience significant cost increases and reduced availability of the locomotives that are necessary for our operations. Additionally, we utilize a limited number of steel producers that meet our specifications. Rail is critical to our operations for rail replacement programs, maintenance, and for adding additional network capacity, new rail and storage yards, and expansions of existing facilities. This industry similarly has high barriers to entry, and if one of these suppliers discontinues operations for any reason, including bankruptcy or insolvency, we could experience both significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail for maintenance and other projects. Changes to trade agreements or policies that result in increased tariffs on goods imported into the United States could also result in significant cost increases for rail purchases and difficulty obtaining sufficient rail.\nHuman Capital Risks\nStrikes or Work Stoppages Could Adversely Affect Our Operations\n– The U.S. Class I railroads are party to collective bargaining agreements with various labor unions. The majority of our employees belong to labor unions and are subject to these agreements. Disputes over the terms of these agreements or our potential inability to negotiate acceptable contracts with these unions could result in, among other things, strikes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts, which could cause a significant disruption of our operations and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Additionally, future national labor agreements, or renegotiation of labor agreements or provisions of labor agreements, could compromise our service reliability or significantly increase our costs for health care, wages, and other benefits, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts at loading/unloading facilities, ports, or other transport access points could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Labor disputes, work stoppages, slowdowns, or lockouts by employees of our customers or our suppliers could compromise our service reliability and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nThe Availability of Qualified Personnel Could Adversely Affect Our Operations\n– Changes in demographics, training requirements, and the availability of qualified personnel for us, our customers, and throughout the supply chain, including the effects on availability from pandemic illnesses or restrictions (including, for example, any potential effects from the coronavirus vaccine mandates), could negatively affect our ability to meet demand for rail service. Unpredictable increases in demand for rail services and a lack of network fluidity may exacerbate such risks, which could have a negative impact on our operational efficiency and otherwise have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nWe Are Subject to Significant Governmental Regulation\n– We are subject to governmental regulation by a significant number of federal, state, and local authorities covering a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental, economic (as discussed below), tax, and other matters. Many laws and regulations require us to obtain and maintain various licenses, permits, and other authorizations, and we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be able to do so. Our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on us. Governments or regulators may change the legislative or regulatory frameworks that we operate in without providing us any recourse to address any adverse effects on our business, including, without limitation, regulatory determinations or rules regarding dispute resolution, increasing the amount of our traffic subject to common carrier regulation, business relationships with other railroads, calculation of our cost of capital or other inputs relevant to computing our revenue adequacy, the prices we charge, changes in tax rates, enactment of new tax laws, and revision in tax regulations. Significant legislative activity in Congress or regulatory activity by the STB could expand regulation of railroad operations and pricing for rail services, which could reduce capital spending on our rail network, facilities, and equipment, and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures\n– As a railroad with operations in densely populated urban areas and a vast rail network, we are exposed to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, environmental liability, and other matters. Any material changes to litigation trends or a catastrophic rail accident or series of accidents involving any or all of property damage, personal injury, and environmental liability that exceed our insurance coverage for such risks could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\n10\nWe Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations\n– Due to the nature of the railroad business, our operations are subject to extensive federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air; discharges to waters; handling, storage, transportation, and disposal of waste and other materials; and hazardous material or petroleum releases. We generate and transport hazardous and non-hazardous waste in our operations. Environmental liability can extend to previously owned or operated properties, leased properties, properties owned by third-parties, as well as properties we currently own. Environmental liabilities have arisen and may also arise from claims asserted by adjacent landowners or other third-parties in toxic tort litigation. We have been and may be subject to allegations or findings that we have violated, or are strictly liable under, these laws or regulations. We currently have certain obligations at existing sites for investigation, remediation, and monitoring, and we likely will have obligations at other sites in the future. Liabilities for these obligations affect our estimate based on our experience and, as necessary, the advice and assistance of our consultants. However, actual costs may vary from our estimates due to any or all of several factors, including changes to environmental laws or interpretations of such laws, technological changes affecting investigations and remediation, the participation and financial viability of other parties responsible for any such liability, and the corrective action or change to corrective actions required to remediate any existing or future sites. We could incur significant costs as a result of any of the foregoing, and we may be required to incur significant expenses to investigate and remediate known, unknown, or future environmental contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nMacroeconomic and Industry Risks\nWe Face Competition from Other Railroads and Other Transportation Providers\n– We face competition from other railroads, motor carriers, ships, barges, and pipelines. Our main railroad competitor is Burlington Northern Santa Fe LLC. Its primary subsidiary, BNSF Railway Company (BNSF), operates parallel routes in many of our main traffic corridors. In addition, we operate in corridors served by other railroads and motor carriers. Motor carrier competition exists for all three of our commodity groups (excluding most coal shipments). Because of the proximity of our routes to major inland and Gulf Coast waterways, barges can be particularly competitive, especially for grain and bulk commodities in certain areas where we operate. In addition to price competition, we face competition with respect to transit times, quality, and reliability of service from motor carriers and other railroads. Motor carriers in particular can have an advantage over railroads with respect to transit times and timeliness of service. However, railroads are much more fuel-efficient than trucks, which reduces the impact of transporting goods on the environment and public infrastructure, and we have been making efforts to convert truck traffic to rail. Additionally, we must build or acquire and maintain our rail system, while trucks, barges, and maritime operators are able to use public rights-of-way maintained by public entities. Any of the following could also affect the competitiveness of our transportation services for some or all of our commodities, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity: (i) improvements or expenditures materially increasing the quality or reducing the costs of these alternative modes of transportation, such as autonomous or more fuel efficient trucks, (ii) legislation that eliminates or significantly increases the size or weight limitations applied to motor carriers, or (iii) legislation or regulatory changes that impose operating restrictions on railroads or that adversely affect the profitability of some or all railroad traffic. Many movements face product or geographic competition where our customers can use different products (e.g., natural gas instead of coal, sorghum instead of corn) or commodities from different locations (e.g., grain from states or countries that we do not serve, crude oil from different regions). Sourcing different commodities or different locations allows shippers to substitute different carriers and such competition may reduce our volume or constrain prices. Additionally, any future consolidation of the rail industry could materially affect our competitive environment.\nWe May Be Affected by Climate Change and Market or Regulatory Responses to Climate Change\n– Climate change, including the impact of global warming, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Restrictions, caps, taxes, or other controls on emissions of GHGs, including diesel exhaust, could significantly increase our operating costs. Restrictions on emissions could also affect our customers that (a) use commodities that we carry to produce energy, (b) use significant amounts of energy in producing or delivering the commodities we carry, or (c) manufacture or produce goods that consume significant amounts of energy or burn fossil fuels, including chemical producers, farmers and food producers, and automakers and other manufacturers. Significant cost increases, government regulation, or changes of consumer preferences for goods or services relating to alternative sources of energy, emissions reductions, and GHG emissions could materially affect the markets for the commodities we carry and demand for our services, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Government incentives encouraging the use of alternative sources of energy also could affect certain of our customers and the markets for certain of the commodities we carry in an unpredictable manner that could alter our traffic patterns, including, for example, increasing royalties charged to producers of PRB coal by the U.S. Department of Interior and the impacts of ethanol incentives on farming and ethanol producers. We could face increased costs related to defending and resolving legal claims and other litigation related to climate change and the alleged impact of our operations on climate change. Violent weather caused by climate change, including earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, floods, extreme temperatures, avalanches, and significant precipitation could cause line outages and other interruptions to our infrastructure. Any of these factors, individually or in operation with one or more of the other factors, or other unforeseen impacts of climate change could reduce the amount of traffic we handle and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. While we work to implement our Climate Action Plan, our efforts to achieve emission reduction targets could significantly increase our operational costs and capital expenditures.\n11\nOur business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected, and in the future, could be materially adversely affected by pandemics or other public health crises\n– Our business, financial condition, and results of operations have been adversely affected by COVID. COVID has caused, and is expected to continue to cause, a global slowdown of economic activity (including the decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods), disruptions in global supply chains, and significant volatility and disruption of financial markets, resulting further in adverse effects on workforces, customers, and regional and local economies. Other future pandemics or public health crises may cause these same or similar consequences. Because the severity, magnitude, and duration of the COVID pandemic and its economic consequences are rapidly changing, and difficult to predict, the impact on our business and financial condition remains uncertain. The ultimate impact of the COVID pandemic on our results of operations and financial condition remains uncertain and depends on numerous evolving factors, which we may not be able to effectively respond to and are not entirely within our control. These factors also may be of importance for other pandemics or public health crises, including, but not limited to: governmental, business, and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to a global pandemic or other public health crises (including restrictions on travel and transport, workforce pressures, social distancing, and shelter-in-place orders); the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on economic activity and actions taken in response; the effect on our customers and their demand for our services; the effect of a pandemic or other public health crises on the credit-worthiness of our customers; national or global supply chain challenges or disruption; facility closures; commodity cost volatility; general economic uncertainty in key global markets and financial market volatility; global economic conditions and levels of economic growth; and the pace of recovery as the pandemic subsides as well as response to a potential reoccurrence. Further, a pandemic or other public health crises, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from such an event, could also precipitate and aggravate the other risk factors that we identify, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations (including revenues and profitability), and/or stock price. Additionally, a pandemic or other public health crises also may affect our operating and financial results in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations.\nFinancial Risks\nWe Are Affected By Fluctuating Fuel Prices\n– Fuel costs constitute a significant portion of our transportation expenses. Diesel fuel prices can be subject to dramatic fluctuations, and significant price increases could have a material adverse effect on our operating results. Although we currently are able to recover a significant amount of our fuel expenses from our customers through revenue from fuel surcharges, we cannot be certain that we will always be able to mitigate rising or elevated fuel costs through our fuel surcharges. Additionally, future market conditions or legislative or regulatory activities could adversely affect our ability to apply fuel surcharges or adequately recover increased fuel costs through fuel surcharges. As fuel prices fluctuate, our fuel surcharge programs trail such fluctuations in fuel price by approximately two months, and may be a significant source of quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year volatility, particularly in periods of rapidly changing prices. International, political, and economic factors, events and conditions affect the volatility of fuel prices and supplies. Weather can also affect fuel supplies and limit domestic refining capacity. A severe shortage of, or disruption to, domestic fuel supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. Alternatively, lower fuel prices could have a positive impact on the economy by increasing consumer discretionary spending that potentially could increase demand for various consumer products we transport. However, lower fuel prices could have a negative impact on other commodities we transport, such as coal and domestic drilling-related shipments, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity.\nWe Rely on Capital Markets\n– Due to the significant capital expenditures required to operate and maintain a safe and efficient railroad, we rely on the capital markets to provide some of our capital requirements. We utilize long-term debt instruments, bank financing, and commercial paper, and we pledge certain amount of our receivables as collateral for credit. Significant instability or disruptions of the capital markets, including the credit markets, or deterioration of our financial condition due to internal or external factors could restrict or prohibit our access to, and significantly increase the cost of, commercial paper and other financing sources, including bank credit facilities and the issuance of long-term debt, including corporate bonds. A significant deterioration of our financial condition could result in a reduction of our credit rating to below investment grade, which could restrict or, at certain credit levels below investment grade, may prohibit us from utilizing our current receivables securitization facility (Receivables Facility). This may also limit our access to external sources of capital and significantly increase the costs of short and long-term debt financing.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe Are Affected by General Economic Conditions\n– Prolonged, severe adverse domestic and global economic conditions or disruptions of financial and credit markets, including inflation, may affect the producers and consumers of the commodities we carry and may have a material adverse effect on our access to liquidity, results of operations, and financial condition.\nWe May Be Affected by Acts of Terrorism, War, or Risk of War\n– Our rail lines, facilities, and equipment, including rail cars carrying hazardous materials, could be direct targets or indirect casualties of terrorist attacks. Terrorist attacks, or other similar events, any government response thereto, and war or risk of war may adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. In addition, insurance premiums for some or all of our current coverages could increase dramatically, or certain coverages may not be available to us in the future."

    "text": "We employ a variety of assets in the management and operation of our rail business. Our rail network covers 23 states in the western two-thirds of the U.S.\nTRACK\nOur rail network includes 32,452 route miles. We own 26,124 miles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. The following table describes track miles at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nHEADQUARTERS BUILDING\nWe own our headquarters building in Omaha, Nebraska. The facility has 1.2 million square feet of space that can accommodate approximately 4,000 employees.\nHARRIMAN DISPATCHING CENTER\nThe Harriman Dispatching Center (HDC), located in Omaha, Nebraska, is our primary dispatching facility. It is linked to regional dispatching and locomotive management facilities at various locations along our network. HDC employees coordinate moves of locomotives and trains, manage traffic and train crews on our network, and coordinate interchanges with other railroads. More than 500 employees currently work on-site in the facility. In the event of a disruption of operations at HDC due to a cyber-attack, flooding or severe weather, pandemic outbreak, or other event, we maintain the capability to conduct critical operations at back-up facilities in different locations.\n13\nRAIL FACILITIES\nIn addition to our track structure, we operate numerous facilities, including terminals for intermodal and other freight; rail yards for building trains (classification yards), switching, storage-in-transit (the temporary storage of customer goods in rail cars prior to shipment), and other activities; offices to administer and manage our operations; dispatching centers to direct traffic on our rail network; crew on duty locations for train crews along our network; and shops and other facilities for fueling, maintenance, and repair of locomotives and repair and maintenance of rail cars and other equipment. The following table includes the major yards and terminals on our system:\nRAIL EQUIPMENT\nOur equipment includes owned and leased locomotives and rail cars; heavy maintenance equipment and machinery; other equipment and tools in our shops, offices, and facilities; and vehicles for maintenance, transportation of crews, and other activities. As of December 31, 2021, we owned or leased the following units of equipment:\nWe continuously assess our need for equipment to run an efficient and reliable network. Many factors cause us to adjust the size of our active fleets, including changes in carload volume, weather events, seasonality, customer preferences, and operational efficiency initiatives. As some of these factors are difficult to assess or can change rapidly, we maintain a surge fleet to remain agile. Without the surge fleet, our ability to react quickly is hindered as equipment suppliers are limited and lead times to acquire equipment are long and may be in excess of a year. We believe our locomotive and freight car fleets are appropriately sized to meet our current and future business requirements. These fleets serve as the most reliable and efficient equipment to facilitate growth without additional acquisitions. Locomotive and freight car in service utilization percentages for the year ended December 31, 2021, were 62% and 80%, respectively.\n14\nCAPITAL EXPENDITURES\nOur rail network requires significant annual capital investments for replacement, improvement, and expansion. These investments enhance safety, support the transportation needs of our customers, improve our operational efficiency, and support emission reduction initiatives outlined in our Climate Action Plan. Additionally, we add new equipment to our fleet to replace older equipment and to support growth and customer demand.\n2021 Capital Program\n– During 2021, our capital program totaled approximately $3.0 billion. (See the cash capital investments table in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 7, of this report.)\n2022 Capital Plan\n– In 2022, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up 10% from 2021. (See further discussion of our 2022 capital plan in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Liquidity and Capital Resources, Item 7, of this report.)\nOTHER\nEquipment Encumbrances\n– Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $1.2 billion and $1.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, served as collateral for finance leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire or refinance such railroad equipment.\nEnvironmental Matters\n– Certain of our properties are subject to federal, state, and local laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. (See discussion within this report of environmental issues in Business – Governmental and Environmental Regulation, Item 1; Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Environmental, Item 7; and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.)"

We routinely assess our liabilities and contingencies in connection with these matters based upon the latest available information, and, when necessary, we seek input from our third-party advisors when making these assessments. Consistent with SEC rules and requirements, we describe below material pending legal proceedings (other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business), material proceedings known to be contemplated by governmental authorities, other proceedings arising under federal, state, or local environmental laws and regulations (including governmental proceedings involving potential fines, penalties, or other monetary sanctions in excess of $1,000,000), and such other pending matters that we may determine to be appropriate.\nENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS\nWe receive notices from the EPA and state environmental agencies alleging that we are or may be liable under federal or state environmental laws for remediation costs at various sites throughout the U.S., including sites on the Superfund National Priorities List or state superfund lists. We cannot predict the ultimate impact of these proceedings and suits because of the number of potentially responsible parties involved, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs.\nInformation concerning environmental claims and contingencies and estimated remediation costs is set forth in this report in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Critical Accounting Estimates – Environmental, Item 7, and Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\n15\nOTHER MATTERS\nAntitrust Litigation\n– As we reported in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June 30, 2007, 20 rail shippers (many of whom were represented by the same law firms) filed virtually identical antitrust lawsuits in various federal district courts against us and four other Class I railroads in the U.S. Currently, UPRR and three other Class I railroads are the named defendants in the lawsuits. The original plaintiff filed the first of these claims in the U.S. District Court in New Jersey on May 14, 2007. These suits alleged that the named railroads engaged in price-fixing by establishing common fuel surcharges for certain rail traffic.\nOn August 16, 2019, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) affirmed the decision of U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (U.S. District Court) denying class certification (the Certification Denial). Only five plaintiffs remain in this multidistrict litigation (MDL) originally filed in 2007, which remains pending. They are proceeding on a consolidated basis in the U.S. District Court before the Honorable Paul L. Friedman (MDL I). Since the Certification Denial, approximately 111 lawsuits have been filed in federal court based on claims identical to those alleged in the class certification case. The Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation consolidated these suits for pretrial proceedings in the U.S. District Court before the Honorable Beryl A. Howell (MDL II).\nOn February 19, 2021, the court denied our motion to exclude plaintiffs' alleged evidence of conspiracy under a federal statute designed to incent and protect railroad communications made to further interline service (i.e., where two railroads are in the route). In August 2021, the D.C. Circuit agreed to hear Defendants' appeal. Oral argument is scheduled for March 7, 2022. The appeal will address whether the interline evidence the plaintiffs intend to utilize to prove the alleged conspiracy is admissible either for purposes of summary judgment or at trial.\nWe also filed a motion for summary judgment on May 14, 2021, in the MDL I proceedings, and the briefing was completed in September 2021. On October 20, 2021, Judge Friedman issued an order stating that he will not consider the motions for summary judgment until after the D.C. Circuit appeal mentioned above is decided.\nAs we reported in our Current Report on Form 8-K, filed on June 10, 2011, the Railroad received a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on June 7, 2011, by Oxbow Carbon & Minerals LLC and related entities (Oxbow). Just as it did in the MDL proceedings, Union Pacific filed a motion for summary judgment on May 14, 2021, and the briefing was completed in September 2021. As stated above, the court issued an order that will not consider the motions for summary judgment until after the D.C. Circuit appeal mentioned above is decided.\nWe continue to deny the allegations that our fuel surcharge programs violate the antitrust laws or any other laws. We believe that these lawsuits are without merit, and we will vigorously defend our actions. Therefore, we currently believe that these matters will not have a material adverse effect on any of our results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity."

The following section generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7, of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our one reportable business segment. Although revenue is analyzed by commodity, we analyze the net financial results of the Railroad as one segment due to the integrated nature of the rail network.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n2021 Results\n19\nFree cash flow is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in investing activities and dividends paid. Free cash flow is not considered a financial measure under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe free cash flow is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. Free cash flow should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities. The following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to free cash flow (non-GAAP measure):\n20\n2022 Outlook\n21\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Revenues\nWe generate freight revenues by transporting freight or other materials from our three commodity groups. Freight revenues vary with volume (carloads) and ARC. Changes in price, traffic mix, and fuel surcharges drive ARC. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available historical, current, and forecasted volumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied. We recognize freight revenues over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred.\nOther subsidiary revenues (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\nOur freight revenues increased 11% year-over-year to $20.2 billion driven by a 4% increase in volume, higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic (for example, a relative increase in industrial shipments, which have a higher ARC). Volume increased in every key market segment compared to 2020 due to the recovery from the depressed economy brought on by the COVID pandemic in 2020. While the markets have rebounded from 2020, our 2021 volume levels are 4% below 2019 pre-pandemic levels.\nOur fuel surcharge programs generated freight revenues of $1.7 billion and $1.0 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Fuel surcharge revenue in 2021 increased $0.7 billion as a result of a 49% increase in fuel price and a 4% increase in carloadings, partially offset by the lag impact on fuel surcharge (it can generally take up to two months for changing fuel prices to affect fuel surcharges recoveries).\nIn 2021, other subsidiary revenues were flat with 2020 as the semiconductor shortage negatively impacting 2021 automotive production offset the recovery from other COVID related declines in 2020. Accessorial revenue increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased intermodal accessorial charges tied to global supply chain disruptions. Other revenue was essentially flat year-over-year.\n22\nThe following tables summarize the year-over-year changes in freight revenues, revenue carloads, and ARC by commodity type:\n23\nMexico Business\n– Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Revenue from Mexico business was $2.4 billion in 2021, up 13% compared to 2020, driven by a 3% increase in volume and higher fuel surcharge revenue, core pricing gains, and positive mix of traffic. The volume increase was driven by the recovery from the 2020 pandemic and an increase in petroleum and grain shipments, partially offset by the impact of the global supply chain disruptions on intermodal shipments and the semiconductor shortage in the automotive industry.\nOperating Expenses\n24\nCompensation and Benefits\n– Compensation and benefits include wages, payroll taxes, health and welfare costs, pension costs, and incentive costs. In 2021, expenses increased 4% compared to 2020, due to volume related costs, inflation, 2020 management actions responding to the sharp decline in volume (temporary unpaid leave, salary reductions, and shop closures), incentive compensation, and higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events. Partially offsetting these increases were productivity initiatives resulting in employee levels that declined 3% compared to 2020 despite a 4% volume increase, a 2020 one-time bonus payment for agreement employees who worked during the pandemic, and lower severance costs.\nDepreciation\n– The majority of depreciation relates to road property, including rail, ties, ballast, and other track material. Depreciation expense was flat in 2021 compared to 2020.\nFuel\n– Fuel includes locomotive fuel and gasoline for highway and non-highway vehicles and heavy equipment. Locomotive diesel fuel prices, which averaged $2.23 per gallon (including taxes and transportation costs) in 2021, compared to $1.50 per gallon in 2020, increased expenses $668 million (excluding any impact from increased volume year-over-year). Gross ton-miles increased 6% driving higher fuel expense. Partially offsetting this increase was a 1% improvement to a record low fuel consumption rate, computed as gallons of fuel consumed divided by gross ton-miles.\nPurchased Services and Materials\n– Expense for purchased services and materials includes the costs of services purchased from outside contractors and other service providers (including equipment maintenance and contract expenses incurred by our subsidiaries for external transportation services); materials used to maintain the Railroad’s lines, structures, and equipment; costs of operating facilities jointly used by UPRR and other railroads; transportation and lodging for train crew employees; trucking and contracting costs for intermodal containers; leased automobile maintenance expenses; and tools and supplies. Purchased services and materials increased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by inflation, higher professional services expense, volume-related costs associated with our intermodal business, higher costs due to weather and wildfire-related events, increased locomotive and freight car maintenance expense as we added resources to the network, and higher costs for transportation of train crews.\nEquipment and Other Rents\n– Equipment and other rents expense primarily includes rental expense that the Railroad pays for freight cars owned by other railroads or private companies; freight car, intermodal, and locomotive leases; and office and other rent expenses, offset by equity income from certain equity method investments. Equipment and other rents expense decreased 2% compared to 2020 driven by lower rent on equipment in storage and higher equity income from our investment in TTX Company, partially offset by increased freight car rent expense due to volume increases and slower freight car velocity.\nOther\n– Other expenses include state and local taxes, freight, equipment and property damage, utilities, insurance, personal injury, environmental, employee travel, telephone and cellular, computer software, bad debt, and other general expenses. Other expenses decreased 13% in 2021 compared to 2020 as a result of a $278 million non-cash impairment charge related to our Brazos yard investment in 2020, lower write-offs of cancelled in-progress capital projects, 2020 lease impairments, and higher equity income. Partially offsetting these decreases were increased casualty expenses, including personal injury, damaged freight, and environmental, and higher state and local taxes. Both periods in 2021 and 2020 included a reduction of expense for weather and wildfire-related insurance reimbursements, $6 million and $25 million, respectively.\nNon-Operating Items\nOther Income, net\n– Other income increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a $36 million gain from the sale of an investment in a technology company, partially offset by lower real estate sale gains. Real estate sales in 2021 included a $50 million gain from a property sale to the Colorado Department of Transportation, while 2020 included a $69 million gain from a land and permanent easement sale to the Illinois State Toll Highway Authority.\nInterest Expense\n– Interest expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to an increased weighted-average debt level of $28.3 billion in 2021 from $27.9 billion in 2020. The effective interest rate was 4.1% for both periods.\nIncome Taxes\n– Income tax expense increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher pre-tax income. Our effective tax rates for 2021 and 2020 were 23.1% and 23.4%, respectively.\n25\nOTHER OPERATING/PERFORMANCE AND FINANCIAL STATISTICS\nWe report a number of key performance measures weekly to the STB. We provide this data on our website at www.up.com/investor/aar-stb_reports/index.htm.\nOperating/Performance Statistics\nManagement continuously measures these key operating metrics to evaluate our operational efficiency and asset utilization in striving to provide a consistent, reliable service product to our customers.\nRailroad performance measures are included in the table below:\nGross and Revenue Ton-Miles\n– Gross ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of loaded and empty freight cars by the number of miles hauled. Revenue ton-miles are calculated by multiplying the weight of freight by the number of tariff miles. In 2021, gross ton-miles and revenue ton-miles increased 6% and 7%, respectively, compared to 2020, driven by a 4% increase in carloadings. Changes in commodity mix drove the variance in year-over-year increases between gross ton-miles, revenue ton-miles, and carloads (smaller increases in our intermodal and automotive shipments, which are generally lighter, coupled with higher increases in grain and industrial shipments, which are generally heavier).\nFreight Car Velocity\n– Freight car velocity measures the average daily miles per car on our network. The two key drivers of this metric are the speed of the train between terminals (average train speed) and the time a rail car spends at the terminals (average terminal dwell time). Train speed slowed and terminal dwell increased in 2021 compared to the same periods in 2020 as the network handled additional volume and was impacted by weather and wildfire-related challenges, bridge outages caused by the California wildfires, other incidents causing delays on the network, and global supply chain disruptions. Continued implementation of our operating plan helped to partially offset these impacts.\nLocomotive Productivity\n– Locomotive productivity is gross ton-miles per average daily locomotive horsepower. Locomotive productivity decreased 3% in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by the increased active fleet needed to handle the 4% volume increase as well as manage network disruptions, partially offset by transportation plan changes.\nTrain Length\n– Train length is the average maximum train length on a route measured in feet. Our train length increased 6% compared to 2020 as a result of blending service products and transportation plan changes designed to improve overall operational efficiency. However, in the second half of the year, train length declined slightly from the first half of 2021 due to California wildfire bridge outage reroutes in the third quarter and operational challenges in the fourth quarter.\nCar Trip Plan Compliance\n– Car trip plan compliance is the percentage of cars delivered on time in accordance with our original trip plan. Our network trip plan compliance is broken into the intermodal and manifest/automotive products. Intermodal trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to global supply chain disruptions. Manifest/automotive trip plan compliance deteriorated in 2021 compared to 2020 as our network slowed because of the outages and incidents described above that required increased resource allocation and rebalancing.\nWorkforce Productivity\n– Workforce productivity is average daily car miles per employee. Workforce productivity improved 10%, reaching an all-time record as employee counts were down 3% compared to 2020, while average daily car miles increased 6%. Productivity initiatives and a smaller capital workforce offset higher train and engine employee levels due to weather and wildfire-related challenges, network disruptions, and reduced crew utilization keeping total employee levels lower than 2020.\nOperating Ratio\n– Operating ratio is our operating expenses reflected as a percentage of operating revenue. Our operating ratio of 57.2% was an all-time record and improved 2.7 points compared to 2020 mainly driven by a 2020 one-time impairment, core pricing gains, productivity initiatives, and positive mix of traffic, which were partially offset by higher fuel prices, inflation, and other cost increases.\n26\nReturn on Average Common Shareholders\n’\nEquity\nReturn on Invested Capital as Adjusted (ROIC)\nROIC is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the efficiency and effectiveness of our long-term capital investments. In addition, we currently use ROIC as a performance criterion in determining certain elements of equity compensation for our executives. ROIC should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, other information provided in accordance with GAAP. The most comparable GAAP measure is return on average common shareholders’ equity. The tables above provide reconciliations from return on average common shareholders’ equity to ROIC. At December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.2%, 3.7%, and 3.7%, respectively.\nAdjusted Debt / Adjusted EBITDA\nAdjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, and adjustments for other income and interest on present value of operating leases) is considered a non-GAAP financial measure by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe this measure is important to management and investors in evaluating the Company’s ability to sustain given debt levels (including leases) with the cash generated from operations. In addition, a comparable measure is used by rating agencies when reviewing the Company’s credit rating. Adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, net income. The table above provides reconciliations from net income to adjusted debt to adjusted EBITDA. At December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, the incremental borrowing rate on operating leases was 3.2%, 3.7% and 3.7%, respectively.\n27\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe are continually evaluating our financial condition and liquidity. We analyze a wide range of economic scenarios and the impact on our ability to generate cash. These analyses inform our liquidity plans and activities outlined below and indicate we have sufficient borrowing capacity to sustain an extended period of lower volumes.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a working capital deficit due to upcoming debt maturities. At December 31, 2020, we had a surplus due to an increased cash balance held due to the uncertainty related to COVID. It is not unusual for us to have a working capital deficit, and we believe it is not an indication of a lack of liquidity. We also maintain adequate resources, including our credit facility and, when necessary, access the capital markets to meet any foreseeable cash requirements.\nDuring the year, we generated $9.0 billion of cash from operating activities, completed a $1.7 billion debt exchange, and issued $3.5 billion of long-term debt. We have been, and we expect to continue to be, in compliance with our debt covenants. We increased the dividend twice during 2021 paying out $2.8 billion and repurchased shares totaling $7.3 billion, including the completion of our $2 billion accelerated share repurchase programs entered into on May 25, 2021.\nOur principal sources of liquidity include cash, cash equivalents, our Receivables Facility, our revolving credit facility, as well as the availability of commercial paper and other sources of financing through the capital markets. On December 31, 2021, we had $960 million of cash and cash equivalents, $2.0 billion of committed credit available under our revolving credit facility, and up to $500 million undrawn on the Receivables Facility. As of December 31, 2021, none of the revolving credit facility was drawn, and we did not draw on our revolving credit facility at any time during 2021. At December 31, 2021, we had $300 million of the Receivables Facility drawn, $400 million of commercial paper, and a $100 million term loan outstanding. Our access to the Receivables Facility may be reduced or restricted if our bond ratings fall to certain levels below investment grade. If our bond rating were to deteriorate, it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity. Access to commercial paper as well as other capital market financing is dependent on market conditions. Deterioration of our operating results or financial condition due to internal or external factors could negatively impact our ability to access capital markets as a source of liquidity. Access to liquidity through the capital markets is also dependent on our financial stability. We expect that we will continue to have access to liquidity through any or all the following sources or activities: (i) increasing the utilization of our Receivables Facility, (ii) issuing commercial paper, (iii) entering into bank loans, outside of our revolving credit facility, or (iv) issuing bonds or other debt securities to public or private investors based on our assessment of the current condition of the credit markets. The Company’s $2.0 billion revolving credit facility is intended to support the issuance of commercial paper by UPC and also serves as an additional source of liquidity to fund short-term needs. The Company currently does not intend to make any borrowings under this facility.\nAs described in the notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements and as referenced in the table below, we have contractual obligations that may affect our financial condition. Based on our assessment of the underlying provisions and circumstances of our contractual obligations, other than the risks that we and other similarly situated companies face with respect to the condition of the capital markets (as described in Item 1A of Part II of this report), there is no known trend, demand, commitment, event, or uncertainty that is reasonably likely to occur that would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. In addition, our commercial obligations, financings, and commitments are customary transactions that are like those of other comparable corporations, particularly within the transportation industry.\nThe following table identifies material obligations as of December 31, 2021:\nLIBOR Transition\n– See Note 14 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. The use of an alternative rate or benchmark may negatively impact the terms of our facilities, including in the form of an adverse effect on interest rates and higher borrowing costs and interest expense.\n28\nOperating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due primarily to an increase in net income, partially offset by higher receivables and the partial payment of the deferred 2020 employment tax that was allowed by a provision in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).\nCash Flow Conversion – Cash flow conversion is defined as cash provided by operating activities less cash used in capital investments as a ratio of net income.\nCash flow conversion rate is not considered a financial measure under GAAP by SEC Regulation G and Item 10 of SEC Regulation S-K and may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner. We believe cash flow conversion rate is important to management and investors in evaluating our financial performance and measures our ability to generate cash without additional external financing. Cash flow conversion rate should be considered in addition to, rather than as a substitute for, cash provided by operating activities.\nThe following table reconciles cash provided by operating activities (GAAP measure) to cash flow conversion rate (non-GAAP measure):\nInvesting Activities\nCash used in investing activities in 2021 increased compared to 2020 primarily driven by increased capital investment in road infrastructure replacements.\nThe following tables detail cash capital investments and track statistics for the years ended December 31:\n29\nCapital Plan\n– In 2022, we expect our capital plan to be approximately $3.3 billion, up 10% compared to 2021. We will continue to harden our infrastructure, replace older assets, and improve the safety and resiliency of the network. In addition, the plan\nincludes targeted freight car acquisitions, investments in growth-related projects to drive more carloads to the network, certain ramps to efficiently handle volumes from new and existing intermodal customers, continuous modernization of our locomotive fleet, and projects intended to improve operational efficiency\n. The capital plan may be revised if business conditions warrant or if new laws or regulations affect our ability to generate sufficient returns on these investments.\nFinancing Activities\nCash used in financing activities increased in 2021 compared to 2020 driven by increased share repurchases.\nSee Note 14 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, for a description of all our outstanding financing arrangements and significant new borrowings, and Note 18 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, for a description of our share repurchase programs.\nOTHER MATTERS\nInflation\n– For capital-intensive companies, inflation significantly increases asset replacement costs for long-lived assets. As a result, assuming that we replace all operating assets at current price levels, depreciation charges (on an inflation-adjusted basis) would be substantially greater than historically reported amounts.\nSensitivity Analyses\n– The sensitivity analyses that follow illustrate the economic effect that hypothetical changes in interest and tax rates could have on our results of operations and financial condition. These hypothetical changes do not consider other factors that could impact actual results.\nInterest Rates\n– At December 31, 2021, we had variable-rate debt representing approximately 2.7% of our total debt. If variable interest rates average one percentage point higher in 2022 than our December 31, 2021, variable rate, which was approximately 0.7%, our interest expense would increase by approximately $8.0 million. This amount was determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rate on the balances of our variable-rate debt at December 31, 2021.\nMarket risk for fixed-rate debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percentage point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2021, and amounts to an increase of approximately $4.9 billion to the fair value of our debt at December 31, 2021. We estimated the fair values of our fixed-rate debt by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on quoted market prices and current borrowing rates.\nTax Rates\n– Our deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured based on current tax law. Future tax legislation, such as a change in the corporate tax rate, could have a material impact on our financial condition, results of operations, or liquidity. For example, a permanent 1% increase in future income tax rates would increase our deferred tax liability by approximately $500 million. Similarly, a permanent 1% decrease in future income tax rates would decrease our deferred tax liability by approximately $500 million.\nAccounting Pronouncements\n– See Note 3 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nAsserted and Unasserted Claims\n– See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nIndemnities\n– See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nClimate Change\n– Although climate change could have an adverse impact on our operations and financial performance (see Risk Factors under Item 1A of this report), we are currently unable to predict the manner or severity of such impact. In December 2021, we released our initial Climate Action Plan, which outlines the steps we are taking to reduce our environmental impact. This plan aligns with our corporate strategy: Serve (improve operational efficiency and minimize fuel consumption), Grow (offer sustainable supply chain solutions), Win (decarbonize our footprint and the environment), Together (engage our stakeholders and align interests). We continue to take steps and explore opportunities to reduce our operational impact on the environment, including increased usage of renewable fuels, investments in new technologies, using training programs and technology to reduce fuel consumption, and changing our operations to increase fuel efficiency (see \"Sustainable Future\" in the Operations section in Item 1 of this report).\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. The preparation of these financial statements requires estimation and judgment that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets, and liabilities. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances, the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The following critical accounting estimates are a subset of our significant accounting policies described in Note 2 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8. These critical accounting estimates affect significant areas of our financial statements and involve judgment and estimates. If these estimates differ significantly from actual results, the impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements may be material.\n30\nPersonal Injury\n– See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, and \"\nWe May Be Subject to Various Claims and Lawsuits That Could Result in Significant Expenditures\"\nin the Risk Factors, Item 1A.\nOur personal injury liability is subject to uncertainty due to unasserted claims, timing and outcome of claims, and evolving trends in litigation. There were no material changes to the assumptions used in the latest actuarial analysis.\nOur personal injury liability balance and claims activity was as follows:\nEnvironmental Costs\n– See Note 17 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8, \"\nWe Are Subject to Significant Environmental Laws and Regulations\"\nin the Risk Factors, Item 1A, and Environmental Matters in the Legal Proceedings, Item 3.\nOur environmental liability is subject to several factors such as type of remediation, nature and volume of contaminate, and number and financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, as well as uncertainty due to unknown alleged contamination, evolving trends in remediation techniques and final remedies, and changes in laws and regulations.\nOur environmental liability balance and site activity was as follows:\nProperty and Depreciation\n– See Note 11 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nAssets purchased or constructed throughout the year are capitalized if they meet applicable minimum units of property.\nEstimated service lives of depreciable railroad property may vary over time due to changes in physical use, technology, asset strategies, and other factors that will have an impact on the retirement profiles of our assets. We are not aware of any specific factors that are reasonably likely to significantly change the estimated service lives of our assets. Actual use and retirement of our assets may vary from our current estimates, which would impact the amount of depreciation expense recognized in future periods.\nChanges in estimated useful lives of our assets due to the results of our depreciation studies could significantly impact future periods’ depreciation expense and have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were increased by one year, annual depreciation expense would decrease by approximately $69 million. If the estimated useful lives of all depreciable assets were decreased by one year, annual depreciation expense would increase by approximately $73 million. We are projecting an increase in our depreciation expense by approximately 2% in 2022 versus 2021. This is driven by an increase in our projected depreciable asset base\n.\nDuring the last three fiscal years, no gains or losses were recognized due to the retirement of depreciable railroad properties.\nPension Plans\n– See Note 5 to the Financial Statements and Supplementary Data, Item 8.\nThe critical assumptions used to measure pension obligations and expenses are the discount rates and expected rate of return on pension assets.\nWe evaluate our critical assumptions at least annually, and selected assumptions are based on the following factors:\n31\nThe following tables present the key assumptions used to measure net periodic pension cost/benefit for 2022 and the estimated impact on 2022 net periodic pension cost/benefit relative to a change in those assumptions:\nThe following table presents the net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31:\nCAUTIONARY INFORMATION\nCertain statements in this report, and statements in other reports or information filed or to be filed with the SEC (as well as information included in oral statements or other written statements made or to be made by us), are, or will be, forward-looking statements as defined by the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.

    "text": "33\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Union Pacific Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the \"Corporation\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in common shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Corporation's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Corporation's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nCapitalization of Properties\n—\nRefer to Notes 2 and 11 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Corporation’s operations are highly capital intensive and their large network of assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year, the Corporation develops a capital program for both the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of new assets. In determining whether costs should be capitalized, the Corporation exercises significant judgment in determining whether expenditures meet the applicable minimum units of property criteria and extend the useful life, improve the safety of operations, or improve the operating efficiency of existing assets. The Corporation capitalizes all costs of capital projects necessary to make assets ready for their intended use and because a portion of the Corporation’s assets are self-constructed, management also exercises significant judgment in determining the amount of material, labor, work equipment, and indirect costs that qualify for capitalization. Properties, net were $54,871 million as of December 31, 2021 and, during 2021, the Corporation’s capital investments were $2.9 billion.\nWe identified the capitalization of property as a critical audit matter because of the significant judgment exercised by management in determining whether costs meet the criteria for capitalization. This, in turn, required a high degree of auditor judgment when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the criteria to capitalize costs were met and to evaluate sufficiency of audit evidence to support management’s conclusions.\n34\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur procedures related to capitalization of property included the following, among others:\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nOmaha, Nebraska\nFebruary 4, 2022\nWe have served as the Corporation's auditor since 1967.\n35\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nUnion Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nUnion Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n36\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION\nUnion Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n37\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nUnion Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n38\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN COMMON SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY\nUnion Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements.\n39\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nUnion Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies\nFor purposes of this report, unless the context otherwise requires, all references herein to the “Corporation”, “Company”, “UPC”, “we”, “us”, and “our” mean Union Pacific Corporation and its subsidiaries, including Union Pacific Railroad Company, which will be separately referred to herein as “UPRR” or the “Railroad”.\n1.\nNature of Operations\nOperations and Segmentation\n– We are a Class I railroad operating in the U.S. Our network includes\n32,452\nroute miles, connecting Pacific Coast and Gulf Coast ports with the Midwest and Eastern U.S. gateways and providing several corridors to key Mexican and Canadian gateways. We own\n26,124\nmiles and operate on the remainder pursuant to trackage rights or leases. We serve the western\ntwo\n-thirds of the country and maintain coordinated schedules with other rail carriers for the handling of freight to and from the Atlantic Coast, the Pacific Coast, the Southeast, the Southwest, Canada, and Mexico. Export and import traffic is moved through Gulf Coast and Pacific Coast ports and across the Mexican and Canadian borders.\nThe Railroad, along with its subsidiaries and rail affiliates, is our\none\nreportable operating segment. Although we provide and analyze revenue by commodity group, we treat the financial results of the Railroad as\none\nsegment due to the integrated nature of our rail network. Our operating revenues are primarily derived from contracts with customers for the transportation of freight from origin to destination. The following table represents a disaggregation of our freight and other revenues:\nAlthough our revenues are principally derived from customers domiciled in the U.S., the ultimate points of origination or destination for some products we transport are outside the U.S. Each of our commodity groups includes revenue from shipments to and from Mexico. Included in the above table are freight revenues from our Mexico business which amounted to $\n2.4\nbillion in\n2021\n, $\n2.1\nbillion in\n2020\n, and $\n2.3\nbillion in\n2019\n.\nBasis of Presentation\n– The Consolidated Financial Statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. (GAAP) as codified in the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) Accounting Standards Codification (ASC).\n2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n– The Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Union Pacific Corporation and all of its subsidiaries. Investments in affiliated companies (\n20%\nto\n50%\nowned) are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. All intercompany transactions are eliminated. We currently have\nno\nless than majority-owned investments that require consolidation under variable interest entity requirements.\nCash, Cash Equivalents, and Restricted Cash\n– Cash equivalents consist of investments with original maturities of\nthree\nmonths or less. Amounts included in restricted cash represent those required to be set aside by contractual agreement.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash reported within the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position that sum to the total of the same such amounts shown on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nAccounts Receivable\n– Accounts receivable includes receivables reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. The allowance is based upon historical losses, credit worthiness of customers, and current economic conditions. Receivables\nnot\nexpected to be collected in\none\nyear and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nInvestments\n– Investments represent our investments in affiliated companies (\n20%\nto\n50%\nowned) that are accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and investments in companies (less than\n20%\nowned) accounted for at fair value when there is a readily determined fair value or at cost minus impairment when there are\nnot\nreadily determinable fair values. Our portion of income/loss on equity method investments that are integral to our operations are recorded in operating expenses. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on investments that are\nnot\nintegral to our operations are recorded in other income.\nMaterials and Supplies\n– Materials and supplies are carried at the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\n40\nProperty and Depreciation\n– Properties and equipment are carried at cost and are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated service lives, which are measured in years, except for rail in high-density traffic corridors (i.e., all rail lines except for those subject to abandonment, and yard and switching tracks), where lives are measured in millions of gross tons per mile of track. We use the group method of depreciation where all items with similar characteristics, use, and expected lives are grouped together in asset classes and are depreciated using composite depreciation rates. The group method of depreciation treats each asset class as a pool of resources,\nnot\nas singular items. We determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies. Under the group method of depreciation,\nno\ngain or loss is recognized when depreciable property is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets\n– We review long-lived assets, including identifiable intangibles, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of the long-lived assets, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.\nRevenue Recognition\n– Freight revenues are derived from contracts with customers. We account for a contract when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance, and collectability of consideration is probable. Our contracts include private agreements, private rate/letter quotes, public circulars/tariffs, and interline/foreign agreements. The performance obligation in our contracts is typically delivering a specific commodity from a place of origin to a place of destination and our commitment begins with the tendering and acceptance of a freight bill of lading and is satisfied upon delivery at destination. We consider each freight shipment to be a distinct performance obligation.\nWe recognize freight revenues over time as freight moves from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Outstanding performance obligations related to freight moves in transit totaled $\n169\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\n, and $\n151\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2020\n, and are expected to be recognized in the following quarter as we satisfy our remaining performance obligations and deliver freight to destination. The transaction price is generally specified in a contract and\nmay\nbe dependent on the commodity, origin/destination, and route. Customer incentives, which are primarily provided for shipping to/from specific locations or based on cumulative volumes, are recorded as a reduction to operating revenues. Customer incentives that include variable consideration based on cumulative volumes are estimated using the expected value method, which is based on available historical, current, and forecasted volumes, and recognized as the related performance obligation is satisfied.\nUnder typical payment terms, our customers pay us after each performance obligation is satisfied and there are\nno\nmaterial contract assets or liabilities associated with our freight revenues. Outstanding freight receivables are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position as accounts receivable, net.\nFreight revenues related to interline transportation services that involve other railroads are reported on a net basis. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted by the Company to another party is\nnot\nreflected as freight revenues.\nOther revenues consist primarily of revenues earned by our other subsidiaries (primarily logistics and commuter rail operations) and accessorial revenues. Other subsidiary revenues are generally recognized over time as shipments move from origin to destination. The allocation of revenue between reporting periods is based on the relative transit time in each reporting period with expenses recognized as incurred. Accessorial revenues are recognized at a point in time as performance obligations are satisfied.\nTranslation of Foreign Currency\n– Our portion of the assets and liabilities related to foreign investments are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at the average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Unrealized gains or losses are reflected within common shareholders’ equity as accumulated other comprehensive income or loss.\nFair Value Measurements\n– We use a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into\nthree\nbroad levels. The level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels include:\nLevel\n1:\nQuoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel\n2:\nObservable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel\n3:\nUnobservable inputs that are\nnot\ncorroborated by market data.\nWe have applied fair value measurements to our short-term investments, certain equity investments, pension plan assets, and short- and long-term debt.\nStock-Based Compensation\n– We issue treasury shares to cover stock option exercises, stock unit vestings, and ESPP shares, while new shares are issued when retention shares are granted.\nWe measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock-based awards made to employees, including stock options and ESPP awards. Compensation expense is based on the fair value of the awards as measured at the grant date and is expensed ratably over the service period of the awards (generally the vesting period). The fair value of retention awards is the closing stock price on the date of grant, the fair value of stock options is determined by using the Black-Scholes option pricing model, and the fair value of ESPP awards is based on the Company contribution match.\nEarnings Per Share\n– Basic earnings per share are calculated on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each period. Diluted earnings per share include shares issuable upon exercise of outstanding stock options and stock-based awards where the conversion of such instruments would be dilutive.\n41\nIncome Taxes\n– We account for income taxes by recording taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that are reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax purposes. The majority of our deferred tax assets relate to expenses that already have been recorded for financial reporting purposes but\nnot\ndeducted for tax purposes. The majority of our deferred tax liabilities relate to differences between the tax bases and financial reporting amounts of our land and depreciable property, due to accelerated tax depreciation (including bonus depreciation), revaluation of assets in purchase accounting transactions, and differences in capitalization methods. These expected future tax consequences are measured based on current tax law; the effects of future tax legislation are\nnot\nanticipated.\nWhen appropriate, we record a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to reflect that these tax assets\nmay\nnot\nbe realized. In determining whether a valuation allowance is appropriate, we consider whether it is more likely than\nnot\nthat all or some portion of our deferred tax assets will\nnot\nbe realized, based on management’s judgments using available evidence for purposes of estimating whether future taxable income will be sufficient to realize a deferred tax asset.\nWe recognize tax benefits that are more likely than\nnot\nto be sustained upon examination by tax authorities. The amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than\n50\npercent likely to be realized upon settlement. A liability for “unrecognized tax benefits” is recorded for any tax benefits claimed in our tax returns that do\nnot\nmeet these recognition and measurement standards.\nLeases\n– We determine if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception. Operating lease assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. When an implicit rate is\nnot\navailable, we use a collateralized incremental borrowing rate for operating leases based on the information available at commencement date, including lease term, in determining the present value of future payments. The operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives and initial direct costs incurred. Our lease terms\nmay\ninclude options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Operating leases are included in operating lease assets, accounts payable and other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Finance leases are included in properties, net, debt due within\none\nyear, and debt due after\none\nyear on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and primarily reported in equipment and other rents and financing lease expense is recorded as depreciation and interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and we have elected to\nnot\nseparate lease and non-lease components for all classes of underlying assets. Leases with an initial term of\n12\nmonths or less are\nnot\nrecorded on our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Leases with initial terms in excess of\n12\nmonths are recorded as operating or financing leases in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nPension Benefits\n– In order to measure the expense associated with pension benefits, we must make various assumptions including discount rates used to value certain liabilities, expected return on plan assets used to fund these expenses, compensation increases, employee turnover rates, and anticipated mortality rates. The assumptions used by us are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and circumstances. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability associated with these benefits.\nPersonal Injury\n– The cost of injuries to employees and others on our property is charged to expense based on estimates of the ultimate cost and number of incidents each year. We use an actuarial analysis to measure the expense and liability, including unasserted claims. Our personal injury liability is\nnot\ndiscounted to present value due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of future payments. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.\nEnvironmental\n– When environmental issues have been identified with respect to property currently or formerly owned, leased, or otherwise used in the conduct of our business, we perform, with the assistance of our consultants, environmental assessments on such property. We expense the cost of the assessments as incurred. We accrue the cost of remediation where our obligation is probable and such costs can be reasonably estimated. We do\nnot\ndiscount our environmental liabilities when the timing of the anticipated cash payments is\nnot\nfixed or readily determinable. Legal fees and incidental costs are expensed as incurred.\nUse of Estimates\n– The preparation of our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect certain reported assets and liabilities, the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the Consolidated Financial Statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual future results\nmay\ndiffer from such estimates.\n3.\nAccounting Pronouncements\nIn\nDecember 2019,\nthe FASB issued Accounting Standards Update\nNo.\n2019\n-\n12\n(ASU\n2019\n-\n12\n),\nIncome Taxes (Topic\n740\n): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n, which simplifies the accounting and disclosure requirements for income taxes by clarifying existing guidance to improve consistency in application of Accounting Standards Codification (ASC)\n740.\nThe Company adopted the ASU on\nJanuary 1, 2021 (\nthe effective date), and it did\nnot\nhave a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related disclosures.\nIn\nMarch 2020,\nthe FASB issued Accounting Standards Update\nNo.\n2020\n-\n04\n(ASU\n2020\n-\n04\n),\nReference Rate Reform (Topic\n848\n): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\n, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP principles to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions that reference London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued due to reference rate reform.

Under the Directors Plan, each non-employee director, upon his or her initial election to the Board of Directors, received a grant of\n4,000\nretention shares or retention stock units. In\nJuly 2018,\nthe Board of Directors eliminated the retention grant for directors newly elected in\n2018\nand all future years. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n,\n28,000\nrestricted shares were outstanding under the Directors Plan.\nThe Union Pacific Corporation\n2004\nStock Incentive Plan (\n2004\nPlan) was approved by shareholders in\nApril 2004.\nThe\n2004\nPlan reserved\n84,000,000\nshares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans that were outstanding on\nApril 16, 2004,\nand became available for regrant pursuant to the terms of the\n2004\nPlan. Under the\n2004\nPlan, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards\nmay\nbe granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are\nnot\neligible for awards under the\n2004\nPlan. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n,\n37,778\nstock options were outstanding under the\n2004\nPlan. We\nno\nlonger grant any stock options or other stock or unit awards under this plan.\nThe Union Pacific Corporation\n2013\nStock Incentive Plan (\n2013\nPlan) was approved by shareholders in\nMay 2013.\nThe\n2013\nPlan reserved\n78,000,000\nshares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans as of\nFebruary 28, 2013,\nthat are subsequently cancelled, expired, forfeited, or otherwise\nnot\nissued under previous plans. Under the\n2013\nPlan, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards\nmay\nbe granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are\nnot\neligible for awards under the\n2013\nPlan. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n,\n1,706,288\nstock options and\n1,218,397\nretention shares and stock units were outstanding under the\n2013\nPlan. We\nno\nlonger grant any stock options or other stock or unit awards under this plan.\nThe Union Pacific Corporation\n2021\nStock Incentive Plan (\n2021\nPlan) was approved by shareholders in\nMay 2021.\nThe\n2021\nPlan reserved\n23,000,000\nshares of our common stock for issuance, plus any shares subject to awards made under previous plans as of\nDecember 31, 2020,\nthat are subsequently cancelled, expired, forfeited, or otherwise\nnot\nissued under previous plans. Under the\n2021\nPlan, non-qualified stock options, incentive stock options, retention shares, stock units, and incentive bonus awards\nmay\nbe granted to eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries. Non-employee directors are\nnot\neligible for awards under the\n2021\nPlan. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n,\n361,935\nstock options and\n389,207\nretention shares were outstanding under the\n2021\nPlan.\nThe Union Pacific Corporation\n2021\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan (\n2021\nESPP) was approved by shareholders in\nMay 2021.\nThe\n2021\nESPP reserved\n10,000,000\nshares of our common stock for issuance. Under the\n2021\nESPP, eligible employees of the Corporation and its subsidiaries\nmay\nelect to purchase shares with a Company match award. Non-employee directors are\nnot\neligible for awards under the\n2021\nESPP. As of\nDecember 31, 2021,\n97,641\nshares were issued under the\n2021\nESPP.\nPursuant to the above plans\n34,011,624;\n69,867,405;\nand\n70,318,887;\nshares of our common stock were authorized and available for grant at\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019\n, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\n– We have several stock-based compensation plans under which employees receive nonvested stock options, nonvested retention shares, and nonvested stock units. We refer to the nonvested shares and stock units collectively as “retention awards”. Employees are also able to participate in our ESPP.\nInformation regarding stock-based compensation appears in the table below:\n43\nStock Options\n– Stock options are granted at the closing price on the date of grant, have\n10\n-year contractual terms, and vest\nno\nlater than\n3\nyears from the date of grant.\nNone\nof the stock options outstanding at\nDecember 31, 2021,\nare subject to performance or market-based vesting conditions.\nThe table below shows the annual weighted-average assumptions used for Black-Scholes valuation purposes:\nThe risk-free rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; the expected dividend yield is calculated as the ratio of dividends paid per share of common stock to the stock price on the date of grant; the expected life is based on historical and expected exercise behavior; and expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of our stock price over the expected life of the stock option.\nA summary of stock option activity during\n2021\nis presented below:\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021\n, there was $\n15\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.0\nyear. Additional information regarding stock option exercises appears in the following table:\nRetention Awards\n– Retention awards are granted at\nno\ncost to the employee, vest over periods lasting up to\n4\nyears, and dividends and dividend equivalents are paid to participants during the vesting periods.\nChanges in our retention awards during\n2021\nwere as follows:\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021\n, there was $\n87\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.4\nyears.\n44\nPerformance Retention Awards\n– In\nFebruary 2021,\nour Board of Directors approved performance stock unit grants. This plan is based on performance targets for annual return on invested capital (ROIC) and operating income growth (OIG) compared to companies in the S&P\n100\nIndustrials Index plus the Class I railroads. We define ROIC as net operating profit adjusted for interest expense (including interest on average operating lease liabilities) and taxes on interest divided by average invested capital adjusted for average operating lease liabilities.\nThe\nFebruary 2021\nstock units awarded to selected employees are subject to continued employment for\n37\nmonths, the attainment of certain levels of ROIC, and the relative\nthree\n-year OIG. We expense\ntwo\n-thirds of the fair value of the units that are probable of being earned based on our forecasted ROIC over the\n3\n-year performance period, and with respect to the\nthird\nyear of the plan, the remaining\none\n-\nthird\nof the fair value is subject to the relative\nthree\n-year OIG. We measure the fair value of performance stock units based upon the closing price of the underlying common stock as of the date of grant. Dividend equivalents are accumulated during the service period and paid to participants only after the units are earned.\nThe\nFebruary 2020\nand\n2019\nperformance stock unit grants expense recognition and basic terms were similar to the\nFebruary 2021\ngrant except the relative OIG targets were a modifier as compared to companies included in the S&P\n500\nIndustrials Index. The modifier can be up to +/-\n25\n% of the award earned based on the ROIC achieved.\nChanges in our performance retention awards during\n2021\nwere as follows:\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021\n, there was $\n16\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested performance retention awards, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.2\nyears. This expense is subject to achievement of the performance measures established for the performance stock unit grants.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\n- Our ESPP started in\nJuly 2021.\nEmployee and Company contributions are used to issue treasury shares the month after employee contributions are withheld based on the settlement date closing price. The Company matches\n40\n% contributed by the employee up to a maximum employee contribution of\n5\n% of monthly salary (limited to $\n15,000\nannually). We expense the Company contributions in the month the employee services were rendered (i.e., the month the employee contributions were withheld).\n5.\nRetirement Plans\nPension Benefits\nWe provide defined benefit retirement income to eligible non-union employees through qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans. Qualified and non-qualified pension benefits are based on years of service and the highest compensation during the latest years of employment, with specific reductions made for early retirements. Non-union employees hired on or after\nJanuary 1, 2018,\nare\nno\nlonger eligible for pension benefits, but are eligible for an enhanced\n401\n(k) benefit as described below in other retirement programs.\nFunded Status\nWe are required by GAAP to separately recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our pension plans as an asset or liability. The funded status represents the difference between the projected benefit obligation (PBO) and the fair value of the plan assets. Our non-qualified (supplemental) pension plan is unfunded by design. The PBO of the pension plans is the present value of benefits earned to date by plan participants, including the effect of assumed future compensation increases. Plan assets are measured at fair value. We use a\nDecember 31\nmeasurement date for plan assets and obligations for all our retirement plans.\n45\nChanges in our PBO and plan assets were as follows for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n:\nActuarial gains that decreased the PBO were driven by an increase in\n2021\ndiscount rates from\n2.42\n% to\n2.80\n%.\nAmounts recognized in the statement of financial position as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, consist of:\nPre-tax amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss consist of $\n851\nmillion and $\n1,805\nmillion net actuarial loss as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively.\nPre-tax changes recognized in other comprehensive income/loss as of\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nwere as follows:\nUnderfunded Accumulated Benefit Obligation\n– The accumulated benefit obligation (ABO) is the present value of benefits earned to date, assuming\nno\nfuture compensation growth. The underfunded accumulated benefit obligation represents the difference between the ABO and the fair value of plan assets.\nThe following table discloses only the PBO, ABO, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans where the accumulated benefit obligation is in excess of the fair value of the plan assets as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020:\nThe ABO for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n4.9\nbillion and $\n5.2\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively.\nAssumptions\n– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n:\n46\nExpense\nPension expense is determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits (the actuarial cost of benefits earned during a period) and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets that recognizes changes in fair value over a\n5\n-year period. This practice is intended to reduce year-to-year volatility in pension expense, but it can have the effect of delaying the recognition of differences between actual returns on assets and expected returns based on long-term rate of return assumptions. Differences in actual experience in relation to assumptions are\nnot\nrecognized in net income immediately, but are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income/loss and, if necessary, amortized as pension expense.\nThe components of our net periodic pension cost were as follows for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019:\nAssumptions\n– The weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine expense were as follows:\nWe measure the service cost and interest cost components of our net periodic pension cost by using individual spot discount rates matched with separate cash flows for each future year. The discount rates were based on a yield curve of high-quality corporate bonds. The expected return on plan assets is based on our asset allocation mix and our historical return, taking into account current and expected market conditions. The actual return/loss on pension plan assets, net of fees, was approximately\n15\n%\nin\n2021\n,\n16\n% in\n2020\n, and\n20\n% in\n2019\n.\nCash Contributions\nThe following table details cash contributions, if any, for the qualified and non-qualified (supplemental) pension plans:\nOur policy with respect to funding the qualified plans is to fund at least the minimum required by law and\nnot\nmore than the maximum amount deductible for tax purposes.\nThe non-qualified pension plans are\nnot\nfunded and are\nnot\nsubject to any minimum regulatory funding requirements. Benefit payments for each year represent supplemental pension payments. We anticipate our\n2022\nsupplemental pension payments will be made from cash generated from operations.\n47\nBenefit Payments\nThe following table details expected benefit payments for the years\n2022\nthrough\n2031:\nAsset Allocation Strategy\nOur pension plan asset allocation at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, and target allocation for\n2022,\nare as follows:\nThe pension plan investments are held in a master trust. The investment strategy for pension plan assets is to maintain a broadly diversified portfolio designed to achieve our target average long-term rate of return of\n6.25\n%. While we believe we can achieve a long-term average rate of return of\n6.25\n%, we cannot be certain that the portfolio will perform to our expectations. Assets are strategically allocated among equity, debt, and other investments in order to achieve a diversification level that reduces fluctuations in investment returns. Asset allocation target ranges for equity, debt, and other portfolios are evaluated at least every\nthree\nyears with the assistance of an independent consulting firm. Actual asset allocations are monitored monthly, and rebalancing actions are executed at least quarterly, as needed.\nSince\n2020,\nthe asset allocation targets for equity and debt have been adjusted annually to move from equity to debt as a de-risking measure. The current target endpoint for this de-risking is\n45\n% equity and\n55\n% debt in\n2023.\nEquity risks are balanced by investing a significant portion of the plans’ assets in high-quality debt securities. The average credit rating of the debt portfolio was\nA+\nand A\nat\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively. The debt portfolio is also broadly diversified and invested primarily in U.S. Treasury, mortgage, and corporate securities. The weighted-average maturity of the debt portfolio was\n20\nyears and\n17\nyears at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively.\nThe investment of pension plan assets in securities issued by UPC is explicitly prohibited by the plan for both the equity and debt portfolios, other than through index fund holdings.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe pension plan assets are valued at fair value. The following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the investments measured at fair value, including the general classification of such instruments pursuant to the valuation hierarchy.\nTemporary Cash Investments\n– These investments consist of U.S. dollars, foreign currencies, and commercial paper held in master trust accounts at The Northern Trust Company (the Trustee). Foreign currencies held are reported in terms of U.S. dollars based on currency exchange rates readily available in active markets. U.S. dollars and foreign currencies are classified as Level\n1\ninvestments. Commercial paper assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Commercial paper is classified as Level\n2\ninvestments.\nRegistered Investment Companies\n– Registered Investment Companies are entities primarily engaged in the business of investing in securities and are registered with the SEC. The plan’s holdings of Registered Investment Companies include both public and private fund vehicles. The public vehicles are exchange-traded funds (stocks), which are classified as Level\n1\ninvestments. The private vehicles (bonds) do\nnot\nhave published pricing and are valued using Net Asset Value (NAV).\nFederal Government Securities\n– Federal Government Securities consist of bills, notes, bonds, and other fixed income securities issued directly by the U.S. Treasury or by government-sponsored enterprises. These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Federal Government Securities are classified as Level\n2\ninvestments.\nBonds and Debentures\n– Bonds and debentures consist of debt securities issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations as well as state and local governments. These assets are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Corporate, state, and municipal bonds and debentures are classified as Level\n2\ninvestments.\nCorporate Stock\n– This investment category consists of common and preferred stock issued by U.S. and non-U.S. corporations. Most common shares are traded actively on exchanges and price quotes for these shares are readily available. Common stock is classified as a Level\n1\ninvestment. Preferred shares included in this category are valued using a bid evaluation process with bid data provided by independent pricing sources. Preferred stock is classified as a Level\n2\ninvestment.\n48\nVenture Capital and Buyout Partnerships\n– This investment category is comprised of interests in limited partnerships that invest primarily in privately-held companies. Due to the private nature of the partnership investments, pricing inputs are\nnot\nreadily observable. Asset valuations are developed by the general partners that manage the partnerships. These valuations are based on the application of public market multiples to private company cash flows, market transactions that provide valuation information for comparable companies, and other methods. The fair value recorded by the plan is calculated using each partnership’s NAV.\nReal Estate Funds\n– Most of the plan’s real estate investments are primarily interests in private real estate investment trusts, partnerships, limited liability companies, and similar structures. Valuations for the holdings in this category are\nnot\nbased on readily observable inputs and are primarily derived from property appraisals. The fair value recorded by the plan is calculated using the NAV for each investment.\nCollective Trust and Other Funds\n– Collective trust and other funds are comprised of shares or units in commingled funds and limited liability companies that are\nnot\npublicly traded. The underlying assets in these entities (U.S. stock funds, non-U.S. stock funds, commodity funds, hedge funds, and short-term investment funds) are publicly traded on exchanges and price quotes for the assets held by these funds are readily available. The fair value recorded by the plan is calculated using NAV for each investment.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021\n, the pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows:\n49\nThe master trust’s investments in limited partnerships and similar structures (used to invest in private equity and real estate) are valued at fair value based on their proportionate share of the partnerships’ fair value as recorded in the limited partnerships’ audited financial statements. The limited partnerships allocate gains, losses, and expenses to the partners based on the ownership percentage as described in the partnership agreements. At\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, the master trust had future commitments for additional contributions to private equity partnerships totaling $\n115\nmillion and $\n147\nmillion, respectively, and to real estate partnerships and funds totaling $\n7\nmillion and $\n7\nmillion, respectively.\nOther Retirement Programs\nOther Postretirement Benefits (OPEB)\n– We provide medical and life insurance benefits for eligible retirees hired before\nJanuary 1, 2004.\nThese benefits are funded as medical claims and life insurance premiums are paid. OPEB expense is determined based upon the annual service cost of benefits and the interest cost on those liabilities, less the expected return on plan assets. Our OPEB liability was $\n165\nmillion and $\n190\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively. OPEB net periodic benefit cost/(benefit) was ($\n3\n) million in\n2021\n, ($\n1\n) million in\n2020\n, and $\n10\nmillion in\n2019\n.\n401\n(k)/Thrift Plan\n– For non-union employees hired prior to\nJanuary 1, 2018,\nand eligible union employees for whom we make matching contributions, we provide a defined contribution plan (\n401\n(k)/thrift plan). We match\n50\n% for each dollar contributed by employees up to the\nfirst\n6\n% of compensation contributed. For non-union employees hired on or after\nJanuary 1, 2018,\nwe match\n100\n% for each dollar, up to the\nfirst\n6\n% of compensation contributed, in addition to contributing an annual amount of\n3\n% of the employee’s annual base salary. Our plan contributions were $\n21\nmillion in\n2021\n, $\n19\nmillion in\n2020\n, and $\n20\nmillion in\n2019\n.\nRailroad Retirement System\n– All Railroad employees are covered by the Railroad Retirement System (the System). Contributions made to the System are expensed as incurred and amounted to approximately $\n550\nmillion in\n2021\n, $\n569\nmillion in\n2020\n, and $\n654\nmillion in\n2019\n.\nCollective Bargaining Agreements\n– Under collective bargaining agreements, we participate in multi-employer benefit plans that provide certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for eligible union employees. Premiums paid under these plans are expensed as incurred and amounted to $\n30\nmillion in\n2021\n, $\n30\nmillion in\n2020\n, and $\n42\nmillion in\n2019\n.\n6.\nOther Income\nOther income included the following for the years ended\nDecember 31:\n7.\nIncome Taxes\nComponents of income tax expense were as follows for the years ended\nDecember 31:\n50\nFor the years ended\nDecember 31,\nreconciliations between statutory and effective tax rates are as follows:\nDeferred income tax assets/(liabilities) were comprised of the following at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020:\nIn\n2021\nand\n2020\n, there were\nno\nvaluation allowances against deferred tax assets.\nA reconciliation of changes in unrecognized tax benefits liabilities/(assets) from the beginning to the end of the reporting period is as follows:\nWe recognize interest and penalties as part of income tax expense. Total accrued liabilities/(receivables) for interest and penalties were ($\n1\n) million and $\n8\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively. Total interest and penalties recognized as part of income tax expense/(benefit) were ($\n5\n) million for\n2021\n, $\n5\nmillion for\n2020\n, and ($\n4\n) million for\n2019\n.\nSeveral state tax authorities are examining our state income tax returns for years\n2017\nthrough\n2019.\nWe do\nnot\nexpect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly in the next\n12\nmonths. The portion of our unrecognized tax benefits that relates to permanent changes in tax and interest would reduce our effective tax rate, if recognized. The remaining unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax positions for which only the timing of the benefit is uncertain. The unrecognized tax benefits that would reduce our effective tax rate are $\n31\nmillion for\n2021,\n$\n52\nmillion for\n2020,\nand $\n39\nmillion for\n2019.\n51\n8.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table provides a reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020\nand\n2019:\nCommon stock options totaling\n0.2\nmillion,\n0.3\nmillion, and\n0.5\nmillion for\n2021\n,\n2020\n, and\n2019\n, respectively, were excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share because the exercise prices of these stock options exceeded the average market price of our common stock for the respective periods, and the effect of their inclusion would be anti-dilutive.\n9.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income/Loss\nReclassifications out of accumulated other comprehensive income/loss were as follows (net of tax):\n10.\nAccounts Receivable\nAccounts receivable includes freight and other receivables reduced by an allowance for doubtful accounts. At\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, our accounts receivable were reduced by $\n10\nmillion and $\n17\nmillion, respectively. Receivables\nnot\nexpected to be collected in\none\nyear and the associated allowances are classified as other assets in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Receivables classified as other assets were reduced by allowances of $\n51\nmillion at both\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n.\nReceivables Securitization Facility\n– The Railroad maintains an $\n800\nmillion,\n3\n-year receivables securitization facility (the Receivables Facility) maturing in\nJuly 2022.\nUnder the Receivables Facility, the Railroad sells most of its eligible\nthird\n-party receivables to Union Pacific Receivables, Inc. (UPRI), a consolidated, wholly-owned, bankruptcy-remote subsidiary that\nmay\nsubsequently transfer, without recourse, an undivided interest in accounts receivable to investors. The investors have\nno\nrecourse to the Railroad’s other assets except for customary warranty and indemnity claims. Creditors of the Railroad do\nnot\nhave recourse to the assets of UPRI.\nThe amount recorded under the Receivables Facility was $\n300\nmillion and $\n0\nat\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively. The Receivables Facility was supported by $\n1.3\nbillion and $\n1.2\nbillion of accounts receivable as collateral at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively, which, as a retained interest, is included in accounts receivable, net in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nThe outstanding amount the Railroad maintains under the Receivables Facility\nmay\nfluctuate based on current cash needs. The maximum allowed under the facility is $\n800\nmillion with availability directly impacted by eligible receivables, business volumes, and credit risks, including receivables payment quality measures such as default and dilution ratios. If default or dilution ratios increase\none\npercent, the allowable outstanding amount under the Receivables Facility would\nnot\nmaterially change.\nThe costs of the Receivables Facility include interest, which will vary based on prevailing benchmark and commercial paper rates, program fees paid to participating banks, commercial paper issuance costs, and fees of participating banks for unused commitment availability. The costs of the Receivables Facility are included in interest expense and were $\n4\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion, and $\n14\nmillion for\n2021\n,\n2020\n, and\n2019\n, respectively.\n52\n11.\nProperties\nThe following tables list the major categories of property and equipment as well as the weighted-average estimated useful life for each category (in years):\nProperty and Depreciation\n– Our railroad operations are highly capital-intensive, and our large base of homogeneous, network-type assets turns over on a continuous basis. Each year we develop a capital program for the replacement of assets and for the acquisition or construction of assets that enable us to enhance our operations or provide new service offerings to customers. We currently have more than\n60\ndepreciable asset classes, and we\nmay\nincrease or decrease the number of asset classes due to changes in technology, asset strategies, or other factors.\nWe determine the estimated service lives of depreciable railroad assets by means of depreciation studies. We perform depreciation studies at least every\n3\nyears for equipment and every\n6\nyears for track assets (i.e., rail and other track material, ties, and ballast) and other road property. Our depreciation studies take into account the following factors:\n53\nFor rail in high-density traffic corridors, we measure estimated service lives in millions of gross tons per mile of track. It has been our experience that the lives of rail in high-density traffic corridors are closely correlated to usage (i.e., the amount of weight carried over the rail). The service lives also vary based on rail weight, rail condition (e.g., new or secondhand), and rail type (e.g., straight or curve). Our depreciation studies for rail in high-density traffic corridors consider each of these factors in determining the estimated service lives. For rail in high-density traffic corridors, we calculate depreciation rates annually by dividing the number of gross ton-miles carried over the rail (i.e., the weight of loaded and empty freight cars, locomotives, and maintenance of way equipment transported over the rail) by the estimated service lives of the rail measured in millions of gross tons per mile. For all other depreciable assets, we compute depreciation based on the estimated service lives of our assets as determined from the analysis of our depreciation studies. Changes in the estimated service lives of our assets and their related depreciation rates are implemented prospectively.\nUnder the group method of depreciation, the historical cost (net of salvage) of depreciable property that is retired or replaced in the ordinary course of business is charged to accumulated depreciation and\nno\ngain or loss is recognized. The historical cost of certain track assets is estimated by multiplying the current replacement cost of track assets by a historical index factor derived from (i) inflation indices published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and (ii) the estimated useful lives of the assets as determined by our depreciation studies. The indices were selected because they closely correlate with the major costs of the properties comprising the applicable track asset classes. Because of the number of estimates inherent in the depreciation and retirement processes and because it is impossible to precisely estimate each of these variables until a group of property is completely retired, we continually monitor the estimated service lives of our assets and the accumulated depreciation associated with each asset class to ensure our depreciation rates are appropriate. In addition, we determine if the recorded amount of accumulated depreciation is deficient (or in excess) of the amount indicated by our depreciation studies. Any deficiency (or excess) is amortized as a component of depreciation expense over the remaining service lives of the applicable classes of assets.\nFor retirements of depreciable railroad properties that do\nnot\noccur in the normal course of business, a gain or loss\nmay\nbe recognized if the retirement meets each of the following\nthree\nconditions: (i) is unusual, (ii) is material in amount, and (iii) varies significantly from the retirement profile identified through our depreciation studies. A gain or loss is recognized in other income when we sell land or dispose of assets that are\nnot\npart of our railroad operations.\nWe review construction in progress assets that have\nnot\nyet been placed into service, for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a long-lived asset or assets\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. If impairment indicators are present and the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying value of construction in progress assets when grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level where identifiable cash flows are largely independent, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair value.\nWhen we purchase an asset, we capitalize all costs necessary to make the asset ready for its intended use. However, many of our assets are self-constructed. A large portion of our capital expenditures is for replacement of existing track assets and other road properties, which is typically performed by our employees, and for track line expansion and other capacity projects. Costs that are directly attributable to capital projects (including overhead costs) are capitalized. Direct costs that are capitalized as part of self-constructed assets include material, labor, and work equipment. Indirect costs are capitalized if they clearly relate to the construction of the asset.\nCosts incurred that extend the useful life of an asset, improve the safety of our operations, or improve operating efficiency are capitalized, while normal repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. These costs are allocated using appropriate statistical bases. Total expense for repairs and maintenance incurred was $\n2.1\nbillion for\n2021\n, $\n2.0\nbillion for\n2020\n, and $\n2.3\nbillion for\n2019\n.\nAssets held under finance leases are recorded at the lower of the net present value of the minimum lease payments or the fair value of the leased asset at the inception of the lease. Amortization expense is computed using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the period of the related lease.\nBrazos Yard Impairment\n– In the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2020,\nwe made the strategic decision that our Brazos yard investments made to date will be used for freight car block swapping activities, rather than proceeding with additional investments required to complete the freight car classification yard. As a result, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n278\nmillion, recognized in other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income. The Brazos yard investment was recorded as construction in progress as it had\nnot\nyet been placed into service. We estimated the fair value of the remaining Brazos investments\nnot\nused for freight car block swapping activities based on market values of similar assets, which are Level\n2\ninputs.\n12.\nAccounts Payable and Other Current Liabilities\n54\n13.\nFinancial Instruments\nShort-Term Investments\n– All of the Company’s short-term investments consist of time deposits and government agency securities. These investments are considered Level\n2\ninvestments and are valued at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n, the Company had $\n46\nmillion of short-term investments. All short-term investments have a maturity of less than\none\nyear and are classified as held-to-maturity.\nFair Value of Financial Instruments\n– The fair value of our short- and long-term debt was estimated using a market value price model, which utilizes applicable U.S. Treasury rates along with current market quotes on comparable debt securities. All of the inputs used to determine the fair market value of the Corporation’s long-term debt are Level\n2\ninputs and obtained from an independent source. At\nDecember 31, 2021\n, the fair value of total debt was $\n32.9\nbillion, approximately $\n3.2\nbillion more than the carrying value. At\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the fair value of total debt was $\n31.9\nbillion, approximately $\n5.1\nbillion more than the carrying value. The fair value of the Corporation’s debt is a measure of its current value under present market conditions. The fair value of our cash equivalents approximates their carrying value due to the short-term maturities of these instruments.\n14.\nDebt\nTotal debt as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\nis summarized below:\nDebt Maturities\n– The following table presents aggregate debt maturities as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n, excluding market value adjustments:\nEquipment Encumbrances\n– Equipment with a carrying value of approximately $\n1.2\nbillion and $\n1.3\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, respectively, served as collateral for finance leases and other types of equipment obligations in accordance with the secured financing arrangements utilized to acquire or refinance such railroad equipment.\nDebt Redemptions\n–\nOn\nNovember 1, 2020\n,\nwe redeemed all $\n500\nmillion of outstanding\n4.0\n% notes due\nFebruary 1, 2021,\nat a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nDebt Exchange -\nOn\nApril 6, 2021\n,\nwe exchanged approximately $\n1.7\nbillion of various outstanding notes and debentures due between\n2028\nand\n2065\n(Existing Notes) for $\n701\nmillion of\n2.891\n% notes due\nApril 6, 2036\n(\nNew\n2036\nNotes) and $\n1.0\nbillion of\n3.799\n% notes due\nApril 6, 2071\n(\nNew\n2071\nNotes), plus cash consideration of approximately $\n257\nmillion in addition to $\n14\nmillion for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes. In accordance with ASC\n470\n-\n50\n-\n40,\nDebt-Modifications and Extinguishments-Derecognition\n, this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange, as the exchanged debt instruments are\nnot\nconsidered to be substantially different. The cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt, and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the new notes.\nNo\ngain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. Costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately $\n13\nmillion and were included in interest expense during\n2021.\n55\nOn\nSeptember 16, 2020\n,\nwe exchanged $\n1,047\nmillion of various outstanding notes and debentures due between\nMay 1, 2037\n,\nand\nMarch 1, 2049\n(\nthe Existing Notes), for $\n1,047\nmillion of\n2.973\n% notes (the New Notes) due\nSeptember 16, 2062\n,\nplus cash consideration of approximately $\n319\nmillion in addition to $\n4\nmillion for accrued and unpaid interest on the Existing Notes. In accordance with ASC\n470\n-\n50\n-\n40,\nDebt-Modifications and Extinguishments-Derecognition\n, this transaction was accounted for as a debt exchange, as the exchanged debt instruments are\nnot\nconsidered to be substantially different. The cash consideration was recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of debt, and the balance of the unamortized discount and issue costs from the Existing Notes is being amortized as an adjustment of interest expense over the terms of the New Notes.\nNo\ngain or loss was recognized as a result of the exchange. Costs related to the debt exchange that were payable to parties other than the debt holders totaled approximately $\n9\nmillion and were included in interest expense during the quarter ended\nSeptember 30, 2020.\nCredit Facilities\n– At\nDecember 31, 2021\n, we had\n$\n2.0\nbillion of\ncredit available under our revolving credit facility, which is designated for general corporate purposes and supports the issuance of commercial paper. Credit facility withdrawals totaled\n$\n0\nd\nuring\n2021\n. Commitment fees and interest rates payable under the Facility are similar to fees and rates available to comparably rated, investment-grade borrowers. The Facility allows for borrowings at floating rates based on LIBOR, plus a spread, depending upon credit ratings for our senior unsecured debt. The\n5\n-year facility, set to expire on\nJune 8, 2023,\nrequires UPC to maintain a debt-to-EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization) coverage ratio.\nThe definition of debt used for purposes of calculating the debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio includes, among other things, certain credit arrangements, finance leases, guarantees, unfunded and vested pension benefits under Title IV of ERISA, and unamortized debt discount and deferred debt issuance costs. At\nDecember 31, 2021\n, the Company was in compliance with the debt-to-EBITDA coverage ratio, which allows us to carry up to $\n41.2\nbillion of debt (as defined in the Facility), and we had $\n31.5\nbillion of debt (as defined in the Facility) outstanding at that date. The Facility does\nnot\ninclude any other financial restrictions, credit rating triggers (other than rating-dependent pricing), or any other provision that could require us to post collateral. The Facility also includes a $\n150\nmillion cross-default provision and a change-of-control provision.\nDuring\n2021\n, we issued $\n2.1\nbillion and repaid $\n1.8\nbillion of commercial paper with maturities ranging from\n7\nto\n86\ndays. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, we had $\n400\nmillion and $\n75\nmillion of commercial paper outstanding, respectively. Our revolving credit facility supports our outstanding commercial paper balances, and, unless we change the terms of our commercial paper program, our aggregate issuance of commercial paper will\nnot\nexceed the amount of borrowings available under the Facility.\nIn\nMay 2020,\nwe entered into\nthree\nbilateral revolving credit lines, totaling $\n600\nmillion of available credit. Since entering into the\nthree\nbilateral revolving credit lines, we drew $\n300\nmillion and repaid $\n300\nmillion. All\nthree\nbilateral revolving credit lines matured by\nMay 18, 2021\n.\nShelf Registration Statement and Significant New Borrowings\n– We filed an automatic shelf registration statement with the SEC that became effective on\nFebruary 10, 2021.\nThe Board of Directors authorized the issuance of up to $\n6\nbillion of debt securities, replacing the prior Board authorization in\nNovember 2019,\nwhich had $\n2.25\nbillion of authority remaining. Under our shelf registration, we\nmay\nissue, from time to time any combination of debt securities, preferred stock, common stock, or warrants for debt securities or preferred stock in\none\nor more offerings.\nDuring\n2021\n, we issued the following unsecured, fixed-rate debt securities under our shelf registration:\nWe used the net proceeds from the offerings for general corporate purposes, including the repurchase of common stock pursuant to our share repurchase programs. These debt securities include change-of-control provisions. At\nDecember 31, 2021\n, we had remaining authority to issue up to $\n2.5\nbillion of debt securities under our shelf registration.\nOn\nFebruary 3, 2022,\nthe Board of Directors renewed its authorization for the Company to issue up to $\n12.0\nbillion of debt securities under the Shelf. This reauthorization replaces the authorization in\n2021.\nReceivables Securitization Facility\n– As of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020\n, we recorded $\n300\nmillion and $\n0\n, respectively, of borrowings under our Receivables Facility, as secured debt. (See further discussion of our receivables securitization facility in Note\n10.\n)\nLIBOR Transition\n– Each of our $\n2.0\nbillion revolving credit facility, term loan, and Receivables Facility currently use LIBOR as the benchmark for the floating interest rates. Authorities that regulate LIBOR have announced plans to phase out LIBOR so that it will, at some point, cease to exist as a benchmark for floating interest rates. To address the phase out of LIBOR, the agreements for substantially all of these facilities include a mechanism to replace LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark under specified circumstances through an amendment to the agreements. As part of this process, we will need to renegotiate our agreements to reference that alternative rate or benchmark, and\nmay\nneed to modify our existing benchmark replacement language, or obtain replacement facilities.\n56\n15.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe have entered into various lease transactions in which the structure of the leases contain variable interest entities (VIEs). These VIEs were created solely for the purpose of doing lease transactions (principally involving railroad equipment and facilities) and have\nno\nother activities, assets, or liabilities outside of the lease transactions. Within these lease arrangements, we have the right to purchase some or all of the assets at fixed prices. Depending on market conditions, fixed-price purchase options available in the leases could potentially provide benefits to us; however, these benefits are\nnot\nexpected to be significant.\nWe maintain and operate the assets based on contractual obligations within the lease arrangements, which set specific guidelines consistent within the railroad industry. As such, we have\nno\ncontrol over activities that could materially impact the fair value of the leased assets. We do\nnot\nhold the power to direct the activities of the VIEs and, therefore, do\nnot\ncontrol the ongoing activities that have a significant impact on the economic performance of the VIEs. Additionally, we do\nnot\nhave the obligation to absorb losses of the VIEs or the right to receive benefits of the VIEs that could potentially be significant to the VIEs.\nWe are\nnot\nconsidered to be the primary beneficiary and do\nnot\nconsolidate these VIEs because our actions and decisions do\nnot\nhave the most significant effect on the VIE’s performance and our fixed-price purchase options are\nnot\nconsidered to be potentially significant to the VIEs. The future minimum lease payments associated with the VIE leases totaled $\n1.1\nbillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n, and are recorded as operating lease liabilities at present value in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\n16.\nLeases\nWe lease certain locomotives, freight cars, and other property for use in our rail operations.\nThe following are additional details related to our lease portfolio:\nThe lease cost components are classified as follows:\n57\nThe following table presents aggregate lease maturities as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n:\nThe following table presents the weighted average remaining lease term and discount rate:\nThe following table presents other information related to our operating and finance leases for the years ended\nDecember 31:\n17.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAsserted and Unasserted Claims\n– Various claims and lawsuits are pending against us and certain of our subsidiaries. We cannot fully determine the effect of all asserted and unasserted claims on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity. To the extent possible, we have recorded a liability where asserted and unasserted claims are considered probable and where such claims can be reasonably estimated. We do\nnot\nexpect that any known lawsuits, claims, environmental costs, commitments, contingent liabilities, or guarantees will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity after taking into account liabilities and insurance recoveries previously recorded for these matters.\nPersonal Injury\n– The Federal Employers’ Liability Act (FELA) governs compensation for work-related accidents. Under FELA, damages are assessed based on a finding of fault through litigation or out-of-court settlements. We offer a comprehensive variety of services and rehabilitation programs for employees who are injured at work.\nApproximately\n94\n% of the recorded liability is related to asserted claims and approximately\n6\n% is related to unasserted claims at\nDecember 31, 2021\n. Because of the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate outcome of personal injury claims, it is reasonably possible that future costs to settle these claims\nmay\nrange from approximately $\n325\nmillion to $\n358\nmillion. We record an accrual at the low end of the range as\nno\namount of loss within the range is more probable than any other. Estimates can vary over time due to evolving trends in litigation.\n58\nOur personal injury liability activity was as follows:\nEnvironmental Costs\n– We are subject to federal, state, and local environmental laws and regulations. We have identified\n376\nsites where we are or\nmay\nbe liable for remediation costs associated with alleged contamination or for violations of environmental requirements. This includes\n28\nsites that are the subject of actions taken by the U.S. government,\n18\nof which are currently on the Superfund National Priorities List. Certain federal legislation imposes joint and several liability for the remediation of identified sites; consequently, our ultimate environmental liability\nmay\ninclude costs relating to activities of other parties, in addition to costs relating to our own activities at each site.\nOur environmental liability activity was as follows:\nThe environmental liability includes future costs for remediation and restoration of sites, as well as ongoing monitoring costs, but excludes any anticipated recoveries from\nthird\n-parties. Cost estimates are based on information available for each site, financial viability of other potentially responsible parties, and existing technology, laws, and regulations. The ultimate liability for remediation is difficult to determine because of the number of potentially responsible parties, site-specific cost sharing arrangements with other potentially responsible parties, the degree of contamination by various wastes, the scarcity and quality of volumetric data related to many of the sites, and the speculative nature of remediation costs. Estimates of liability\nmay\nvary over time due to changes in federal, state, and local laws governing environmental remediation. Current obligations are\nnot\nexpected to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial condition, or liquidity.\nInsurance\n– The Company has a consolidated, wholly-owned captive insurance subsidiary (the captive), that provides insurance coverage for certain risks including FELA claims and property coverage that are subject to reinsurance. The captive entered into annual reinsurance treaty agreements that insure workers compensation, general liability, auto liability, and FELA risk. The captive cedes a portion of its FELA exposure through the treaty and assumes a proportionate share of the entire risk. The captive receives direct premiums, which are netted against the Company’s premium costs in other expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The treaty agreements provide for certain protections against the risk of treaty participants’ non-performance, and we do\nnot\nbelieve our exposure to treaty participants’ non-performance is material at this time. We record both liabilities and reinsurance receivables using an actuarial analysis based on historical experience in our Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Effective\nJanuary 2019,\nthe captive insurance subsidiary\nno\nlonger participates in the reinsurance treaty agreement. The Company established a trust in the\nfourth\nquarter of\n2018\nfor the purpose of providing collateral as required under the reinsurance treaty agreement for prior years’ participation.\nIndemnities\n– Our maximum potential exposure under indemnification arrangements, including certain tax indemnifications, can range from a specified dollar amount to an unlimited amount, depending on the nature of the transactions and the agreements. Due to uncertainty as to whether claims will be made or how they will be resolved, we cannot reasonably determine the probability of an adverse claim or reasonably estimate any adverse liability or the total maximum exposure under these indemnification arrangements. We do\nnot\nhave any reason to believe that we will be required to make any material payments under these indemnity provisions.\n59\n18.\nShare Repurchase Programs\nEffective\nApril 1, 2019,\nour Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to\n150\nmillion shares of our common stock by\nMarch 31, 2022,\nreplacing our previous repurchase program. These repurchases\nmay\nbe made on the open market or through other transactions. Our management has sole discretion with respect to determining the timing and amount of these transactions. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\n, we repurchased a total of $\n48.2\nbillion of our common stock since commencement of our repurchase programs in\n2007.\nThe table below represents shares repurchased under repurchase programs during\n2021\nand\n2020\n:\nManagement's assessments of market conditions and other pertinent factors guide the timing and volume of all repurchases. We expect to fund any share repurchases under this program through cash generated from operations, the sale or lease of various operating and non-operating properties, debt issuances, and cash on hand. Open market repurchases are recorded in treasury stock at cost, which includes any applicable commissions and fees.\nFrom\nJanuary 1, 2022,\nthrough\nFebruary 3, 2022,\nwe repurchased\n2.4\nmillion shares at an aggregate cost of approximately\n$590\nmillion.\nOn\nFebruary 3, 2022,\nthe Board of Directors approved a new share repurchase authorization, enabling the Company to buy up to\n100\nmillion of its common shares by\nMarch 31, 2025.\nThe new authorization is effective\nApril 1, 2022,\nand replaces the current authorization, which will expire on\nMarch 31, 2022.\nAccelerated Share Repurchase Programs\n– The Company has established accelerated share repurchase programs (ASRs) with financial institutions to repurchase shares of our common stock. These ASRs have been structured so that at the time of commencement, we pay a specified amount to the financial institutions and receive an initial delivery of shares. Additional shares\nmay\nbe received at the time of settlement. The final number of shares to be received is based on the volume weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the ASR term, less a discount and subject to potential adjustments pursuant to the terms of such ASR.\nOn\nMay 26, 2021,\nthe Company received\n7,209,156\nshares of its common stock repurchased under ASRs for an aggregate of $\n2.0\nbillion. Upon settlement of these ASRs in the\nthird\nquarter of\n2021,\nwe received\n1,983,859\nadditional shares.\nOn\nFebruary 19, 2020,\nthe Company received\n8,786,380\nshares of its common stock repurchased under ASRs for an aggregate of $\n2.0\nbillion. Upon settlement of these ASRs in the\nthird\nquarter of\n2020,\nwe received\n4,045,575\nadditional shares.\nASRs are accounted for as equity transactions, and at the time of receipt, shares are included in treasury stock at fair market value as of the corresponding initiation or settlement date.

    "text": "As of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of the Corporation’s management, including the Corporation’s Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer (CFO), of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives. Based upon that evaluation, the CEO and the CFO concluded that, as of the end of the period covered by this report, the Corporation’s disclosure controls and procedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed in our Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified by the SEC, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including the CEO and CFO, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nAdditionally, the CEO and CFO determined that there were no changes to the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)) during the last fiscal quarter that materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting.\nMANAGEMENT\n’\nS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the Corporation) is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f)). The Corporation’s internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance to the Corporation’s management and Board of Directors regarding the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and presentation.\nThe Corporation’s management assessed the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\n. Based on our assessment, management believes that, as of December 31, 2021, the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe Corporation’s independent registered public accounting firm has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting. This report appears on the next page.\nFebruary 3, 2022\n61\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Union Pacific Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Union Pacific Corporation and Subsidiary Companies (the “Corporation”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Corporation maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n—\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Corporation and our report dated February 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Corporation’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement\n’\ns Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Corporation in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nOmaha, Nebraska\nFebruary 4, 2022\n62"
