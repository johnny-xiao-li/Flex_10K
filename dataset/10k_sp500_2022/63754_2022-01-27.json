    "text": "McCormick is a global leader in flavor. We manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry–retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We also are partners in a number of joint ventures that are involved in the manufacture and sale of flavorful products, the most significant of which is McCormick de Mexico. Our major sales, distribution and production facilities are located in North America, Europe and China. Additional facilities are based in Australia, Central America, Thailand and South Africa.\nOn December 30, 2020, we completed the purchase of FONA International, LLC and certain of its affiliates (FONA), a privately held company. The purchase price was approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets. The acquisition of FONA broadens our value-add offerings with products that are highly complementary to our existing portfolio. By combining the portfolios and infrastructures, we have added manufacturing capacity as well as greater scale and expect to accelerate our global flavor growth. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of FONA were approximately $114 million. The results of FONA’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our flavor solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\nOn November 30, 2020, we completed the purchase of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce\n®\n(Cholula) from\nL\nCatterton. The purchase price was approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired. Cholula, a premium Mexican hot sauce brand, is a strong addition to McCormick’s global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens the Company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of Cholula were approximately $96 million. The results of Cholula’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.\nIn August 2017, we completed the acquisition of Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division (RB Foods) from Reckitt Benckiser Group plc. The purchase price was approximately $4.2 billion. The iconic brands we acquired from RB Foods included French’s\n®\n, Frank’s RedHot\n®\nand Cattlemen’s\n®\n, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions moved us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. Condiments category, while providing significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments.\nBusiness Segments\nWe operate in two business segments, consumer and flavor solutions. Demand for flavor is growing globally, and across both segments we have the customer base and product breadth to participate in all types of eating occasions. Our products deliver flavor when cooking at home, dining out, purchasing a quick service meal or enjoying a snack. We offer our customers and consumers a range of products to meet the increasing demand for certain product attributes such as clean-label, organic, natural, reduced sodium, gluten-free and non-GMO (genetically modified organisms) and that extend from premium to value-priced.\nConsistent with market conditions in each segment, our consumer segment has a higher overall profit margin than our flavor solutions segment. In 2021, the consumer segment contributed approximately 62% of consolidated net sales and 75% of consolidated operating income, and the flavor solutions segment contributed approximately 38% of consolidated net sales and 25% of consolidated operating income.\nConsumer Segment.\nFrom locations around the world, our brands reach consumers in approximately 160 countries and territories. Our leading brands in the Americas include McCormick\n®\n, French’s\n®\n, Frank’s RedHot\n®\n, Lawry’s\n®\nCholula Hot Sauce\n®\nand Club House\n®\n, as well as brands such as Gourmet Garden\n®\nand OLD BAY\n®\n. We also market authentic regional and ethnic brands such as Zatarain’s\n®\n, Stubb's\n®\n, Thai Kitchen\n®\nand Simply Asia\n®\n. In the Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) region, our major brands include the Ducros\n®\n, Schwartz\n®\n,\nKamis\n®\nand Drogheria & Alimentari\n®\nbrands of spices, herbs and seasonings and an extensive line of Vahiné\n®\nbrand dessert items. In China, we market our products under the McCormick and DaQiao\n®\nbrands. In Australia, we market our spices and\n2\nseasonings under the McCormick brand, our dessert products under the Aeroplane\n®\nbrand, and packaged chilled herbs under the Gourmet Garden brand. Elsewhere in the Asia/Pacific region, we market our products under the McCormick brand as well as other brands.\nApproximately two thirds of our consumer segment sales are spices and seasonings and condiments and sauces.\nWithin the spices and seasoning category, we are the brand leader globally and a category leader in our key markets. In the condiments and sauces category, we are one of the brand leaders globally and in the U.S.\nThere are numerous competitive brands of spices and seasonings, and condiments and sauces in the U.S. and additional brands in international markets. Some are owned by large food manufacturers, while others are supplied by small privately-owned companies. In this competitive environment, we are leading with innovation and brand marketing, and applying our analytical tools to help customers optimize the profitability of their sales of these categories while simultaneously working to increase our sales and profit.\nOur customers span a variety of retailers that include grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, and e-commerce retailers served directly and indirectly through distributors or wholesalers. In addition to marketing our branded products to these customers, we are also a leading supplier of private label items, also known as store brands. In our businesses in China and India, foodservice sales are managed by and reported in our consumer segment.\nFlavor Solutions Segment.\nIn our flavor solutions segment, we provide a wide range of products to multinational food manufacturers and foodservice customers. The foodservice customers are supplied with branded, packaged products both directly by us and indirectly through distributors, with the exception of our businesses in China and India, where foodservice sales are managed by and reported in our consumer segment. We supply food manufacturers and foodservice customers with customized flavor solutions, and many of these customer relationships have been active for decades. Our range of flavor solutions remains one of the broadest in the industry and includes seasoning blends, spices and herbs, condiments, coating systems and compound flavors. In addition to a broad range of flavor solutions, our long-standing customer relationships are evidence of our effectiveness in building customer intimacy. Our customers benefit from our expertise in many areas, including sensory testing, culinary research, food safety and flavor application.\nOur flavor solutions segment has a number of competitors. Some tend to specialize in a particular range of products and have a limited geographic reach. Other competitors include large publicly held flavor companies that are more global in nature, but which also tend to focus on providing integrated solutions extending beyond flavor through the use of other functional and nutritional ingredients.\nRaw Materials\nThe most significant raw materials used in our business are dairy products, pepper, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, vanilla, garlic, and salt. Pepper and other spices and herbs are generally sourced from countries other than the United States. Other raw materials, like dairy products and onion, are primarily sourced locally, either within the United States or from our international locations. Because the raw materials are agricultural products, they are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, market conditions, and other factors beyond our control.\nWe respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments and cost savings from our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program.\nIn addition, we rely on third-party transportation providers to deliver raw materials as well as our product to our customers. Reduced availability of transportation capacity due to labor shortages, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers.\nCustomers\nOur products are sold directly to customers and also through brokers, wholesalers and distributors. In the consumer segment, products are then sold to consumers under a number of brands through a variety of retail channels, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, and e-commerce. In the flavor solutions segment, products are used by food and beverage manufacturers as ingredients for their finished goods and by foodservice customers as ingredients for menu items, as well as provided to their own customers for use in dine-in and take-out eating occasions, all to enhance the flavor of their foods. Customers for the flavor solutions segment include food manufacturers and the foodservice industry supplied through a variety of channels including directly and indirectly through distributors, wholesale foodservice suppliers and e-commerce.\n3\nWe have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer segment customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated sales in 2021 and 2020 and 12% of consolidated sales in 2019. Sales to one of our flavor solutions segment customers, PepsiCo, Inc., accounted for approximately 11% of consolidated sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the top three customers in our flavor solutions segment represented between 48% and 52% of our global flavor solutions sales.\nTrademarks, Licenses and Patents\nWe own a number of trademark registrations. Although in the aggregate these trademarks are material to our business, the loss of any one of those trademarks, with the exception of our “McCormick,” “French’s\n,” “Frank’s RedHot,” “Lawry’s,” “Zatarain’s,” “Cholula,” “Stubb's,” “Club House,” “Ducros,” “Schwartz,” “Vahiné,” \"OLD BAY,\" \"Simply Asia,\" \"Thai Kitchen,\" \"Kitchen Basics,\" “Kamis,” “Drogheria & Alimentari,” \"DaQiao,\" and \"Gourmet Garden\" trademarks, would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The “Mc – McCormick” trademark is extensively used by us in connection with the sale of our food products in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. markets. The terms of the trademark registrations are as prescribed by law, and the registrations will be renewed for as long as we deem them to be useful.\nWe have entered into a number of license agreements authorizing the use of our trademarks by affiliated and non-affiliated entities. The loss of these license agreements would not have a material adverse effect on our business. The term of the license agreements is generally two to three years or until such time as either party terminates the agreement. Those agreements with specific terms may be renewable upon agreement of the parties.\nWe also own various patents, none of which are individually material to our business.\nSeasonality\nDue to seasonal factors inherent in our business, our sales, income and cash from operations generally are lower in the first two quarters of the fiscal year, increase in the third quarter and are significantly higher in the fourth quarter due to the holiday season. This seasonality reflects customer and consumer buying patterns, primarily in the consumer segment.\nWorking Capital\nIn order to meet increased demand for our consumer products during our fourth quarter, we usually build our inventories during the third quarter of the fiscal year. We generally finance working capital items (inventory and receivables) through short-term borrowings, which include the use of lines of credit and the issuance of commercial paper. For a description of our liquidity and capital resources, see note 6 of the accompanying financial statements and the “Liquidity and Financial Condition” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.”\nCompetition\nEach segment operates in markets around the world that are highly competitive. In this competitive environment, our growth strategies include customer engagement and product innovation based on consumer insights. Additionally, in the consumer segment, we are building brand recognition and loyalty through advertising and promotions. Additionally, in our flavor solutions segment, we are differentiated by our culinary and consumer inspired flavor development as well the breadth of our product offering and customer engagement.\nGovernmental Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations around the world that apply to our global businesses. In the United States, the safety, production, transportation, distribution, advertising, labeling and sale of many of our products and their ingredients are subject to the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act; the Food Safety Modernization Act; the Federal Trade Commission Act; state consumer protection laws; competition laws, anti-corruption laws, customs and trade laws; federal, state and local workplace health and safety laws; various federal, state and local environmental protection laws; and various other federal, state and local statutes and regulations. Outside the United States, our business is subject to numerous similar statutes, laws and regulatory requirements.\nHuman Capital\nWe believe in the Power of People – our employees and customers across the world.  Our high-performance culture is rooted in our shared values and respect for all contributions of every employee. Our key human capital objectives are to attract, retain and develop the highest quality talent. We employ various human resource programs in support of these objectives. We believe diversity, equity and inclusion are at the core of our values and strategic business priorities.  Throughout our business, we champion equality, supporting parity for women and under-represented groups as we work to create ethical, safe and supportive workplaces where our employees thrive.  We believe a diverse and inclusive workplace results in business growth and encourages increased innovation, retention of talent and a more engaged workforce.  We have various employee ambassador groups that provide a supportive,\n4\ncollaborative space for employees to come together to promote inclusion. Respect for human rights is fundamental to our business and its commitment to ethical business conduct.\nWe had approximately 14,000 full-time employees worldwide as of November 30, 2021. Our operations have not been affected significantly by work stoppages, other than those associated with temporary closures of plants related to the COVID-19 pandemic in fiscal 2020 and, in the opinion of management, employee relations are good. Since the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, our employees have demonstrated resiliency, agility and engagement in support of business continuity despite the challenges that have arisen in the pandemic. We have approximately 400 employees in the United States who are covered by a collective bargaining contract. At our subsidiaries outside the U.S., approximately 2,600 employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or similar arrangements.\nThrough our continuous listening strategy, we measure employee engagement on an ongoing basis to solicit feedback and understand views of our employees, work environment and culture. The results from these surveys are used to implement programs and processes designed to enhance employee engagement and improve the employee experience.\nWe are committed to the safety, health, and security of our employees.  We believe a hazard-free environment is a critical enabler for the success of our business.  Throughout our operations, we strive to ensure that all of our employees have access to safe workplaces that allow them to succeed in their jobs.\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nIn addition to the executive officers indicated in the 2022 Proxy Statement incorporated by reference in Part III, Item 10 of this Report, the other executive officer of McCormick is Lisa B. Manzone.\nMs. Manzone is 57 years old and has held the position of Senior Vice President, Human Relations since June 2015.\nOperations Outside of the U.S.\nWe are subject in varying degrees to certain risks typically associated with a global business, such as local economic and market conditions, exchange rate fluctuations, and restrictions on investments, royalties and dividends. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 40% of sales were from non-U.S. operations. For information on how we manage some of these risks, see the “Market Risk Sensitivity” section of “Management’s Discussion and Analysis.”\nForward-Looking Information\nCertain statements contained in this report, including statements concerning expected performance such as those relating to net sales, gross margin, earnings, cost savings, transaction and integration expenses, special charges, acquisitions, brand marketing support, volume and product mix, income tax expense, and the impact of foreign currency rates are “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

    "text": "The following are certain risk factors that could affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. These risk factors should be considered in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K because these factors could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. Before you buy our Common Stock or Common Stock Non-Voting, you should know that making such an investment involves risks, including the risks described below. Additional risks and uncertainties that are not presently known to us or are currently deemed to be immaterial also may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations in the future. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be negatively affected. In that case, the trading price of our securities could decline, and you may lose part or all of your investment.\nRisks Related to Our Company, Business and Operations\nA pandemic, including COVID-19, could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition, and results of operations.\n6\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had, and could continue to have, a negative impact on financial markets, economic conditions, and portions of our industry as a result of changes in consumer behavior, retailer inventory levels, cost inflation, manufacturing and supply chain disruption, and overall macroeconomic conditions. The extent and nature of government actions, including limitations on crowd size, closures of dine-in restaurants and bars, and significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibited many employees from going to work, varied during fiscal 2020 and 2021 based upon the then-current extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic within the respective countries and localities. Although our consumer business has benefited from increased at-home consumption due to restrictions related to COVID-19, our ability to sustain heightened sales is dependent on consumer purchasing behavior. The COVID-19 mitigation measures impacting certain of our flavor solutions customers have included the following: (i) with respect to dine-in restaurants, closures, limitations on dine-in capacity, or restrictions on the operations of those restaurants to carry-out or delivery only; and (ii) with respect to quick service restaurants, limitations on operations to drive-through pick-up or delivery. The continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments may partially mitigate the risks around the continued spread of COVID-19, however, with the spread of the COVID-19 variants, the ongoing implications of the COVID-19 pandemic could adversely impact our business and results of operations in a number of ways, including but not limited to:\n•\nSignificant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for one or more of our products, which may be caused by, among other things: the temporary inability of consumers to purchase our products due to illness, quarantine or other travel restrictions, or financial hardship, shifts in demand away from one or more of our more discretionary or higher priced products to lower priced products, or stockpiling or similar activity. If prolonged, such impacts can further increase the difficulty of business or operations planning and may adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows;\n•\nInability to meet our customers’ needs and achieve cost targets due to disruptions in our manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by constrained workforce capacity or the loss or disruption of other essential manufacturing and supply elements such as raw materials or other finished product components, transportation, enhanced cleaning and sanitation protocols, or other manufacturing and distribution capability;\n•\nFailure of third parties on which we rely, including our suppliers, contract manufacturers, distributors, contractors, commercial banks, joint venture partners and external business partners, to meet their obligations to the Company, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, which may be caused by their own financial or operational difficulties and may adversely impact our operations; or\n•\nSignificant changes in the political conditions in markets in which we manufacture, sell or distribute our products, including quarantines, import/export restrictions, price controls, or governmental or regulatory actions, closures or other restrictions that limit or close our operating and manufacturing facilities, restrict our employees’ ability to travel or perform necessary business functions, or otherwise prevent our third-party partners, suppliers, or customers from sufficiently staffing operations, including operations necessary for the production, distribution, sale, and support of our products, which could adversely impact our results of operations and cash flows.\nThe duration and extent of the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic depends on future developments that cannot\nbe accurately predicted at this time, such as the severity and transmission rate of the virus, the emergence and spread of variants, infection rates in areas where we operate, the extent and effectiveness of containment actions, including the continued availability and effectiveness of vaccines in the markets where we operate, the impact of actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic, each of which is uncertain, rapidly changing and difficult to predict, and the impact of these and other factors on our employees, customers, and suppliers. Should these conditions persist for a prolonged period, including any of the above factors and others that are currently unknown, the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, and results of operations. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in this Item 1A,\nRisk Factors\n, any of which could have a material effect on us.\nDamage to our reputation or brand name, loss of brand relevance, increase in use of private label or other competitive brands by customers or consumers, or product quality or safety concerns could negatively impact our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have many iconic brands with long-standing consumer recognition.  Our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products, extend our brands to new platforms, and expand our brand image with new product offerings.\n7\nWe continually make efforts to maintain and improve relationships with our customers and consumers and to increase awareness and relevance of our brands through effective marketing and other measures. From time to time, our customers reevaluate their mix of product offerings, and consumers have the option to purchase private label or other competitive products instead of our branded products. In the event that we are unable to supply our products to customers in the time frame and quantities that they desire, whether due to increased demand or other factors, our customers may discontinue all or a portion of their purchases from us and source competitive brands. If a significant portion of our branded business was switched to private label or competitive products, it could have a material negative impact on our consumer segment.\nOur reputation for manufacturing high-quality products is widely recognized. In order to safeguard that reputation, we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our products.  A serious breach of our quality assurance or quality control procedures, deterioration of our quality image, impairment of our customer or consumer relationships or failure to adequately protect the relevance of our brands may lead to litigation, customers purchasing from our competitors or consumers purchasing other brands or private label items that may or may not be manufactured by us, any of which could have a material negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe food industry generally is subject to risks posed by food spoilage and contamination, product tampering, product recall, import alerts and consumer product liability claims. For instance, we may be required to recall certain of our products should they be mislabeled, contaminated or damaged. Additionally, certain of our raw materials could be blocked from entering the country if they were subject to government-imposed actions. We have and may continue to become involved in lawsuits and legal proceedings if it is alleged that the consumption of any of our products could cause injury or illness, or that any of our products are mislabeled or fail to meet applicable legal requirements (even if the allegation is untrue). A product recall, import alert or an adverse result in any such litigation, or negative perceptions regarding food products and ingredients, could result in our having to pay fines or damages, incur additional costs or cause customers and consumers in our principal markets to lose confidence in the safety and quality of certain products or ingredients, any of which could have a negative effect on our business or financial results and, depending upon the significance of the affected product, that negative effect could be material to our business or financial results. Negative publicity about these concerns, whether or not valid, may discourage customers and consumers from buying our products or cause disruptions in production or distribution of our products and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe rising popularity of social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies has increased the speed and accessibility of information dissemination (whether or not accurate), and, as a result, negative, inaccurate, or misleading posts or comments on websites may generate adverse publicity that could damage our reputation or brands.\nCustomer consolidation, consumer behaviors, and competitive, economic and other pressures facing our customers, may impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nA number of our customers, such as supermarkets, warehouse clubs and food distributors, have consolidated in recent years and consolidation could continue. Such consolidation could present a challenge to margin growth and profitability in that it has produced large, sophisticated customers with increased buying power who are more capable of operating with reduced inventories; resisting price increases; demanding lower pricing, increased promotional programs and specifically tailored products; and shifting shelf space currently used for our products to private label and other competitive products. The economic and competitive landscape for our customers is constantly changing, such as the emergence of new sales channels like e-commerce, and our customers' responses to those changes could impact our business. The trend towards e-commerce and its impact of consumer habits and preferences has accelerated since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in many of the markets we serve and our financial results may be impacted if we are unable to adapt to changing consumer preferences and market dynamics. In addition, our flavor solutions segment may be impacted if the reputation or perception of the customers of our flavor solutions segment declines. These factors could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have a number of major customers, including two large customers that, in the aggregate, constituted approximately 22% of our consolidated sales in 2021. The loss of either of these large customers due to events beyond our control, or a material negative change in our relationship with these large customers or other major customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\n8\nIssues regarding procurement of raw materials may negatively impact us.\nOur purchases of raw materials are subject to fluctuations in market price and availability caused by weather, growing and harvesting conditions, climate change, market conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control, including the COVID-19 pandemic. The most significant raw materials used by us in our business are dairy products, pepper, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, vanilla, garlic, and salt. While future price movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we seek to mitigate the market price risk in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery, customer price adjustments and cost savings from our CCI program. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk. To the extent that we have used derivatives for this purpose, it has not been material to our business. Any actions we take in response to market price fluctuations may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in raw material prices. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material price fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIn addition, we may have very little opportunity to mitigate the risk of availability of certain raw materials due to the effect of weather on crop yield, government actions, political unrest in producing countries, action or inaction by suppliers in response to laws and regulations, changes in agricultural programs and other factors beyond our control. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future raw material availability will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nPolitical, socio-economic and cultural conditions, as well as disruptions caused by terrorist activities or otherwise, could also create additional risks for regulatory compliance. Although we have adopted rigorous quality assurance and quality control procedures which are designed to ensure the safety of our imported products, we cannot provide assurance that such events will not have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nDisruption of our supply chain could adversely affect our business.\nOur ability to make, move, and sell products is critical to our success. Damage or disruption to raw material supplies or our manufacturing or distribution capabilities due to weather, climate change, natural disaster, fire, terrorism, cyber-attack, pandemics (such as the COVID-19 pandemic), governmental restrictions or mandates, strikes, import/export restrictions, or other factors could impair our ability to manufacture or sell our products. Many of our product lines are manufactured at a single location. The failure of third parties on which we rely, including those third parties who supply our ingredients, packaging, capital equipment and other necessary operating materials, contract manufacturers, commercial transport, distributors, contractors, and external business partners, to meet their obligations to us, or significant disruptions in their ability to do so, may negatively impact our operations. Our suppliers’ policies and practices can damage our reputation and the quality and safety of our products. Disputes with significant suppliers, including disputes regarding pricing or performance, could adversely affect our ability to supply products to our customers and could materially and adversely affect our sales, financial condition, and results of operations. Failure to take adequate steps to mitigate the likelihood or potential impact of such events, or to effectively manage such events if they occur, particularly when a product is manufactured from a single location, could adversely affect our business and results of operations, as well as require additional resources to restore our supply chain.\nMoreover, short term or sustained increases in consumer demand at our customers may exceed our production capacity or otherwise strain our supply chain. Our failure to meet the demand for our products could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nOur results of operations can be adversely affected by labor shortages, turnover and labor cost increases.\nLabor is a primary component of operating our business. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to us or increase labor costs, including high unemployment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and other government regulations. We are also experiencing and may continue to experience additional pressure in our supply chain due to labor shortages and absenteeism associated with COVID-19, together with the impact of the continued elevated demand.\nA sustained labor shortage or increased turnover rates within our employee base, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could lead to increased costs, such as increased overtime to meet demand and increased wage rates to attract and retain employees, and could negatively affect our ability to efficiently operate our manufacturing and distribution facilities and overall business. If we are unable to hire and retain employees capable of performing at a high-level, or if mitigation measures we may take to respond to a decrease in labor availability, such as overtime and third-party outsourcing, have negative effects, our business could be adversely affected. In addition, we distribute our products and receive raw materials primarily by truck. Reduced availability of trucking capacity due to shortages of drivers, primarily as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, has caused an increase in the cost of transportation for us and our suppliers.\nAn overall labor shortage,\n9\nlack of skilled labor, increased turnover or labor inflation, caused by COVID-19 or as a result of general macroeconomic factors, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or operating results.\nWe may not be able to increase prices to fully offset inflationary pressures on costs, such as raw and packaging materials, labor and distribution costs, which may impact our financial condition or results of operations.\nAs a manufacturer and distributor of flavor products, we rely on raw materials, packaging materials, plant labor, distribution resources, and transportation providers. In 2021 and the early part of 2022, the costs of raw materials, packaging materials, labor, energy, fuel, transportation and other inputs necessary for the production and distribution of our products have rapidly increased. In addition, many of these materials are subject to price fluctuations from a number of factors, including, but not limited to, market conditions, demand for raw materials, weather, growing and harvesting conditions, climate change,\nenergy costs, currency fluctuations, supplier capacities, governmental actions, import and export requirements (including tariffs),\nand other factors beyond our control.\nAlthough we are unable to predict the impact on our ability to source materials in the future, we expect these supply pressures to continue into 2022. We also expect the pressures of input cost inflation to continue into 2022.\nOur attempts to offset these cost pressures, such as through increases in the selling prices of some of our products, may not be successful. Higher product prices may result in reductions in sales volume. Consumers may be less willing to pay a price differential for our branded products and may increasingly purchase lower-priced offerings, or may forego some purchases altogether, during an economic downturn. To the extent that price increases or packaging size decreases are not sufficient to offset these increased costs adequately or in a timely manner, and/or if they result in significant decreases in sales volume, our business, financial condition or operating results may be adversely affected. Furthermore, we may not be able to offset any cost increases through productivity initiatives or through our commodity hedging activity.\nOur profitability may suffer as a result of competition in our markets.\nThe food industry is intensely competitive. Competition in our product categories is based on price, product innovation, product quality, brand recognition and loyalty, effectiveness of marketing and promotional activity, and the ability to identify and satisfy consumer preferences. From time to time, we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures, which may adversely affect our profitability. Such pressures could reduce our ability to take appropriate remedial action to address commodity and other cost increases.\nOur operations may be impaired as a result of disasters, business interruptions or similar events.\nWe could have an interruption in our business, loss of inventory or data, or be rendered unable to accept and fulfill customer orders as a result of a natural disaster, catastrophic event, epidemic or computer system failure. Natural disasters could include an earthquake, fire, flood, tornado or severe storm. A catastrophic event could include a terrorist attack. An epidemic or pandemic could affect our operations, major facilities or employees’ and consumers’ health. In addition, some of our inventory and production facilities are located in areas that are susceptible to harsh weather; a major storm, heavy snowfall or other similar event could prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner. Production of certain of our products is concentrated in a single manufacturing site.\nWe cannot provide assurance that our disaster recovery plan will address all of the issues we may encounter in the event of a disaster or other unanticipated issue, and our business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for losses that may occur from any of the foregoing. In the event that a natural disaster, terrorist attack or other catastrophic event were to destroy any part of our facilities or interrupt our operations for any extended period of time, or if harsh weather or health conditions prevent us from delivering products in a timely manner, our business, financial condition or operating results could be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to successfully consummate and manage ongoing acquisition, joint venture and divestiture activities which could have an impact on our results.\nFrom time to time, we may acquire other businesses and, based on an evaluation of our business portfolio, divest existing businesses. These acquisitions, joint ventures and divestitures may present financial, managerial and operational challenges, including diversion of management attention from existing businesses, difficulty with integrating or separating personnel and financial and other systems, increased expenses and raw material costs, assumption of unknown liabilities and indemnities, and potential disputes with the buyers or sellers. In addition, we\n10\nmay be required to incur asset impairment charges (including charges related to goodwill and other intangible assets) in connection with acquired businesses, which may reduce our profitability. If we are unable to consummate such transactions, or successfully integrate and grow acquisitions and achieve contemplated revenue synergies and cost savings, our financial results could be adversely affected. Additionally, joint ventures inherently involve a lesser degree of control over business operations, thereby potentially increasing the financial, legal, operational, and/or compliance risks.\nAn impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets could adversely affect our results.\nAs of November 30, 2021, we had approximately $5.3 billion of goodwill and approximately $3.5 billion of other indefinite-lived intangible assets. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are initially recorded at fair value and not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually or more frequently if impairment indicators arise. We test goodwill at the reporting unit level by comparing the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit, including goodwill, to the unit's fair value. Similarly, we test indefinite-lived intangible assets by comparing the fair value of those assets to their carrying values. If the carrying values of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible assets exceed their fair value, the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets are considered impaired and reduced to their implied fair value or fair value, respectively. Factors that could result in an impairment include a change in revenue growth rates, operating margins, weighted average cost of capital, future economic and market conditions, higher income tax rates, or assumed royalty rates. The impairment of our goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets would have a negative impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nBecause indefinite-lived intangible assets are recorded at fair value at the date of acquisition of the related business, indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with recent business acquisitions, particularly those acquired in recent low interest rate environments, such as Cholula and FONA, are more susceptible to impairment in periods of rising interest rates than indefinite-lived intangible assets related to businesses acquired in periods of higher interest rates.\nStreamlining actions to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness may have a negative effect on employee relations.\nWe regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance that we may transfer production from one manufacturing facility to another; transfer certain selling and administrative functions from one location to another; eliminate certain manufacturing, selling and administrative positions; and exit certain businesses or lines of business. These actions may result in a deterioration of employee relations at the impacted locations or elsewhere in McCormick.\nIf we are unable to fully realize the benefits from our CCI program, our financial results could be negatively affected.\nOur future success depends in part on our ability to be an efficient producer in a highly competitive industry. Any failure by us to achieve our planned cost savings and efficiencies under our CCI program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization, or other similar programs, could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial position.\nFluctuations in foreign currency markets may negatively impact us.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar,  Australian dollar, Polish zloty, and Mexican peso, as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling and Australian dollar, and finally the Canadian dollar versus British pound sterling. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to facilitate managing certain of these foreign currency risks. However, these contracts may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to a decline in operating results due to foreign currency exchange changes. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future exchange rate fluctuations will not have a negative impact on our business, financial position or operating results.\nThe on-going effects of the decision by British voters to exit the European Union may negatively impact our operations.\n11\nOn January 1, 2021, the EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement (the EU-UK trade deal) took effect. The EU-UK trade deal was formally approved by the European Union legislature on April 28, 2021. While the EU-UK trade deal has removed uncertainty and a significant amount of financial risk associated with the U.K.’s exit from the European Union, we are still assessing its details and related impact on our U.K business and other operations. We believe that the new trading relationship between the U.K and the European Union will result in increased costs of goods imported into the U.K. from the European Union and exported from the U.K. into the European Union. The movement of goods between the U.K. and the European Union will continue to be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure. Also, there will be additional costs related to goods that are deemed to originate outside of the U.K. or European Union, and for which the originating country has no trade agreement with the U.K. Our ability to increase pricing of our products in light of increased costs is uncertain and, to the extent we are unable to fully do so, our profitability will decline.\nWe face risks associated with certain pension assets and obligations.\nWe hold investments in equity and debt securities in our qualified defined benefit pension plans and in a rabbi trust for our U.S. non-qualified pension plan. Deterioration in the value of plan assets resulting from a general financial downturn or otherwise, or an increase in the actuarial valuation of the plans' liability due to a low interest rate environment, could cause (or increase) an underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans, thereby increasing our obligation to make contributions to the plans. An obligation to make contributions to pension plans could reduce the cash available for working capital and other corporate uses, and may have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nClimate change may negatively affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nUnseasonable or unusual weather or long-term climate changes may negatively impact the price or availability of spices, herbs and other raw materials. Scientific consensus shows that greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have an adverse impact on global temperatures, weather patterns and the frequency and severity of extreme weather and natural disasters. In the event that such climate change has a negative effect on agricultural productivity or practices, we may be subject to decreased availability or less favorable pricing for certain commodities that are necessary for our products. As a result of climate change, we may also be subjected to decreased availability of water, deteriorated quality of water or less favorable pricing for water, which could adversely impact our manufacturing and distribution operations. In addition, such climate change may result in modifications to the eating preferences of the ultimate consumers of certain of our products, which may also unfavorably impact our sales and profitability.\nESG issues, including those related to climate change and sustainability, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations and damage our reputation.\nCompanies across all industries are facing increasing scrutiny relating to their ESG policies. If we are unable to meet our ESG goals or evolving investor, industry or stakeholder expectations and standards, or if we are perceived to have not responded appropriately to the growing concern for ESG issues, customers and consumers may choose to stop purchasing our products or purchase products from another company or a competitor, and our reputation, business or financial condition may be adversely affected. Increased focus and activism on ESG topics may hinder our access to capital, as investors may reconsider their capital investment as a result of their assessment of our ESG practices. In particular, these constituencies are increasingly focusing on environmental issues, including climate change, water use, deforestation, plastic waste, and other sustainability concerns. Changing consumer preferences may result in increased demands regarding plastics and packaging materials, including single-use and non-recyclable plastic packaging, and other components of our products and their environmental impact on sustainability; a growing demand for natural or organic products and ingredients; or increased consumer concerns or perceptions (whether accurate or inaccurate) regarding the effects of ingredients or substances present in certain consumer products. These demands could cause us to incur additional costs or to make changes to our operations to comply with such demands.\nIn addition to environmental issues these constituencies are also focused on social and other governance issues, including matters such as, but not limited to, human capital and social issues. We also have established diversity, equity and inclusion goals as part of our ESG initiative. Our initiatives also extend from individuals to entire communities, including those we serve and, just as importantly, those from which we source.\nConcern over climate change, including plastics and packaging materials, in particular, may result in new or increased legal and regulatory requirements. Increased regulatory requirements related to environmental causes, and related ESG disclosure rules, may result in increased compliance costs or increased costs of energy, raw materials or compliance with emissions standards, which may cause disruptions in the manufacture of our products\n12\nor an increase in operating costs. Any failure to achieve our ESG goals or a perception (whether or not valid) of our failure to act responsibly with respect to the environmental, human capital, or social issues, or to effectively respond to new, or changes in, legal or regulatory requirements concerning environmental or other ESG matters, or increased operating or manufacturing costs due to increased regulation or environmental causes could adversely affect our business and reputation and increase risk of litigation.\nRisks Relating to Credit and Capital Markets, Our Credit Rating, Borrowings and Dividends\nIncreases in interest rates or changes in our credit ratings may negatively impact us.\nOn November 30, 2021, we had total outstanding variable rate debt of approximately $613 million, including $539 million of short-term borrowings, at a weighted-average interest rate of approximately 0.2%. The interest rates under our revolving credit facility can vary based on our credit ratings. Our policy is to manage our interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We also use interest rate swaps to minimize worldwide financing cost and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. We utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including interest rate exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments. Our use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. However, our use of these instruments may not effectively limit or eliminate our exposure to changes in interest rates. Therefore, we cannot provide assurance that future credit rating or interest rate changes will not have a material negative impact on our business, financial position or operating results.\nUncertain global economic conditions expose us to credit risks from customers and counterparties.\nConsolidations in some of the industries in which our customers operate have created larger customers, some of which are highly leveraged. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels through our customer base. These factors have caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Current credit markets are volatile, and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. A significant adverse change in the financial and/or credit position of a customer or counterparty could require us to assume greater credit risk relating to that customer or counterparty and could limit our ability to collect receivables. This could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and liquidity.\nOur credit ratings impact the cost and availability of future borrowings and, accordingly, our cost of capital.\nOur credit ratings reflect each rating organization's opinion of our financial strength, operating performance and ability to meet our debt obligations. Our credit ratings were downgraded following our financing of the acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017 and any reduction in our credit ratings may limit our ability to borrow at interest rates consistent with the interest rates that were available to us prior to that acquisition and the related financing transactions. If our credit ratings are downgraded or put on watch for a potential downgrade, we may not be able to sell additional debt securities or borrow money in the amounts, at the times or interest rates, or upon the more favorable terms and conditions that might be available if our current credit ratings were maintained.\nWe may incur additional indebtedness to finance our acquisitions that may limit our ability to, among other matters, issue additional indebtedness, meet our debt service requirements, react to rising interest rates, comply with certain covenants and compete with less highly leveraged competitors.\nWe have a significant amount of indebtedness outstanding. As of November 30, 2021, the indebtedness of McCormick and its subsidiaries is approximately $5.3 billion. This substantial level of indebtedness could have important consequences to our business, including, but not limited to:\n•\nincreasing our debt service obligations, making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations;\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds;\n•\nincreasing our exposure to negative fluctuations in interest rates;\n•\nsubjecting us to financial and other restrictive covenants, the non-compliance with which could result in an event of default;\n•\nincreasing our vulnerability to, and reducing our flexibility to respond to, general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate; and\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage as compared to our competitors, to the extent that they are not as highly leveraged.\n13\nThe deterioration of credit and capital markets may adversely affect our access to sources of funding.\nWe rely on our revolving credit facility, or borrowings backed by this facility, to fund a portion of our seasonal working capital needs and other general corporate purposes, including funding of acquisitions. If any of the banks in the syndicates backing these facilities were unable to perform on its commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could adversely affect funding of seasonal working capital requirements. We engage in regular communication with all of the banks participating in our revolving credit facility. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions, pricing we receive on services and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe the likelihood of one of our banks not performing on its commitment is remote.\nIn addition, global capital markets have experienced volatility in the past that has tightened access to capital markets and other sources of funding, and such volatility and tightened access could reoccur in the future. In the event that we need to access the capital markets or other sources of financing, there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period. Our inability to obtain financing on acceptable terms or within an acceptable time period could have an adverse impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity.\nThe uncertainty regarding the planned phase-out of LIBOR may negatively impact our operating results.\nLIBOR, the interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, synthetic lease, interest rate swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps is expected to be phased out beginning after December 31, 2021 when private-sector banks are no longer required to report the information used to set the rate. Without this data, LIBOR may no longer be published, or the lack of quality and quantity of data may cause the rate to no longer be representative of the market. On March 5, 2021, the U.K. Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) published a statement confirming that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided or no longer be representative (i) immediately after December 31, 2021, in the case of all sterling, euro, Swiss franc and Japanese yen settings, and the 1-week and 2-month US dollar settings, and (ii) immediately after June 30, 2023, in the case of all remaining US dollar settings. The International Swaps and Derivative Association (ISDA) or Alternative Reference Rates Committee (ARRC) fallback spread adjustments were fixed as of the FCA announcement date and are expected to be implemented at the point each relevant reference rate ceases or becomes non-representative.\nThere continue to be many uncertainties regarding a transition from LIBOR, including but not limited to the need to amend all contracts with LIBOR as the referenced rate and how this will impact the Company’s cost of variable rate debt and certain derivative financial instruments. The Company will also need to consider new contracts and if they should reference an alternative benchmark rate or include suggested fallback language, as published by the ARRC. The consequences of these developments with respect to LIBOR cannot be entirely predicted and span multiple future periods but could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate debt or derivative financial instruments which may be detrimental to our financial position or operating results.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of dividends is made at the discretion of our board of directors and depends on a number of factors.\nThe declaration, payment and amount of any dividends is made pursuant to our dividend policy and is subject to final determination each quarter by our board of directors in its discretion based on a number of factors that it deems relevant, including our financial position, results of operations, available cash resources, cash requirements and alternative uses of cash that our board of directors may conclude would be in the best interest of the company and our shareholders. Our dividend payments are subject to solvency conditions established by the Maryland General Corporation Law. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that any future dividends will be equal or similar in amount to any dividends previously paid or that our board of directors will not decide to reduce, suspend or discontinue the payment of dividends at any time in the future.\nRisks Related to Intellectual Property, Information Technology, and Cyber-Security\nOur intellectual property rights, and those of our customers, could be infringed, challenged or impaired, and reduce the value of our products and brands or our business with customers.\nWe possess intellectual property rights that are important to our business, and we are provided access by certain customers to particular intellectual property rights belonging to such customers.\nThese intellectual property rights include ingredient formulas, trademarks, copyrights, patents, business processes and other trade secrets which are important to our business and relate to some of our products, our packaging, the processes for their production, and\n14\nthe design and operation of equipment used in our businesses. We protect our intellectual property rights, and those of certain customers, globally through a variety of means, including trademarks, copyrights, patents and trade secrets, third-party assignments and nondisclosure agreements, and monitoring of third-party misuses of intellectual property. If we fail to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property (and the intellectual property of customers to which we have been given access), the value of our products and brands could be reduced and there could be an adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur operations and reputation may be impaired if our information technology systems fail to perform adequately or if we are the subject of a data breach or cyber-attack.\nOur information technology systems are critically important to operating our business.  We rely on our information technology systems, some of which are or may be managed or hosted by or out-sourced to third party service providers, to manage our business data, communications, supply chain, order entry and fulfillment, and other business processes.  If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build, sustain, and protect appropriate information technology systems and infrastructure, or we do not effectively implement system upgrades or oversee third party service providers, our business or financial results could be negatively impacted.  The failure of our information technology systems to perform as we anticipate could disrupt our business and could result in transaction or reporting errors, processing inefficiencies and the loss of sales and customers, causing our business and results of operations to suffer.\nFurthermore, our information technology systems, and the systems of our customers, vendors, suppliers, and other third-party service providers, are subject to cyber-attacks or other security incidents including computer viruses or other malicious codes, phishing attacks, ransomware, or other service disruptions, or other system or process failures.\nSuch incidents could result in unauthorized access to information including customer, consumer or other company confidential data as well as disruptions to operations.\nWe, and the third-parties we do business with, have experienced in the past, and expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and attacks, although to date none has been material.\nTo address the risks to our information technology systems and data, we maintain an information security program that includes updating technology, developing security policies and procedures, implementing and assessing the effectiveness of controls, monitoring and routine testing of our information systems, conducting risk assessments of third party service providers and designing business processes to mitigate the risk of such breaches.\nWe believe that these preventative actions provide adequate measures of protection against security breaches and generally reduce our cybersecurity risks. However, cyber-threats are constantly evolving, are becoming more sophisticated and are being made by groups of individuals with a wide range of expertise and motives, which increases the difficulty of detecting and successfully defending against them.\nThere can be no assurance that these measures will prevent or limit the impact of a future incident.\nMoreover, the development and maintenance of these measures requires continuous monitoring as technologies change and efforts to overcome security measures evolve.\nAdditionally, we rely on services provided by third-party vendors for certain information technology processes and functions, which makes our operations vulnerable to a failure by any one of these vendors to perform adequately or maintain effective internal controls.\nIf we are unable to prevent or adequately respond to and resolve an incident, it may have a material, negative impact on our operations or business reputation, and we may experience other adverse consequences such as loss of assets, remediation costs, litigation, regulatory investigations, and the failure by us to retain or attract customers following such an event.\nIf we are not able to successfully implement our business transformation initiative or utilize information technology systems and networks effectively, our ability to conduct our business may be negatively impacted.\nWe continue to implement our multi-year business transformation initiative to execute significant change to our global processes, capabilities and operating model, including in our Global Enablement (GE) organization, in order to provide a scalable platform for future growth, while reducing costs. As technology provides the backbone for greater process alignment, information sharing and scalability, we are also making investments in our information systems, including the multi-year program to replace our enterprise resource planning (ERP) system currently underway, which includes the transformation of our financial processing systems to enterprise-wide systems solutions. These systems implementations are part of our ongoing business transformation initiative, and we plan to implement these systems throughout all parts of our businesses. If we do not allocate and effectively manage the resources necessary to build and sustain the proper information technology infrastructure, or if we fail to achieve the expected benefits from this initiative, it may impact our ability to process transactions accurately and efficiently and remain in step with the changing needs of our business, which could result in the loss of customers and revenue. In\n15\naddition, failure to either deliver the applications on time (due to operational limitations caused by COVID-19 or otherwise), or anticipate the necessary readiness and training needs, could lead to business disruption and loss of customers and revenue. In connection with these implementations and resulting business process changes, we continue to enhance the design and documentation of business processes and controls, including our internal control over financial reporting processes, to maintain effective controls over our financial reporting.\nWe utilize cloud-based services and systems and networks managed by third-party vendors to process, transmit and store information and to conduct certain of our business activities and transactions with employees, customers, vendors and other third parties. Our utilization of these cloud-based services and systems will increase as we implement our business transformation initiatives. If any of these third-party service providers or vendors do not perform effectively, or if we fail to adequately monitor their performance (including compliance with service-level agreements or regulatory or legal requirements), we may not be able to achieve expected cost savings, we may have to incur additional costs to correct errors made by such service providers, our reputation could be harmed or we could be subject to litigation, claims, legal or regulatory proceedings, inquiries or investigations. Depending on the function involved, such errors may also lead to business disruption, processing inefficiencies, the loss of or damage to intellectual property or sensitive data through security breaches or otherwise, incorrect or adverse effects on financial reporting, litigation or remediation costs, or damage to our reputation, which could have a negative impact on employee morale. In addition, the management of multiple third-party service providers increases operational complexity and decreases our control.\nRisks Related to Our Global Business, Litigation, Laws and Regulations\nLaws and regulations could adversely affect our business.\nFood products are extensively regulated in most of the countries in which we sell our products. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to the growing, sourcing, manufacturing, storage, labeling, marketing, advertising and distribution of food products, as well as laws and regulations relating to financial reporting requirements, the environment, consumer protection, competition, anti-corruption, privacy, relations with distributors and retailers, foreign supplier verification, customs and trade laws, including the import and export of products and product ingredients, employment, and health and safety. Enforcement of existing laws and regulations, changes in legal requirements, and/or evolving interpretations of existing regulatory requirements may result in increased compliance costs and create other obligations, financial or otherwise, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results.\nIncreased regulatory scrutiny of, and increased litigation involving, product claims and concerns regarding the attributes of food products and ingredients may increase compliance costs and create other obligations that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or operating results. Governments may also impose requirements and restrictions that impact our business, such as labeling disclosures pertaining to ingredients. For example, \"Proposition 65, the Safe Drinking Water and Toxic Enforcement Act of 1986,\" in California exposes all food companies to the possibility of having to provide warnings on their products in that state. If we were required to add warning labels to any of our products or place warnings in locations where our products are sold in order to comply with Proposition 65, the sales of those products and other products of our company could suffer, not only in those locations but elsewhere.\nIn addition, there are various compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals, including such obligations required by the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into effect in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which came into effect in January 2020. These types of data privacy laws create a range of compliance obligations for companies that process personal data of certain individuals and increases financial penalties for non-compliance. For example, the CCPA imposes requirements on companies that do business in California and collect personal information from customers, including notice, consent and service provider requirements. The CCPA also provides for civil penalties for companies that fail to comply with these requirements, as well as a private right of action for data breaches.  Further, in November 2020, the California Privacy Rights Act (“CPRA”) was passed into law and goes into full effect on January 1, 2023 (with a ‘look-back’ to January 1, 2022). The CPRA builds on the CCPA and among other things, requires the establishment of a dedicated agency to regulate privacy issues. In 2021, Virginia and Colorado adopted laws which will take effect on January 1, 2023, and July 1, 2023, respectively, introducing new privacy obligations, which may require us to develop additional compliance mechanisms and processes. As a company that is subject to data privacy laws, we bear the costs of compliance with them, including the GDPR and U.S. state laws, and are subject to the potential for fines and penalties in the event of a breach of these laws, which continue to evolve. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n16\nLitigation, legal or administrative proceedings could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation.\nWe are party to a variety of legal claims and proceedings in the ordinary course of business. Since litigation is inherently uncertain, there is no guarantee that we will be successful in defending ourselves against such claims or proceedings, or that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of these matters, including any reserves taken in connection with such matters, will be consistent with the ultimate outcome of such claims or proceedings. In the event that management’s assessment of the materiality or immateriality of current claims and proceedings proves inaccurate, or litigation that is material arises in the future, there may be a material adverse effect on our financial condition. Any adverse publicity resulting from allegations made in litigation claims or legal or administrative proceedings (even if untrue) may also adversely affect our reputation. These factors and others could have an adverse impact on our business and financial condition or damage our reputation.\nOur international and cross-border operations are subject to additional risks.\nWe operate our business and market our products internationally. In fiscal year 2021, approximately 40% of our sales were generated in countries other than the U.S. Our international operations are subject to additional risks, including fluctuations in currency values, foreign currency exchange controls, discriminatory fiscal policies, compliance with U.S. and foreign laws, enforcement of remedies in foreign jurisdictions and other economic or political uncertainties. Several countries within the European Union continue to experience sovereign debt and credit issues, which causes more volatility in the economic environment throughout the European Union and the U.K. Additionally, sales in countries other than the U.S., together with finished goods and raw materials imported into the U.S., are subject to risks related to fundamental changes to tax laws as well as the imposition of tariffs, quotas, trade barriers and other similar restrictions. All of these risks could result in increased costs or decreased revenues, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nThe global nature of our business, changes in tax legislation and the resolution of tax uncertainties create volatility in our effective tax rate.\nAs a global business, our tax rate from period to period can be affected by many factors, including changes in tax\nlegislation, our global mix of earnings, the tax characteristics of our income, the timing and recognition of goodwill\nimpairments, acquisitions and dispositions, adjustments to our reserves related to uncertain tax positions, changes in valuation allowances and the portion of the income of international subsidiaries that we expect to remit to the U.S. and that will be taxable.\nIn addition, significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions. We establish accruals for certain tax contingencies when, despite the belief that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, the positions are uncertain. The tax contingency accruals are adjusted in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the progress of tax audits, case law and emerging legislation. Our effective tax rate includes the impact of tax contingency accruals and changes to those accruals, including related interest and penalties, as considered appropriate by management. When particular matters arise, a number of years may elapse before such matters are audited and finally resolved. Favorable resolution of such matters could be recognized as a reduction to our effective tax rate in the year of resolution. Unfavorable resolution of any particular issue could increase the effective tax rate and may require the use of cash in the year of resolution."

    "text": "Overview\nThe following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations (MD&A) is intended to help the reader understand McCormick & Company, Incorporated, our operations and our present business environment from the perspective of management. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto contained in Item 8 of this report. We use certain non-GAAP information — more fully described below under the caption Non-GAAP Financial Measures —  that we believe is important for purposes of comparison to prior periods and development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends. The dollar and share information in the charts and tables in the MD&A are in millions, except per share data. On November 30, 2020, the Company effected a two-for-one stock split in the form of a stock dividend on all shares of the Company’s two classes of common stock. On November 30, 2020, one like share was issued for each share outstanding to shareholders of record as of November 20, 2020.  All common stock and per share data have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the stock split.\nMcCormick is a global leader in flavor. We manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food and beverage industry–retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. We manage our business in two operating segments, consumer and flavor solutions, as described in Item 1 of this report.\nOur long-term annual growth objectives in constant currency are to increase sales 4% to 6%, increase adjusted operating income 7% to 9% and increase adjusted earnings per share 9% to 11%.\nCOVID-19\n– As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, governments around the world either recommended or mandated actions to slow the transmission of the virus that included shelter-in-place orders, quarantines, limitations on crowd size, closures of dine-in restaurants and bars, and significant restrictions on travel, as well as work restrictions that prohibited many employees from going to work. Uncertainty with respect to the economic effects of the pandemic has significantly impacted not only our operating results but also the global economy. The extent and nature of government actions varied during the years ended November 30, 2021 and 2020 based upon the then-current extent and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic within their respective countries and localities.\nWe continue to actively monitor the impact of COVID-19 on all aspects of our business. The effects of COVID-19 on consumer behavior have impacted the relative balance of at-home versus away-from-home food demand. The impact of COVID-19 on our consumer segment since the beginning of the pandemic has resulted in a significant increase in at-home consumption and related demand for our products. In 2021, our flavor solutions segment benefited from a recovery in away-from-home eating that more than offset the net sales declines experienced in 2020 as a result of restrictions imposed to reduce the spread of COVID-19. The COVID-19 mitigation measures in 2020 impacting certain of our flavor solutions customers included the following: (i) with respect to dine-in restaurants, closures, limitations on dine-in capacity, or restrictions on the operations of those restaurants to carry-out or delivery only; and (ii) with respect to quick service restaurants, limitations on operations to drive-through pick-up or delivery. Although certain restrictive measures were reinstated during certain periods of 2021, the prevalence and scale of closures and operating limitations were less severe as compared to 2020. For comparative purposes, the following provides a summary of growth in net sales as reported and on a constant currency basis for the year ended 2021 as compared to 2019:\nThe percentage change in reported net sales and the percentage change on a constant currency basis were\n20\nfavorably impacted by the acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, which, in aggregate, contributed 2.6%, 7.1% and 4.3% to the consumer segment, flavor solutions segment and total net sales growth rates, respectively, in the preceding table, on both a reported and constant currency basis.\nIn early fiscal 2021, vaccines effective in combating COVID-19 were approved by health agencies in certain countries/regions in which we operate (including the U.S., U.K., European Union, Canada and Mexico) and began to be administered. The availability of COVID-19 vaccines and their acceptance by individuals is difficult to predict, and vaccination levels vary across jurisdictions. The pace and shape of the COVID-19 recovery as well as the impact and extent of COVID-19 variants or potential resurgences is not presently known. These and other uncertainties with respect to COVID-19 could result in changes to our current expectations in addition to a number of adverse impacts to our business, including but not limited to additional disruption to the economy and consumers’ willingness and ability to spend, temporary or permanent closures by businesses that consume our products, such as restaurants, additional work restrictions, and supply chains being interrupted, slowed, or rendered inoperable or, in the case of significant increased demand for our product, we may be unable to fulfill that increased demand. As a result, it may be challenging to obtain and process raw materials to support our business needs, and individuals could become ill, quarantined, or otherwise unable to work and/or travel due to health reasons or governmental restrictions. Also, governments may impose other laws, regulations or taxes related to COVID-19 which could adversely impact our business, financial condition, or results of operations. Further, if our customers’ businesses are similarly affected, they might delay or reduce purchases from us. The potential effects of COVID-19 also could impact us in a number of other ways including, but not limited to, variations in the level of our profitability, laws and regulations affecting our business, fluctuations in foreign currency markets, the availability of future borrowings, the cost of borrowings, valuation of our pension assets and obligations, credit risks of our customers and counterparties, and potential impairment of the carrying value of goodwill or other indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nInflationary Cost Environment and Supply Chain Disruption\n– During fiscal 2021, we experienced inflationary cost increases in our commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. We expect that these inflationary cost increases will continue but we expect they will be partially mitigated by pricing actions implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2021, those that we plan to implement in fiscal 2022 and by our Comprehensive Continuous Improvement (CCI) program-led cost savings. During fiscal 2021, we also experienced additional pressure in our supply chain due to strained transportation capacity, as well as due to labor shortages and absenteeism associated with COVID-19, together with the impact of the continued elevated demand. In response to these supply chain pressures, we have taken actions build capacity as well as increase our supply chain related resources. We expect these pressures to continue in 2022.\nSales growth\n:  Over time, we expect to grow sales with similar contributions from: 1) our base business – driven by brand marketing support, category management, and differentiated customer engagement; 2) new products; and 3) acquisitions.\nBase business\n– We expect to drive sales growth by optimizing our brand marketing investment through improved speed, quality and effectiveness. We measure the return on our brand marketing investment and have identified digital marketing as one of our highest return investments in brand marketing support. Through digital marketing, we are connecting with consumers in a personalized way to deliver recipes, provide cooking advice and help them discover new products.\nNew Products\n– For our consumer segment, we believe that scalable and differentiated innovation continues to be one of the best ways to distinguish our brands from our competition, including private label. We are introducing products for every type of cooking occasion, from gourmet, premium items to convenient and value-priced flavors.\nFor flavor solutions customers, we are developing seasonings for snacks and other food products, as well as flavors for new menu items. We have a solid pipeline of flavor solutions products aligned with our customers’ new product launch plans, many of which include clean-label, organic, natural, and “better-for-you” innovation. With over 20 product innovation centers around the world, we are supporting the growth of our brands and those of our flavor solutions customers with products that appeal to local consumers.\nAcquisitions\n– Acquisitions are expected to approximate one-third of our sales growth over time. Since the beginning of 2017, we have completed four acquisitions, which are driving sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. We focus on acquisition opportunities that meet the growing demand for flavor and health. Geographically, our focus is on acquisitions that build scale where we currently have presence in both developed and emerging markets. Information with respect to our three most recent acquisitions is provided below:\n21\n•\nOn December 30, 2020, we acquired FONA International, LLC and certain of its affiliates (FONA), a privately owned company, for approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. We financed this fiscal 2021 acquisition with cash and short-term borrowings. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets which expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories, as well as extends our technology platform, strengthens our capabilities, and accelerates the strategic migration of our portfolio to more value-added and technically insulated products.\n•\nOn November 30, 2020, we acquired the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce® (Cholula) from\nL\nCatterton for approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired. Cholula is a strong addition to McCormick’s global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens the Company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments.\n•\nOn August 17, 2017, we acquired Reckitt Benckiser's Food Division (RB Foods) for approximately $4.2 billion. The acquired iconic brands of RB Foods included French’s®, Frank’s RedHot® and Cattlemen’s®, which are a natural strategic fit with our robust global branded flavor portfolio. We believe that these additions moved us to a leading position in the attractive U.S. condiments category and provide significant international growth opportunities for our consumer and flavor solutions segments.\nThe FONA and Cholula acquisitions contributed approximately one-third of our sales growth in 2021.\nCost savings and business transformation\n: We are fueling our investment in growth with cost savings from our CCI program, an ongoing initiative to improve productivity and reduce costs throughout the organization, that also includes savings from the organization and streamlining actions described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements. In addition to funding brand marketing support, product innovation and other growth initiatives, our CCI program helps offset higher costs and is contributing to higher operating income and earnings per share.\nWe are making investments to build the McCormick of the future, including in our Global Enablement (GE) organization to transform McCormick through globally aligned, innovative services to enable growth. As more fully described in note 3 of notes to our consolidated financial statements, we expect to incur special charges of approximately $60 million to $65 million associated with our GE initiative of which approximately $40.7 million have been recognized through November 30, 2021.  As technology provides the backbone for this greater process alignment, information sharing and scalability, we are also making investments in our information systems.\nFrom late 2018 through early 2020, we progressed in implementing our global enterprise resource planning (ERP) replacement program which will enable us to accelerate the transformation of our ways of working and provide a scalable platform for growth. In the second quarter of fiscal 2020, we elected to pause activity related to our ERP for the balance of fiscal 2020 due, in part, to COVID-19 restrictions that restricted necessary travel by internal and external ERP team members and made it difficult for local McCormick personnel to actively participate in the ERP development, data cleansing, and testing prior to then scheduled pilots later in fiscal 2020. During fiscal 2021, we resumed activities related to our ERP replacement program.\nWe expect that, in total over the course of the ERP replacement program from late 2018 through 2025, we will invest approximately $400 million, including expenses related to the go-live activities in our operations, to enable the anticipated completion of the global roll out of our new information technology platform in 2024. Of that projected $400 million, we expect capitalized software to account for approximately 50% and program expenses to account for approximately 50%. Of the approximately $200 million of operating expenses included in our projected total spending related to our ERP replacement program, approximately $85 million has been recognized through November 30, 2021. Of the approximately $200 million of capitalized software included in our projected total spending related to our ERP program, approximately $115 million has been recognized through November 30, 2021.\nThe GE initiative is expected to generate annual savings, ranging from approximately $45 million to $55 million, once all actions are implemented, including those that are dependent on the replacement of our global ERP platform.\nCash flow\n: We continue to generate strong cash flow. Net cash provided by operating activities was $828.3 million, $1,041.3 million and $946.8 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. In 2021, we continued to have a balanced use of cash for debt repayment, capital expenditures and the return of cash to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. We are using our cash to fund shareholder dividends, with annual increases in each of the past 36 years, and to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions. In 2021, the return of cash to our shareholders through dividends and share repurchases was $371.9 million.\n22\nOperating Results\n: On a long-term basis, we expect a combination of acquisitions, share repurchases and debt repayments, and the resulting impact on interest expense, to add about 2% to earnings per share growth.\nIn 2021, we achieved further growth of our business with net sales rising 12.8% over the 2020 level due to the following factors:\n•\nWe grew volume and product mix, which added 5.5% of sales growth, exclusive of acquisitions. This growth was driven by increases in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. Increased net sales within our consumer segment was driven by strong demand due to a sustained shift in consumer behavior toward at-home meal preparation, which was first seen in 2020 as a response to actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. Increased net sales within our flavor solutions segment was principally driven by sales of away-from-home products as compared to 2020, when actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 significantly impacted demand.\n•\nPricing actions contributed 0.8% of the increase in net sales.\n•\nAcquisitions contributed 4.1% of the increase in net sales.\n•\nNet sales growth was positively impacted by fluctuations in currency rates that increased sales growth by 2.4%. Excluding this impact, we grew sales by 10.4% over the prior year on a constant currency basis.\nOperating income was $1,015.1 million in 2021 and $999.5 million in 2020. We recorded $51.1 million and $6.9 million of special charges in 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to organization and streamlining actions. Special charges in 2021 included $4.7 million in cost of goods sold related the exit of a low margin business. In 2021 and 2020, we also recorded $35.3 million and $12.4 million of transaction and integration expenses, respectively, related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA that reduced operating income. In 2021, compared to the year-ago period, the favorable impact of higher sales, $117.0 million of cost savings from our CCI program, including organization and streamlining actions, and lower incentive-based compensation more than offset the impact of increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, higher conversion costs, which include costs associated with COVID-19, and increased brand marketing costs.  Excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, adjusted operating income was $1,101.5 million in 2021, an increase of 8.1%, compared to $1,018.8 million in the year-ago period. In constant currency, adjusted operating income rose 6.2%. For further details and a reconciliation of non-GAAP to reported amounts, see the subsequent discussion under the heading \"Non-GAAP Financial Measures\".\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.80 in 2021 and $2.78 in 2020. The year-on-year increase in earnings per share was primarily driven by higher operating income. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses lowered earnings per share by $0.30 and $0.05 in 2021 and 2020, respectively. A gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation increased earnings per share by $0.05 in 2021. Excluding the effects of special charges, transaction and integration expenses, and the gain realized from the sale of an unconsolidated operation, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.05 in 2021 and $2.83 in 2020, or an increase of 7.8%.\n2022 Outlook\nIn 2022, we expect to grow net sales over the 2021 level by 3% to 5%, which includes an estimated 1% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or 4% to 6% on a constant currency basis. That anticipated 2022 sales growth includes the impact of pricing actions, including those taken in 2021, to partially offset cost increases.  We expect the impact of pricing to be a significant driver of our sales growth.  We expect volume and product mix to be impacted by pricing elasticities, although at a lower level than we have experienced historically.  We anticipate that our volume and product mix will also be impacted by the exit of a lower margin product line in late 2021.\nWe expect our 2022 gross profit margin to range from an increase of 20 basis points to a decline of 30 basis points from our gross profit margin of 39.5% in 2021. The projected 2022 change in gross profit margin is principally due to the net effect of (i) a mid-teen percentage impact of inflation in 2022 compared to 2021, (ii) the favorable impact of pricing actions in response to increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, (iii) anticipated unfavorable sales mix in 2022 between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2021, (iv) the favorable impact of anticipated CCI cost savings, and (v) the lack of $11.0 million of transaction and integration expenses and special charges reflected in cost of goods sold in 2021. We expect our 2022 gross profit margin, excluding the $11.0 million of transaction and integration expenses and special charges in 2021, to range from comparable to a decline of 50 basis points from our 2021 adjusted gross profit margin of 39.7%.\n23\nIn 2022, we expect an increase in operating income of 13% to 15%, which includes an estimated 1% unfavorable impact from currency rates, over the 2021 level. Our CCI-led cost savings target in 2022 is approximately $85 million. We anticipate integration expenses related to the FONA acquisition of approximately $3 million to favorably impact operating income in 2022, as compared to $35.3 million of transaction and integration expenses in 2021. We also expect approximately $30 million of special charges in 2022 that relate to previously announced organization and streamlining actions; in 2021, special charges were $51.1 million. Excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses, we expect 2022’s adjusted operating income to increase by 7% to 9%, which includes an estimated 1% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or to increase by 8% to 10% on a constant currency basis over the 2021 level.\nOur underlying effective tax rate is projected to be higher in 2022 than in 2021. We estimate that our 2022 effective tax rate, including the net favorable impact of anticipated discrete tax items, will be 22% to 23% as compared to 21.5% in 2021. Excluding projected taxes associated with special charges and transaction and integration expenses, we estimate that our adjusted effective tax rate will be 22% to 23% in 2022, as compared to an adjusted effective tax rate of 20.1% in 2021.\nDiluted earnings per share was $2.80 in 2021. Diluted earnings per share for 2022 is projected to range from $3.07 to $3.12. Excluding the per share impact of i) special charges of $0.16; ii) transaction and integration expenses, including the unfavorable impact of a discrete tax item of $0.04 related to our acquisition of FONA, of $0.14; and iii) the gain realized upon our sale of an unconsolidated operation of $0.05, adjusted diluted earnings per share was $3.05 in 2021. Adjusted diluted earnings per share, excluding an estimated per share impact from special charges of $0.09 and from integration expenses of $0.01, is projected to range from $3.17 to $3.22 in 2022. We expect adjusted diluted earnings per share to grow by 4% to 6%, which includes a 1% unfavorable impact from currency rates, or to grow by 5% to 7% on a constant currency basis over adjusted diluted earnings per share of $3.05 in 2021.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2021 COMPARED TO 2020\nSales for 2021 increased by 12.8% from 2020 and by 10.4% on a constant currency basis. That 12.8% sales increase was driven by higher sales in both our consumer and flavor solutions segments. On a consolidated basis, higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 5.5% while pricing actions, which were primarily taken in the fourth quarter, added 0.8% to sales. That net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by continued levels of strong demand within our consumer segment, as the shift in consumer behavior toward at-home meal preparation, first seen in 2020 as a response to actions taken to mitigate the spread of COVID-19, has persisted. In addition, our flavor solutions segment volume increased principally due to a recovery in demand for away-from-home products, including higher sales to our branded food service customers, as compared to 2020. Sales were also impacted by favorable foreign currency rates that increased net sales 2.4% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.4% on a constant currency basis.\nIn 2021, our gross profit margin decreased 160 basis points to 39.5% from 41.1% in 2020. The decline was driven by the impact of increased commodity, packaging materials and transportation costs, higher conversion costs, which includes costs associated with COVID-19, and a less favorable mix in sales between our consumer and flavor solutions segments as compared to 2020. These unfavorable impacts were partially offset by savings from our CCI program, pricing actions, improved product mix and the accretive impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions, each as compared to the prior year period. In addition, our 2021 gross profit margin was burdened by (i) $6.3 million of transaction expense, representing the amortization of the fair value adjustment to the acquired inventories of Cholula and FONA upon our sale of those acquired inventories, and (ii) a non-cash special charge of $4.7 million\n24\nassociated with the exit of a low margin business in our Asia/Pacific region. Excluding the transaction expense and special charges, adjusted gross profit margin decreased by 140 basis points from 41.1% in 2020 to 39.7% for the year ended November 30, 2021.\nSelling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense was $1,404.1 million in 2021 compared to $1,281.6 million in 2020, an increase of $122.5 million. That increase in SG&A expense was primarily a result of (i) SG&A associated with the Cholula and FONA acquisitions; (ii) greater selling and distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume; and (iii) increased brand marketing costs, all as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. Those increases were partially offset by lower performance-based employee incentive expenses, as compared to the prior year period. SG&A as a percent of net sales for 2021 decreased by 60 basis points from the prior year level, driven by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2021 period.\nWe regularly evaluate whether to implement changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness, and we expect to continue to evaluate such actions in the future. From time to time, those changes are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/ structural impact that we obtain advance approval from our Management Committee and classify expenses related to those changes as special charges in our financial statements.\nDuring 2021, we recorded $51.1 million of special charges, consisting principally of (i) $19.5 million associated with our exit of our rice product line in India, as more fully described below, (ii) $6.2 million associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, (iii) streamlining actions of $10.3 million in the Americas region and $4.8 million in the EMEA region, and (iv) a non-cash asset impairment charge of $6.0 million associated with an administrative site that was sold in conjunction with our decision to employ a hybrid work environment.\nAs more fully described in note 3 of our notes of consolidated financial statements, the $19.5 million special charge associated with the exit of our rice product line in India consisted of an $11.2 million non-cash impairment charge associated with the impairment of certain intangible assets, $3.6 million of employee severance and other related exit costs, and a $4.7 million charge in cost of goods sold which represents a provision for the excess of the carrying value of rice inventories over the estimated net realizable value and a contractual obligation associated with terminating a rice supply agreement.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $6.9 million of special charges, consisting of $5.3 million related to streamlining actions in our EMEA region and $1.6 million related to our GE initiative.\nDuring 2021, we recorded transaction and integration expenses of $35.3 million related to our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA. These costs consisted of (i) $6.3 million of amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in Cost of goods sold, (ii) $13.8 million of other transaction expenses primarily related to outside advisory, service and consulting costs, and (iii) $15.2 million of integration expenses. Transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of Cholula and\nFONA of $11.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, were incurred late in fiscal 2020.\n25\nOperating income increased by $15.6 million, or 1.6%, from $999.5 million in 2020 to $1,015.1 million in 2021. Special charges and transaction and integration expenses increased by $67.1 million in 2021, as compared to 2020, and negatively impacted operating income. Operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 170 basis points in 2021, to 16.1% in 2021 from 17.8% in 2020 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described, adjusted operating income was $1,101.5 million in 2021 as compared to $1,018.8 million in 2020, an increase of $82.7 million or 8.1% over the 2020 level. Adjusted operating income as a percentage of net sales declined by 80 basis points in 2021, to 17.4% in 2021 from 18.2% in 2020.\nInterest expense was $1.0 million higher for 2021 as compared to the prior year as an increase in average total borrowings was largely offset by a decrease in interest rates. Other income, net for 2021 decreased by $0.3 million as lower non-service cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans was partially offset by higher interest income, as compared to 2020. The decrease was also impacted by non-operating foreign currency transaction gains in 2021, as compared to non-operating foreign currency transaction losses in the prior period.\nThe provision for income taxes is based on the estimate of the annual effective tax rate adjusted to reflect the tax impact of items discrete to the fiscal period. We record tax expense or tax benefits that do not relate to ordinary income in the current fiscal year discretely in the period in which such items occur pursuant to the requirements of U.S. GAAP. Examples of such types of discrete items not related to ordinary income include, but are not limited to, excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees, changes in estimates of the outcome of tax matters related to prior years, including reversals of reserves upon the lapsing of statutes of limitations, provision-to-return adjustments, the settlement of tax audits, changes in enacted tax rates, changes in the assessment of deferred tax valuation allowances and the tax effects of certain intra-entity asset transfers (other than inventory).\nThe effective tax rate was 21.5% in 2021 as compared to 19.8% in 2020. The increase in our effective tax rate was principally attributable to the lower level of net discrete tax benefits in 2021 as compared to 2020.  Net discrete tax benefits were $26.6 million in 2021, a decrease of $16.8 million from $43.4 million in 2020. Discrete tax benefits in both the 2021 and 2020 periods included excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees ($4.3 million and $14.2 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively), the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits ($22.5 million and $4.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) due to, in 2021, the partial release of certain reserves for an unrecognized tax benefit and related interest in a non-U.S. jurisdiction based on a change in our assessment of the technical merits of that position associated with the availability of new information, and in both years due to the expiration of the statues of limitations, the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets ($4.4 million and $11.9 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively) and other discrete items. In 2021, discrete tax items included $4.0 million of tax benefits related to the revaluation of deferred taxes resulting from enacted legislation and $10.4 million of deferred state tax expense directly related to our December 2020 acquisition of FONA. In 2020, discrete tax items included $9.9 million of tax benefits associated with intra-entity asset transfers that occurred.  See note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.\nIncome from unconsolidated operations, which is presented net of the elimination of earnings attributable to non-controlling interests, increased $11.4 million in 2021 from the prior year, driven by an after-tax gain of $13.4 million on the sale of our 26% interest in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd. (Eastern), an unconsolidated operation, during our second quarter of 2021, as more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including our largest joint venture,\n26\nMcCormick de Mexico, that comprised 62% and 75% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The relative impact of McCormick de Mexico on income from unconsolidated operations in 2021 was impacted by the gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation.\nWe reported diluted earnings per share of $2.80 in 2021, compared to $2.78 in 2020. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2020 to 2021. The increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from favorable currency exchange rates in 2021.\nResults of Operations—Segments\nWe measure the performance of our business segments based on operating income, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions. See note 16 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information on our segment measures as well as for a reconciliation by segment of operating income, excluding special charges and transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions. In the following discussion, we refer to our previously described measure of segment profit as \"Segment operating income\".\nConsumer Segment\nSales of our consumer segment in 2021 grew by 9.5% as compared to 2020 and grew by 7.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase included higher sales of our consumer business in each of our three regions. Higher volume and product mix increased sales 4.3% while pricing actions added 0.6% to sales, both as compared to the prior year period. The incremental impact of the Cholula acquisition added 2.4% to segment sales during 2021. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased consumer segment sales by 2.2% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 7.3% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Americas region, consumer sales increased 7.3% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a 13.9% increase in sales from the 2019 level as a result of exceptionally strong demand for our products in the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, and increased by 6.7% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 3.0% as compared to the corresponding period in 2020, as demand continues to be driven by consumers' sustained preference for eating more at home. In addition, pricing actions, taken in response to higher costs, increased sales by 0.4% as compared to the prior year period. The incremental impact of the Cholula acquisition added 3.3% to sales in 2021. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.6% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 6.7% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the EMEA region, consumer sales increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a 14.5% increase in sales from the 2019 level driven by the COVID-19 impact on greater consumer at-home meal\n27\npreparation, and increased by 0.9% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 0.3% as compared to the corresponding period of 2020. The impact of pricing actions increased sales by 0.6% as compared to the prior year period. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 4.9% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 0.9% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales increased 31.6% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which reflected a 16.6% decrease in sales from the 2019 level due mainly to COVID-19 disruption on foodservice sales in China, and increased by 22.9% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 21.5% as compared to the corresponding period in 2020. The increase was driven by sales related to the recovery of demand in away-from-home consumption in China. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.4% as compared to 2020. The favorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 8.7% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 22.9% on a constant currency basis.\nSegment operating income for our consumer segment increased by $24.0 million, or 3.1%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in segment operating income was driven by higher sales, including the impact of acquisitions, CCI-led cost savings and lower incentive-based compensation accruals which were partially offset by increased commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs, increased conversion costs, which include incremental expenses related to COVID-19, and higher brand marketing investment, all as compared to the prior year period. The impact of COVID-19 on segment operating income during 2021 reflected actions, including the incremental impact of temporary arrangements to utilize co-manufacturing, that increased our cost to produce certain products and measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning that reduced productivity. Segment operating margin for our consumer segment decreased by 130 basis points in 2021 to 20.4%, driven by a decrease in segment gross profit margin, including the impact of the inflationary cost environment, which was partially offset by the benefit from the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher sales base as compared to the 2020 level. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our consumer segment increased by 1.3% in 2021, as compared to 2020.\nFlavor Solutions Segment\nSales of our flavor solutions segment increased 18.7% in 2021 as compared to 2020 and increased by 15.9% on a constant currency basis. Sales were favorably impacted by the recovery of demand as compared to the lower level of demand in 2020 due to the impact of the COVID-19 disruption on our quick service restaurant and branded food service customers, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. Favorable volume and product mix increased segment sales by 7.2% as compared to 2020, while pricing actions taken in response to increased costs during the period increased sales by 1.4%. The incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions increased sales by 7.3% in 2021. The favorable impact of foreign currency rates increased flavor solutions segment sales by 2.8% as compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 15.9% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Americas region, flavor solutions sales increased by 16.6% during 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a sales decline of 3.5% from the 2019 level driven by lower sales to quick service restaurant and branded food service customers as a result of COVID-19 restrictions imposed in the early stages of the pandemic, and increased by 15.4% on a constant currency basis.  Favorable volume and improved product mix increased flavor solutions sales in the Americas by 3.2% during 2021, driven primarily by increased sales to branded foodservice and quick service restaurant customers. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.7% as compared to the prior year period. The incremental impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions increased sales by 10.5% in 2021. A favorable impact from foreign currency rates increased sales by 1.2% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 15.4% on a constant currency basis.\n28\nIn the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales in 2021 increased by 27.3% as compared to 2020, which experienced a sales decline of 5.5% from the 2019 level primarily as a result of decreased sales to quick service restaurants and lower branded food service sales that were partially offset by higher demand from packaged food service companies in response to COVID-19 restrictions implemented in 2020, and increased by 21.5% on a constant currency basis.  Favorable volume and product mix increased segment sales by 19.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase was primarily attributable to higher sales to branded foodservice, packaged food and quick service restaurant customers. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.7% in 2021 as compared the prior year level. A favorable impact from foreign currency rates increased sales by 5.8% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 21.5% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, flavor solutions sales increased 16.9% in 2021 as compared to 2020, which experienced a sales increase of 0.4% from the 2019 level driven by higher sales to quick service restaurant customers, and increased by 9.4% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 10.6%, driven by higher sales to quick service restaurant customers. Pricing actions decreased sales by 1.2% as compared to the prior year period. A favorable impact from foreign currency rates increased sales by 7.5% compared to 2020 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 9.4% on a constant currency basis.\nSegment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by $58.7 million, or 24.7%, in 2021 as compared to 2020. The increase in segment operating income was driven by higher sales, including the impact of acquisitions, CCI-led cost savings, lower incentive-based compensation accruals and favorable product mix, which was partially offset by increased commodities, packaging materials and transportation costs. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment increased by 60 basis points in 2021 to 12.5% as the benefits from the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher sales base as compared to the 2020 level, together with the accretive impact of the Cholula and FONA acquisitions on gross margins, were partially offset by the impact of the inflationary cost environment as compared to 2020. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment increased by 22.5% in 2021, as compared to 2020.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS—2020 COMPARED TO 2019\nSales for 2020 increased by 4.7% from 2019 and by 5.3% on a constant currency basis. That 4.7% sales increase was driven by higher sales in our consumer segment, which increased by 10.0% over the 2019 level, partially offset by lower sales in our flavor solutions segment, which declined by 3.5% from the prior year level. On a consolidated basis, higher volume and favorable product mix increased sales by 3.7% while pricing actions added 1.6% to sales. That net volume increase and favorable mix was driven by higher demand within our consumer segment, as measures imposed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 and the related change in consumer behavior, resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward at-home meal preparation that more than offset lower demand within our flavor solutions segment principally associated with our restaurant and branded food service customers. Sales were also impacted by unfavorable foreign currency rates that decreased net sales 0.6% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 5.3% on a constant currency basis.\nIn 2020, our gross profit margin increased 100 basis points to 41.1% from 40.1% in 2019. This improvement was driven by the favorable impact of CCI-led cost savings, favorable pricing actions and the mix of consumer and flavor solutions sales, partially offset by unfavorable conversion costs and increased material costs. Higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with COVID-19, including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees, measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity, and the impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories.\n29\nSG&A expense was $1,281.6 million in 2020 compared to $1,166.8 million in 2019, an increase of $114.8 million. That increase in SG&A expense was primarily a result of (i) higher performance-based employee incentive expense accruals, (ii) higher distribution expenses associated with the higher sales volume, (iii) increased brand marketing costs and (iv) a one-time fiscal 2019 expense reduction from the alignment of an employee benefit plan to our global standard that did not recur in 2020, all as compared to 2019. SG&A expense as a percent of net sales increased by 110 basis points from the prior year level, primarily as a result of the previously mentioned factors, partially offset by the impact of the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher level of sales during the 2020 period.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $6.9 million of special charges, consisting of $5.3 million related to streamlining actions in our EMEA region and $1.6 million related to our GE initiative.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $20.8 million of special charges, consisting primarily of (i) $14.1 million of costs related to our multi-year GE business transformation initiative, including $10.6 million of third-party expenses, $2.1 million related to severance and related benefits, and $1.4 million related to other costs; (ii) $2.3 million of severance and related benefits associated with streamlining actions in the Americas; and (iii) $3.9 million related to streamlining actions in our EMEA region.\nTransaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions of Cholula and\nFONA of $11.2 million and $1.2 million, respectively, were incurred late in fiscal 2020.\nOperating income increased by $41.8 million, or 4.4%, from $957.7 million in 2019 to $999.5 million in 2020. Operating income as a percent of net sales declined by 10 basis points in 2020, to 17.8% in 2020 from 17.9% in 2019 as a result of the factors previously described. Excluding the effect of special charges and transaction and integration expenses previously described, adjusted operating income was $1,018.8 million in 2020 as compared to $978.5 million in 2019, an increase of $40.3 million or 4.1% over the 2019 level. Adjusted operating income as a percent of net sales declined by 10 basis points in 2020, to 18.2% in 2020 from 18.3% in 2019.\nInterest expense was $29.6 million lower for 2020 as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decline in average total borrowings and a lower interest rate environment. Other income, net for 2020 decreased by $9.1 million from the 2019 level due principally to lower non-service cost income associated with our pension and postretirement benefit plans that declined by $7.6 million in 2020 from the prior year level.\nThe effective tax rate was 19.8% in 2020 as compared to 19.2% in 2019. The effective tax rate of 19.2% in 2019 includes a non-recurring net tax benefit of $1.5 million associated with the U.S. Tax Act. Net discrete tax benefits were $43.4 million in 2020, which is a decrease of $0.3 million from $43.7 million in 2019, including the $1.5 million\n30\nnon-recurring benefit of the U.S. Tax Act in 2019. Discrete tax benefits in both the 2020 and 2019 periods include excess tax benefits associated with share-based payments to employees ($14.2 million and $22.4 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively), the tax benefits associated with intra-entity asset transfers that occurred ($9.9 million and $15.2 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively), the reversal of reserves for unrecognized tax benefits for the expiration of the statues of limitations and other discrete items. In 2020, discrete tax benefits included $11.9 million associated with the release of valuation allowances due to a change in judgment about realizability of deferred tax assets. See note 13 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed reconciliation of the U.S. federal tax rate with the effective tax rate.\nIncome from unconsolidated operations decreased $0.1 million in 2020 from the prior year. We own 50% of most of our unconsolidated joint ventures, including our largest joint venture, McCormick de Mexico, that comprised 75% and 72% of the income of our unconsolidated operations in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe reported diluted earnings per share of $2.78 in 2020, compared to $2.62 in 2019. The table below outlines the major components of the change in diluted earnings per share from 2019 to 2020. The increase in adjusted operating income in the table below includes the impact from unfavorable currency exchange rates in 2020.\nResults of Operations—Segments\nConsumer Segment\nSales of our consumer segment in 2020 grew by 10.0% as compared to 2019 and grew by 10.3% on a constant currency basis. This increase was driven by sharply higher sales of our consumer business in the Americas and in EMEA, with a partial offset from a sales decline in the Asia/Pacific region. Asia/Pacific region sales declines were driven by lower sales in China, which includes the impact of away-from-home products included in its consumer portfolio. Higher volume and product mix added 8.8% to sales as measures imposed to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 resulted in a shift in consumer behavior toward at-home meal preparation. Pricing actions added 1.5% to sales as compared to the prior year period. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased consumer segment sales by 0.3% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 10.3% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Americas, consumer sales rose 13.9% in 2020 as compared to 2019 and rose by 14.0% on a constant currency basis. Higher volume and product mix added 11.9% to sales driven by significant growth across the McCormick branded portfolio. In addition, pricing actions, taken in response to higher costs, increased sales by 2.1% as compared to the prior year period. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates decreased\n31\nsales by 0.1% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 14.0% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the EMEA region, consumer sales increased 14.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019 and rose by 14.3% on a constant currency basis. Volume and product mix increased sales by 13.9%. The increase was broad based across the region with particular strength in branded spices and seasonings and homemade dessert products in France. The impact of pricing actions increased sales by 0.4%. The favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rates increased sales by 0.2% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 14.3% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, consumer sales decreased 16.6% as compared to 2019 and decreased 15.1% on a constant currency basis. Lower volume and product mix reduced sales by 15.0%. The decrease was driven by products related to away-from-home consumption in China. Partially offsetting this decline was growth in cooking-at-home products, particularly in Australia. Pricing actions reduced sales by 0.1% as compared to 2019. The unfavorable impact from foreign currency exchange rates decreased sales by 1.5% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 15.1% on a constant currency basis.\nWe grew segment operating income for our consumer segment by $104.6 million, or 15.5%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The increase in segment operating income was driven by the impact of higher sales, as previously described, and CCI-led cost savings, partially offset by higher conversion costs, increased material costs, increased brand marketing costs and higher performance-based employee incentive expense accruals. Higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with COVID-19, including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees as well as measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity. Segment operating margin for our consumer segment rose by 100 basis points in 2020 to 21.7%, driven by an increase in consumer gross profit margin that was partially offset by an increase in SG&A expense as a percentage of net sales as compared to the 2019 period. Segment operating margin in 2020 benefited from the leverage of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a higher sales base than compared to the 2019 level. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our consumer segment rose by 15.7% in 2020 in comparison to the same period in 2019.\nFlavor Solutions Segment\nSales of our flavor solutions segment decreased 3.5% in 2020 as compared to 2019 and decreased by 2.4% on a constant currency basis. Driving that decrease in sales was lower demand due to the impact of the COVID-19 disruption on our restaurant and branded food service customers, particularly in the Americas and EMEA regions. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales by 4.2% as compared to 2019, while pricing actions, taken in response to increased costs, during the period increased sales by 1.8%. The unfavorable impact of foreign currency rates decreased flavor solutions segment sales by 1.1% as compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 2.4% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Americas, flavor solutions sales decreased by 3.5% in 2020 as compared to the prior year level and decreased by 2.5% on a constant currency basis. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased flavor solutions sales in the Americas by 4.4% during 2020, driven by lower sales to branded foodservice and quick service restaurant customers, but was partially offset by higher sales to packaged food companies. Pricing actions increased sales by 1.9% as compared to the prior year period. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 1.0% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 2.5% on a constant currency basis.\n32\nIn the EMEA region, flavor solutions sales in 2020 decreased by 5.5% from the prior year level and decreased by 4.2% on a constant currency basis. Unfavorable volume and product mix decreased segment sales by 7.0% as compared to 2019. The decline was primarily attributable to lower sales to branded foodservice and quick service restaurant customers, partially offset by higher demand from packaged food companies. Pricing actions increased sales by 2.8% in 2020 as compared the prior year level. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 1.3% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales decline of 4.2% on a constant currency basis.\nIn the Asia/Pacific region, flavor solutions sales increased 0.4% in 2020 from the prior year level and increased by 1.6% on a constant currency basis. Favorable volume and product mix increased sales by 2.2%, driven by higher sales to quick service restaurant customers. Pricing actions decreased sales by 0.6% as compared to the prior year period. An unfavorable impact from foreign currency rates decreased sales by 1.2% compared to 2019 and is excluded from our measure of sales growth of 1.6% on a constant currency basis.\nSegment operating income for our flavor solutions segment decreased by $64.3 million, or 21.3%, in 2020 as compared to 2019. The decrease in segment operating income was driven by lower sales, increased conversion costs, the impact of lower production volumes, increased material costs and higher performance-based employee incentive expense accruals that were partially offset by CCI-led cost savings. Higher conversion costs during 2020 reflected certain matters associated with COVID-19, including the impact of temporary arrangements that increased salaries and benefits paid to our manufacturing employees as well as measures to enable manufacturing and distribution staff to maintain social distancing and permit enhanced cleaning between shifts that reduced productivity, and the impact of lower production volumes of flavor solutions inventories. Segment operating margin for our flavor solutions segment decreased by 260 basis points from the prior year level to 11.9% in 2020, driven by lower flavor solutions segment gross profit margin and an increase in SG&A expense as a percent of net sales. Segment operating margin in 2020 also declined due to the deleveraging impact of fixed and semi-fixed expenses over a lower sales base as compared to the 2019 period. On a constant currency basis, segment operating income for our flavor solutions segment declined by 19.7% in 2020, as compared to the same period in 2019.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nThe following tables include financial measures of adjusted gross profit, adjusted gross profit margin, adjusted operating income, adjusted operating income margin, adjusted income tax expense, adjusted income tax rate, adjusted net income and adjusted diluted earnings per share. These represent non-GAAP financial measures which are prepared as a complement to our financial results prepared in accordance with United States generally accepted accounting principles. These financial measures exclude the impact, as applicable, of the following:\n•\nSpecial charges – Special charges consist of expenses associated with certain actions undertaken by the Company to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (including details with respect to estimated costs, which generally consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee’s advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an ongoing basis through completion.\n•\nTransaction and integration expenses associated with the Cholula and FONA acquisitions – We exclude certain costs associated with our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA in November and December 2020, respectively, and their subsequent integration into the Company. Such costs, which we refer to as “Transaction and integration expenses”, include transaction costs associated with each acquisition, as well as integration costs following the respective acquisition, including the impact of the acquisition date fair value adjustment for inventory, together with the impact of discrete tax items, if any, directly related to each acquisition.\n•\nIncome from sale of unconsolidated operations\n–\nWe exclude the gain realized upon our sale of an unconsolidated operation in March 2021. As more fully described in note 5 of the notes to the accompanying financial statements, the sale of our 26% interest in Eastern resulted in a gain of $13.4\n33\nmillion, net of tax of $5.7 million. The gain is included in Income from unconsolidated operations in our consolidated income statement.\n•\nIncome taxes associated with the U.S. Tax Act – We recorded a net income tax benefit of $1.5 million during the year ended November 30, 2019 associated with the U.S. Tax Act enacted in December 2017 related provision to return adjustment.\nDetails with respect to the composition of transaction and integration expenses, special charges and income from the sale of unconsolidated operations recorded for the years and in the amounts set forth below are included in notes 2, 3 and 5, respectively, of notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP financial measures are important. The exclusion of the items noted above provides additional information that enables enhanced comparisons to prior periods and, accordingly, facilitates the development of future projections and earnings growth prospects. This information is also used by management to measure the profitability of our ongoing operations and analyze our business performance and trends.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures may be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP, but they should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, GAAP results.  In addition, these non-GAAP financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies because other companies may not calculate them in the same manner that we do. We intend to continue to provide these non-GAAP financial measures as part of our future earnings discussions and, therefore, the inclusion of these non-GAAP financial measures will provide consistency in our financial reporting.\n34\nA reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial results is provided below:\n35\nBecause we are a multi-national company, we are subject to variability of our reported U.S. dollar results due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. Those changes have been volatile over the past several years. The exclusion of the effects of foreign currency exchange, or what we refer to as amounts expressed “on a constant currency basis,” is a non-GAAP measure. We believe that this non-GAAP measure provides additional information that enables enhanced comparison to prior periods excluding the translation effects of changes in rates of foreign currency exchange and provides additional insight into the underlying performance of our operations located outside of the U.S. It should be noted that our presentation herein of amounts and percentage changes on a constant currency basis does not exclude the impact of foreign currency transaction gains and losses (that is, the impact of transactions denominated in other than the local currency of any of our subsidiaries in their local currency reported results).\nPercentage changes in sales and adjusted operating income expressed on a constant currency basis are presented excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange. To present this information for historical periods, current year results for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at the average exchange rates in effect during the prior fiscal year, rather than at the actual average exchange rates in effect during the current fiscal year. As a result, the foreign currency impact is equal to the current year results in local currencies multiplied by the change in the average foreign currency exchange rate between the current year and the prior fiscal year. The tables set forth below present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income on a constant currency basis as follows: (1) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2021 on a constant currency basis, net sales and adjusted operating income for 2021 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2020 and compared to the reported results for 2020; and (2) to present our growth in net sales and adjusted operating income for 2020 on a constant currency basis, net sales and operating income for 2020 for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar have been translated using the average foreign exchange rates in effect for 2019 and compared to the reported results for 2019.\n36\nTo present the percentage change in projected 2022 net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share — diluted on a constant currency basis, 2022 projected local currency net sales, adjusted operating income, and adjusted net income for entities reporting in currencies other than the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars at currently prevailing exchange rates and are compared to those 2022 local currency projected results, translated into U.S. dollars at the average actual exchange rates in effect during the corresponding months in fiscal year 2021 to determine what the 2022 consolidated U.S. dollar net sales, adjusted operating income and adjusted earnings per share — diluted would have been if the relevant currency exchange rates had not changed from those of the comparable 2021 periods.\n37\nLIQUIDITY AND FINANCIAL CONDITION\nThe primary objective of our financing strategy is to maintain a prudent capital structure that provides us flexibility to pursue our growth objectives. We use a combination of equity and short- and long-term debt. We use short-term debt, comprised primarily of commercial paper, principally to finance ongoing operations, including our requirements for working capital (accounts receivable, prepaid expenses and other current assets, and inventories, less accounts payable, accrued payroll, and other accrued liabilities). We are committed to maintaining investment grade credit ratings.\nOur cash flows from operations enable us to fund operating projects and investments that are designed to meet our growth objectives, service our debt, fund or increase our quarterly dividends, fund capital projects and other investments, and make share repurchases when appropriate. Due to the cyclical nature of a portion of our business, our cash flow from operations has historically been the strongest during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year. Due to the timing of the interest payments on our debt, interest payments are higher in the first and third quarter of our fiscal year.\nWe believe that our sources of liquidity, which include existing cash balances, cash flows from operations, existing credit facilities, our commercial paper program, and access to capital markets, will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our debt obligations, including any repayment of debt or refinancing of debt, working capital needs, planned capital expenditures, and payment of anticipated quarterly dividends for at least the next twelve months.\nIn the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, as these do not reflect actual cash flows. In addition, in the cash flow statement, the changes in operating assets and liabilities are presented excluding the effect of acquired operating assets and liabilities, as the cash flows associated with acquisition of businesses is presented as an investing activity. Accordingly, the amounts in the cash flow statement do not agree with changes in the operating assets and liabilities that are presented in the balance sheet.\nThe reported values of our assets and liabilities held in our non-U.S. subsidiaries and affiliates can be significantly affected by fluctuations in foreign exchange rates between periods. At November 30, 2021, the exchange rates for the Canadian dollar and Chinese renminbi were higher versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2020. At November 30, 2021, the exchange rates for the Euro, British pound sterling, Australian dollar, and Polish zloty were lower versus the U.S. dollar than at November 30, 2020.\nOperating Cash Flow\n–\nOperating cash flow was $828.3 million in 2021, $1,041.3 million in 2020, and $946.8 million in 2019. Net income as well as our working capital management, as more fully described below, impacted operating cash flow. In 2021, the reduction in operating cash flow was the result of increased inventory levels to protect against supply disruption, employee incentive payments, and the payment of transaction and integration costs related to our recent acquisitions. In 2020, the increases to operating cash flow were the result of a significantly lower use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities, including the timing of certain employee incentive and customer related payments, which was partially offset by the use of cash associated with working capital, driven by the increased level of inventory to meet demand. In 2019, our working capital management favorably impacted operating cash flow. In 2019, those increases were partially offset by a use of cash associated with other assets and liabilities, totaling $81.5 million.\nOur working capital management\n–\nprincipally related to inventory, trade accounts receivable, and accounts payable\n–\nimpacts our operating cash flow. The change in inventory had a significant impact on the variability in cash flow from operations. It was a significant use of cash in 2021 and 2020 and a moderate use of cash in 2019. The change in trade accounts receivable was a use of cash in 2021 but a source of cash in 2020 and 2019. The change in accounts payable was a significant source of cash in 2020 and 2019 and a more moderate source of cash in 2021.\nIn addition to operating cash flow, we also use cash conversion cycle (CCC) to measure our working capital management. This metric is different than operating cash flow in that it uses average balances instead of specific point in time measures. CCC is a calculation of the number of days, on average, that it takes us to convert a cash outlay for resources, such as raw materials, to a cash inflow from collection of accounts receivable. Our goal is to lower our CCC over time. We calculate CCC as follows:\n38\nDays sales outstanding (average trade accounts receivable divided by average daily net sales) plus days in inventory (average inventory divided by average daily cost of goods sold) less days payable outstanding (average trade accounts payable divided by average daily cost of goods sold plus the average daily change in inventory).\nThe following table outlines our cash conversion cycle (in days) over the last three years:\nThe increase in CCC in 2021 from 2020 was due primarily to an increase in our days in inventory as a result of efforts to protect against supply chain disruption and to meet increased demand. This was partially offset by an increase in our days payable outstanding. The decrease in CCC in 2020 from 2019 was due to an increase in our days payable outstanding as a result of extending our payment terms to suppliers, as more fully described below, which was partially offset by an increase in our days in inventory due to maintaining higher levels of inventory.\nPrior to fiscal 2019, in response to evolving market practices, we began a program to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. We also initiated a Supply Chain Finance program (SCF) with several global financial institutions (SCF Banks). Under the SCF, qualifying suppliers may elect to sell their receivables from us to an SCF Bank. These participating suppliers negotiate their receivables sales arrangements directly with the respective SCF Bank. While we are not party to those agreements, the SCF Banks allow the participating suppliers to utilize our creditworthiness in establishing credit spreads and associated costs. This generally provides the suppliers with more favorable terms than they would be able to secure on their own. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to sell a receivable. Once a qualifying supplier elects to participate in the SCF and reaches an agreement with a SCF Bank, the supplier elects which of our individual invoices they sell to the SCF bank. However, all of our payments to participating suppliers are paid to the SCF Bank on the invoice due date, regardless of whether the individual invoice is sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank. The SCF Bank pays the supplier on the invoice due date for any invoices that were not previously sold by the supplier to the SCF Bank.\nThe terms of our payment obligation are not impacted by a supplier’s participation in the SCF. Our payment terms with our suppliers for similar materials within individual markets are consistent between those suppliers that elect to participate in the SCF and those suppliers that do not participate. Accordingly, our average days outstanding are not significantly impacted by the portion of suppliers or related input costs that are included in the SCF. For our participating suppliers, we believe substantially all of their receivables with us are sold to the SCF Banks. Accordingly, we would expect that at each balance sheet date, a similar proportion of amounts originally due to suppliers would instead be payable to SCF Banks. All outstanding amounts related to suppliers participating in the SCF are recorded within the line entitled \"Trade accounts payable\" in our consolidated balance sheets, and the associated payments are included in operating activities within our consolidated statements of cash flows. As of November 30, 2021 and 2020, the amount due to suppliers participating in the SCF and included in \"Trade accounts payable\" were approximately $274.3 million and $273.6 million, respectively.\nFuture changes in our suppliers’ financing policies or economic developments, such as changes in interest rates, general market liquidity or our creditworthiness relative to participating suppliers could impact those suppliers’ participation in the SCF and/or our ability to negotiate extended payment terms with our suppliers. However, any such impacts are difficult to predict.\nInvesting Cash Flow\n–\nNet cash used in investing activities was $908.6 million in 2021, $1,025.6 million in 2020, and $171.0 million in 2019. Our primary investing cash flows include the usage of cash associated with acquisition of businesses and capital expenditures. Cash usage related to our acquisition of businesses was $706.4 million in 2021 and $803.0 million in 2020. Capital expenditures, including expenditures for capitalized software, were $278.0 million in 2021, $225.3 million in 2020, and $173.7 million in 2019. We expect 2022 capital expenditures to approximate $320 million to support our planned growth, including the multi-year program to replace our ERP system and other initiatives. Our primary investing cash inflow in 2021 was the $65.4 million of proceeds received from the sale of an unconsolidated operation, as more fully discussed in note 5 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nFinancing Cash Flow\n–\nNet cash associated with financing activities was a source of cash of $22.0 million in 2021 and $220.9 million in 2020. Net cash used in financing activities was $725.8 million in 2019. The variability between years is principally a result of changes in our net borrowings, share repurchase activity and dividends, all as described below.\n39\nThe following table outlines our net borrowing activities:\nIn 2021, we borrowed $1,001.5 million under long-term borrowing arrangements, including net proceeds of $495.7 million of 0.9% notes due February 2026 and net proceeds of $492.8 million of 1.85% notes due February 2031. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to pay down short-term borrowings, including a portion of the $1,443.0 million of commercial paper issued to fund our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, and for general corporate purposes. We also repaid $257.1 million of long-term debt, including the $250 million, 3.90% notes that matured in July 2021.\nIn 2020, we borrowed $527.0 million under long-term borrowing arrangements, including net proceeds of $495.0 million of 2.5% notes due April 2030. We also repaid $257.7 million of long-term debt, including $250.0 million associated with our term loans due in August 2022.\nIn 2019, we repaid $447.7 million of long-term debt, including $436.3 million of our $1,500.0 million term loans issued in August 2017.\nThe following table outlines the activity in our share repurchase programs:\nAs of November 30, 2021, $576 million remained of a $600 million share repurchase program that was authorized by our Board of Directors in November 2019. The timing and amount of any shares repurchased is determined by our management based on its evaluation of market conditions and other factors. Our share repurchase activity in 2021, 2020, and 2019 has principally been executed in order to mitigate the effect of shares issued upon the exercise of stock options.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received proceeds of $13.5 million, $56.6 million and $90.9 million, respectively, from exercised stock options. We repurchased $15.4 million, $13.0 million and $12.7 million of common stock during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in conjunction with employee tax withholding requirements associated with our stock compensation plans.\nOur dividend history over the past three years is as follows:\nIn November 2021, the Board of Directors approved an 8.8% increase in the quarterly dividend from $0.34 to $0.37 per share.\nMost of our cash is in our subsidiaries outside of the U.S. We manage our worldwide cash requirements by considering available funds among the many subsidiaries through which we conduct our business and the cost effectiveness with which those funds can be accessed. Prior to the enactment of the U.S. Tax Act on December 22, 2017, the permanent repatriation of cash balances from certain of our non-U.S. subsidiaries could have had adverse tax consequences; however, those balances are generally available without legal restrictions to fund ordinary business operations, capital projects and future acquisitions. As of November 30, 2021, we have $1.3 billion of earnings from our non-U.S. subsidiaries and joint ventures that are considered indefinitely reinvested.  While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes, state income taxes, or foreign exchange gains or losses. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these indefinitely reinvested foreign earnings.\nAt November 30, 2021, we temporarily used $334.8 million of cash from our non-U.S. subsidiaries to pay down short-term debt in the U.S. During the year, our short-term borrowings vary, but are lower at the end of a year or\n40\nquarter. The average short-term borrowings outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2021 and 2020 were $1,029.9 million and $518.1 million, respectively. Those average short-term borrowings outstanding for the year ended November 30, 2021 included average commercial paper borrowings of $975.0 million. The total average debt outstanding for the years ended November 30, 2021 and 2020 was $5,574.5 million and $4,327.4 million, respectively.\nCredit and Capital Markets\n– The following summarizes the more significant impacts of credit and capital markets on our business:\nCREDIT FACILITIES\n– Cash flows from operating activities are our primary source of liquidity for funding growth, share repurchases, dividends and capital expenditures. We also rely on our revolving credit facility, or borrowings backed by this facility, to fund working capital needs and other general corporate requirements.\nIn June 2021, we entered into a five-year $1.5 billion revolving credit facility, which will expire in June 2026. The current pricing for the credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is LIBOR plus 1.25%. The pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to LIBOR plus 1.75%. The provisions of this revolving credit facility restrict subsidiary indebtedness and require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. We do not expect that this covenant would limit our access to this revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future. This facility replaced the following prior revolving credit facilities: (i) a five-year $1.0 billion revolving credit facility that was due to expire in August 2022, and (ii) a 364-day $1.0 billion revolving facility, which we entered into in the first quarter of 2021 that was due to expire in December 2021. The terms of those revolving credit facilities are more fully described in note 6 of the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe generally use our revolving credit facility to support our issuance of commercial paper. If the commercial paper market is not available or viable, we could borrow directly under our revolving credit facility. This facility is made available by a syndicate of banks, with various commitments per bank. If any of the banks in this syndicate are unable to perform on their commitments, our liquidity could be impacted, which could reduce our ability to grow through funding of seasonal working capital. We engage in regular communication with all banks participating in our credit facility. During these communications, none of the banks have indicated that they may be unable to perform on their commitments. In addition, we periodically review our banking and financing relationships, considering the stability of the institutions and other aspects of the relationships. Based on these communications and our monitoring activities, we believe our banks will perform on their commitments. In addition to our committed revolving credit facility, we have uncommitted facilities of $308.4 million as of November 30, 2021 that can be withdrawn based upon the lenders' discretion. See note 6 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for more details on our financing arrangements.\nWe will continue to have cash requirements to support seasonal working capital needs and capital expenditures, to pay interest, to service debt, and to fund acquisitions. As part of our ongoing operations, we enter into contractual arrangements that obligate us to make future cash payments. Our primary obligations include principal and interest payments on our outstanding short-term borrowings and long-term debt.  In the next year, our most significant debt service obligation is the maturity of our $750.0 million, 2.70% notes due in August 2022. Detail on these contractual obligations follows:\nMATERIAL CASH REQUIREMENTS\nThe following table reflects a summary of our future material cash requirements as of November 30, 2021:\n(a)\nInterest payments include interest payments on short-term borrowings and long-term debt. See notes 6 and 7 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n41\nOur other cash requirements at year end include raw material purchases, lease payments, income taxes, and pension and postretirement benefits. We acquire various raw materials to satisfy our obligations to our customers, and these outstanding purchase obligations can fluctuate throughout the year based on our response to varying raw material cycles; however, these commitments generally do not extend past one year.  In addition, we also have a series of commercial commitments, largely consisting of standby letters of credit. Our standby letters of credit, leases, and pension and other post retirement obligations are more fully described in notes 6, 7 and 11, respectively, of notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nThese obligations impact our liquidity and capital resource needs.  To meet those cash requirements, we intend to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and internally generated funds, to borrow under our existing credit facility or under other short-term borrowing facilities, and depending on market conditions and upon the significance of the cost of a particular debt maturity or acquisition to our then-available sources of funds, to obtain additional short- and long-term financing. We believe that cash provided from these sources will be adequate to meet our future cash requirements.\nPENSION ASSETS AND OTHER INVESTMENTS\n– We hold investments in equity and debt securities in both our qualified defined benefit pension plans and through a rabbi trust for our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan. Cash contributions to pension plans, including unfunded plans, were $15.0 million in 2021, $11.9 million in 2020, and $11.4 million in 2019. It is expected that the 2022 total pension plan contributions will be approximately $15 million. Future increases or decreases in pension liabilities and required cash contributions are highly dependent upon changes in interest rates and the actual return on plan assets. We base our investment of plan assets, in part, on the duration of each plan’s liabilities. Across all of our qualified defined benefit pension plans, approximately 55% of assets are invested in equities, 34% in fixed income investments and 11% in other investments. Assets associated with our nonqualified defined benefit pension plan are primarily invested in corporate-owned life insurance, the value of which approximates an investment mix of 55% in equities and 45% in fixed income investments. See note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements, which provides details on our pension funding.\nCUSTOMERS AND COUNTERPARTIES\n– See the subsequent section of this discussion under the heading \"Market Risk Sensitivity–Credit Risk\".\nACQUISITIONS\nAcquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits.\nIn early fiscal 2021, we purchased FONA.  The purchase price was approximately $708 million, net of cash acquired. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets. Our acquisition of FONA on December 30, 2020 expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories, as well as extends our technology platform and strengthens our capabilities. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. The results of FONA's operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our flavor solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\nOn November 30, 2020, we purchased Cholula for approximately $801 million, net of cash acquired.  The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. Cholula, a premium Mexican hot sauce brand, is a strong addition to McCormick’s global branded flavor portfolio, which broadens the Company’s offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce. The results of Cholula’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.\nWe did not have any acquisitions in fiscal 2019.\nSee note 2 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details regarding these acquisitions.\nPERFORMANCE GRAPH — SHAREHOLDER RETURN\nThe following line graph compares the yearly change in McCormick’s cumulative total shareholder return (stock price appreciation plus reinvestment of dividends) on McCormick’s Non-Voting Common Stock with (1) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s 500 Stock Price Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends, and (2) the cumulative total return of the Standard & Poor’s Packaged Foods & Meats Index, assuming reinvestment of dividends.\n42\nMARKET RISK SENSITIVITY\nWe utilize derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign exchange and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the utilization of written guidelines. The information presented below should be read in conjunction with notes 6 and 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nForeign Exchange Risk\n–\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency in the following main areas: cash flows related to raw material purchases; the translation of foreign currency earnings to U.S. dollars; the effects of foreign currency on loans between subsidiaries and unconsolidated affiliates and on cash flows related to repatriation of earnings of unconsolidated affiliates. Primary exposures include the U.S. dollar versus the Euro, British pound sterling, Chinese renminbi, Canadian dollar,  Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Singapore dollar, Mexican peso, Swiss franc, and Thai baht, as well as the Euro versus the British pound sterling and Australian dollar, and finally the Canadian dollar versus British pound sterling. We routinely enter into foreign currency exchange contracts to manage certain of these foreign currency risks.\nDuring 2021, the foreign currency translation component in other comprehensive income was principally related to the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in our subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling, Euro, Polish zloty, Chinese reminbi, Australian dollar, Canadian dollar and Mexican peso.\n43\nWe also utilize cross currency interest rate swap contracts, which are designated as net investment hedges, to manage the impact of exchange rate fluctuations on our net investments in subsidiaries with a functional currency of the British pound sterling and Euro. Gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nThe following table summarizes the foreign currency exchange contracts held at November 30, 2021. All contracts are valued in U.S. dollars using year-end 2021 exchange rates and have been designated as hedges of foreign currency transactional exposures, firm commitments or anticipated transactions.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT NOVEMBER 30, 2021\nWe had a number of smaller contracts at November 30, 2021 with an aggregate notional value of $16.0 million to purchase or sell other currencies, such as the Romanian leu and Russian ruble. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $0.2 million at November 30, 2021.\nAt November 30, 2020, we had foreign currency exchange contracts for the Euro, British pound sterling, Canadian dollar, Australian dollar, Polish zloty, Swiss franc and other currencies, with a notional value of $383.8 million. The aggregate fair value of these contracts was a loss of $6.8 million at November 30, 2020.\nWe also utilized cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are considered net investment hedges. As of November 30, 2021, we had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of (i) $250 million notional value to receive $250 million at three-month U.S. LIBOR plus 0.685% and pay £194.1 million at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.740% and (ii) £194.1 million notional value to receive £194.1 million at three-month GBP LIBOR plus 0.740% and pay €221.8 million at three-month Euro EURIBOR plus 0.808%. These cross-currency interest rate swap contracts expire in August 2027. For more information, refer to note 8 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nInterest Rate Risk\n–\nOur policy is to manage interest rate risk by entering into both fixed and variable rate debt arrangements. We are exposed to interest rate volatility, with primary exposures related to movements in U.S. Treasury rates, London Interbank Offered Rates (LIBOR), and commercial paper rates. LIBOR will be subject to a transition, or phase out, that will commence on January 1, 2022 with the phase out expected to be completed by June 30, 2023. While LIBOR is the current interest rate benchmark used as a reference rate on our variable rate debt, including our revolving credit facility, synthetic lease, interest rate swaps, and cross currency interest rate swaps, we do not anticipate a significant impact to our financial position from the planned phase out of LIBOR, given our current mix of variable and fixed-rate debt.\nWe also use interest rate swaps to minimize financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of fixed and variable rate debt. The table that follows provides principal cash flows and related interest rates, excluding the effect of interest rate swaps and the amortization of any discounts or fees, by fiscal year of maturity at November 30, 2021. For foreign currency-denominated debt, the information is presented in U.S. dollar equivalents. Variable interest rates are based on the weighted-average rates of the portfolio at the end of the year presented.\n44\nYEARS OF MATURITY AT NOVEMBER 30, 2021\nThe table above displays the debt, including finance leases, by the terms of the original debt instrument without consideration of fair value, interest rate swaps and any loan discounts or origination fees. Interest rate swaps have the following effects:\n•\nWe issued $250 million of 3.50% notes due in 2023 in August 2013. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.30%.\n•\nWe issued $250 million of 3.25% notes due in 2025 in November 2015. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.45%. The fixed interest rate on $100 million of the 3.25% notes due in December 2025 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus 1.22%.\n•\nWe issued $750 million of 3.40% notes due August 15, 2027 and $300 million due in August 2027 in August 2017. Forward treasury lock agreements settled upon issuance of these notes effectively set the interest rate on these $750 million notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of 3.44%. The fixed interest rate on $250 million of the 3.40% notes due in 2027 was effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2027. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus 0.685%.\nCommodity Risk\n– We purchase certain raw materials which are subject to price volatility caused by weather, market conditions, growing and harvesting conditions, governmental actions and other factors beyond our control. In 2021, our most significant raw materials were dairy products, pepper, capsicums (red peppers and paprika), onion, vanilla, garlic, and salt. While future movements of raw material costs are uncertain, we respond to this volatility in a number of ways, including strategic raw material purchases, purchases of raw material for future delivery and customer price adjustments. We generally have not used derivatives to manage the volatility related to this risk.\nCredit Risk\n– The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. Some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties. We feel that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognizes trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nNew accounting pronouncements are issued periodically that affect our current and future operations. See note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for further details of these impacts.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS\nIn preparing the financial statements, we are required to make estimates and assumptions that have an impact on the assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported. These estimates can also affect supplemental information   disclosed by us, including information about contingencies, risk and financial condition. We believe, given current facts and circumstances, our estimates and assumptions are reasonable, adhere to U.S. GAAP and are consistently applied. Inherent in the nature of an estimate or assumption is the fact that actual results may differ from estimates, and estimates may vary as new facts and circumstances arise. In preparing the financial statements, we make routine estimates and judgments in determining the net realizable value of accounts receivable, inventory, fixed assets and prepaid allowances. Our most critical accounting estimates and assumptions, which are those that have or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations, are in the following areas:\nCustomer Contracts\nIn several of our major geographic markets, the consumer segment sells our products by entering into annual or multi-year customer arrangements. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding these programs.  Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one-year or shorter duration. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized. Certain\n45\nof our customer arrangements are annual arrangements such that the degree of estimates that affects revenue reduces as a year progresses.  We do not believe that there will be significant changes to our estimates of customer consideration when any uncertainties are resolved with customers.\nBusiness Combinations, Goodwill and Intangible Asset Valuation\nWe use the acquisition method in accounting for acquired businesses. Under the acquisition method, our financial statements reflect the operations of an acquired business starting from the closing of the acquisition. The assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective estimated fair values at the date of the acquisition. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Significant judgment is often required in estimating the fair value of assets acquired, particularly intangible assets. We generally obtain the assistance of a third-party valuation specialist in estimating fair values of tangible and intangible assets. The fair value estimates are based on available historical information and on expectations and assumptions about the future, considering the perspective of marketplace participants. While management believes those expectations and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nDetermining the useful lives of intangible assets also requires judgment. Certain brand intangibles are expected to have indefinite lives based on their history and our plans to continue to support and build the acquired brands, while other acquired intangible assets (e.g., customer relationships) are expected to have determinable useful lives. Our estimates of the useful lives of definite-lived intangible assets are primarily based upon historical experience, the competitive and macroeconomic environment, and our operating plans. The costs of definite-lived intangibles are amortized to expense over their estimated life. We review the carrying value of goodwill and non-amortizable intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. We also test for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, as more fully described in note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements. While we believe those estimates and assumptions are reasonable, they are inherently uncertain. Unanticipated market or macroeconomic events and circumstances may occur, which could affect the accuracy or validity of the estimates and assumptions.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur reporting units are the same as our operating segments. Determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions, as more fully described in note 1 to our consolidated financial statements. We estimate the fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model. Our discounted cash flow model calculates fair value by present valuing future expected cash flows of our reporting units using a market-based discount rate. We then compare this fair value to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. The quantitative goodwill impairment test requires an entity to compare the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount. As of November 30, 2021, we had $5,335.8 million of goodwill recorded in our balance sheet ($3,674.7 million in the consumer segment and $1,661.1 million in the flavor solutions segment). Our fiscal year 2021 impairment testing indicated that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were significantly in excess of their carrying values. Accordingly, we believe that only significant changes in the cash flow assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.  However, variances between the actual performance of the businesses and the assumptions that were used in developing the estimates of fair value could result in impairment charges in future periods.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of brand names and trademarks. We estimate fair values through the use of the relief-from-royalty method and then compare those fair values to the related carrying amounts of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. In the event that the fair value of any of the brand names or trademarks are less than their related carrying amounts, a non-cash impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to the difference.\nThe estimation of fair values of our brand names and trademarks requires us to make significant assumptions, including expectations with respect to sales and profits of the respective brands and trademarks, related royalty rates, income tax rates and appropriate discount rates, which are based, in part, upon current interest rates\n46\nadjusted for our view of reasonable country- and brand\n-\nspecific risks based upon the past and anticipated future performance of the related brand names and trademarks\n.\nThe assumptions used to assess impairment consider historical trends, macroeconomic conditions, and projections consistent with our operating strategy. Changes in these estimates can have a significant impact on the assessment of fair value which could result in material impairment losses.\nAs of November 30, 2021, we had $3,067.4 million of brand name assets and trademarks recorded in our balance sheet, and none of the balances exceeded their estimated fair values at that date. Of the $3,067.4 million of brand names assets and trademarks as of November 30, 2021:  (i) $2,320.0 million relates to the French’s, Frank’s RedHot and Cattlemen’s brand names and trademarks, recognized as part of our acquisition of RB Foods in August 2017, that we group for purposes of our impairment analysis; (ii) $380.0 million relates to the Cholula brand names and trademarks associated with the acquisition of Cholula in November 2020, (iii) $49.0 million relates to the FONA brand names and trademarks associated with the acquisition of FONA in December 2020 and (iv) the remaining $318.4 million represents a number of other brand name assets and trademarks with individual carrying values ranging from $0.2 million to $106.4 million. Except for our recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, the percentage excess of estimated fair value over respective book values for each of our brand names and trademarks, including the $2,320.0 million related to our French’s, Frank's RedHot and Cattlemen’s brands, was 20% or more as of November 30, 2021.\nThe brand names and trademarks related to recent acquisitions, including our recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, may be more susceptible to future impairment as their carrying values represent recently determined fair values. A change in assumptions with respect to recently acquired businesses, including those affected by rising interest rates or a deterioration in expectations of future sales, profitability or royalty rates as well as future economic and market conditions, or higher income tax rates, could result in non-cash impairment losses in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nWe estimate income taxes and file tax returns in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and are required to file a tax return. At the end of each year, an estimate for income taxes is recorded in the financial statements. Tax returns are generally filed in the third or fourth quarter of the subsequent year. A reconciliation of the estimate to the final tax return is done at that time, which will result in changes to the original estimate. We believe that our tax return positions are appropriately supported, but tax authorities can challenge certain of our tax positions. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions in accordance with the GAAP guidance for uncertainty in income taxes. We recognize a tax benefit when it is more likely than not the position will be sustained upon examination, based on its technical merits. The tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement. A change in judgment related to the expected ultimate resolution of uncertain tax positions will be recognized in earnings in the quarter of such change. We believe that our reserve for uncertain tax positions, including related interest and penalties, is adequate. As of November 30, 2021, the Company had $31.0 million of unrecognized tax benefits, including interest and penalties, recorded in Other long-term liabilities. The amounts ultimately paid upon resolution of audits could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax expense and, therefore, could have a material impact on our tax provision, net income and cash flows. We have recorded valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. In doing so, we have considered future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance. Both future taxable income and tax planning strategies include a number of estimates, as more fully described in note 1 of notes to our consolidated financial statements.\nPension Benefits\nPension plans’ costs require the use of assumptions for discount rates, investment returns, projected salary increases, and mortality rates. The actuarial assumptions used in our pension benefit reporting are reviewed annually and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they appropriately account for our future pension benefit obligations. While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, changes in various assumptions and differences between the actual returns on plan assets and the expected returns on plan assets and changes to projected future rates of return on plan assets will affect the amount of pension expense or income ultimately recognized. A 1% increase or decrease in the actuarial assumption for the discount rate would impact 2022 pension benefit expense by approximately $1 million. A 1% increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would impact 2022 pension expense by approximately $10 million.\n47\nWe will continue to evaluate the appropriateness of the assumptions used in the measurement of our pension benefit obligations. In addition, see note 11 of notes to our consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these assumptions and the effects on the financial statements."

The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with United States generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on our estimates and judgments. All other financial information in this report has been presented on a basis consistent with the information included in the financial statements.\nWe are also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. We maintain a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition.\nOur control environment is the foundation for our system of internal control over financial reporting and is embodied in our Business Ethics Policy. It sets the tone of our organization and includes factors such as integrity and ethical values. Our internal control over financial reporting is supported by formal policies and procedures which are reviewed, modified and improved as changes occur in business conditions and operations.\nThe Audit Committee of the Board of Directors, which is composed solely of independent directors, meets periodically with members of management, the internal auditors and the independent registered public accounting firm to review and discuss internal control over financial reporting and accounting and financial reporting matters. The independent registered public accounting firm and internal auditors report to the Audit Committee and accordingly have full and free access to the Audit Committee at any time.\nWe conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting based on the framework in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework). This assessment included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this assessment. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, based on our assessment, we have concluded with reasonable assurance that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of November 30, 2021.\nOur internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2021 has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP.\n50\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of McCormick & Company, Incorporated\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited McCormick & Company, Incorporated’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, McCormick & Company, Incorporated (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, cash flow statements and statements of shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at item 15(2) and our report dated January 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Report of Management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJanuary 27, 2022\n51\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of McCormick & Company, Incorporated\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of McCormick & Company, Incorporated (the Company) as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated income statements, statements of comprehensive income, cash flow statements and statements of shareholders’ equity for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at item 15(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at November 30, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended November 30, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of November 30, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated January 27, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n52\n53\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1982.\nBaltimore, Maryland\nJanuary 27, 2022\n54\nCONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENTS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n55\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n56\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nCONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENTS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n58\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n59\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nConsolidation\nThe financial statements include the accounts of our majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries and affiliates. Intercompany transactions have been eliminated. Investments in unconsolidated affiliates, over which we exercise significant influence, but not control, are accounted for by the equity method. Accordingly, our share of net income or loss from unconsolidated affiliates is included in net income.\nForeign Currency Translation\nFor majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries and affiliates, if located outside of the U.S., with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date and the resultant translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions of these majority-owned or controlled subsidiaries and affiliates\n—\nthat is, transactions denominated in other than their functional currency — other than intercompany transactions designated as long-term investments, are included in net earnings.\nOur unconsolidated affiliates located outside the U.S. generally use their local currencies as their functional currencies. The asset and liability accounts of those unconsolidated affiliates are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet date, with the resultant translation adjustments included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of those affiliates. Income and expense items of those affiliates are translated at average monthly rates of exchange. We record our ownership share of the net assets and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) of our unconsolidated affiliates in our consolidated balance sheet on the lines entitled “Other long-term assets” and “Accumulated other comprehensive loss,” respectively. We record our ownership share of the net income of our unconsolidated affiliates, or a gain or loss associated with the sale of our ownership interest in our unconsolidated affiliates, in our consolidated income statement on the line entitled “Income from unconsolidated operations.”\nUse of Estimates\nPreparation of financial statements that follow accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and notes. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAll highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalents.\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined under the first-in, first-out costing method (FIFO), including the use of average costs which approximate FIFO.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost and depreciated over its estimated useful life using the straight-line method for financial reporting and both accelerated and straight-line methods for tax reporting. The estimated useful lives range from\n20\nto\n50\nyears for buildings and\n3\nto\n12\nyears for machinery, equipment and other assets. Assets leased under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that we will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\nComputer Software\nWe capitalize costs of software developed or obtained for internal use. Capitalized software development costs include only (1) direct costs paid to others for materials and services to develop or buy the software, (2) payroll and payroll-related costs for employees who work directly on the software development project and (3) interest costs while developing the software. Capitalization of these costs stops when the project is substantially complete and ready for use.\nThe net book value of capitalized software totaled $\n141.1\nmillion and $\n116.0\nmillion at November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such amounts are recorded within \"Other long-term assets\" in the consolidated balance sheet. Software is amortized using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from\n3\nto\n13\nyears, but not\n60\nexceeding the expected life of the product. The net book value of capitalized software includes $\n12.2\nmillion and $\n86.7\nmillion at November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, which had not yet been placed into service and relates to our future implementation of a global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nWe review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and conduct tests of impairment on an annual basis as described below. We also test goodwill for impairment if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount and test indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. Separable intangible assets that have finite useful lives are amortized over those lives.\nDetermining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived purchased intangible asset is judgmental in nature and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows, risk-adjusted discount rates, assumed royalty rates, future economic and market conditions and determination of appropriate market comparables. We base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain. Actual future results may differ from these estimates.\nGoodwill Impairment\nOur reporting units used to assess potential goodwill impairment are the same as our business segments. We calculate fair value of a reporting unit by using a discounted cash flow model and then compare that to the carrying amount of the reporting unit, including intangible assets and goodwill. An impairment charge would be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds the calculated fair value of the reporting unit.\nIndefinite-lived Intangible Asset Impairment\nOur indefinite-lived intangible assets consist of acquired brand names and trademarks. We determine fair value by using a relief-from-royalty method and then compare that to the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset. If the carrying amount of the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded to the extent the recorded indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds the fair value.\nLong-lived Asset Impairment\nFixed assets and amortizable intangible assets are reviewed for impairment as events or changes in circumstances occur indicating that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. Undiscounted cash flow analyses are used to determine if an impairment exists. If an impairment is determined to exist, the loss would be calculated based on the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its estimated fair value.\nLeases\nWe determine whether a contract is or contains a lease at contract inception based on the presence of identified assets and our right to obtain substantially all the economic benefit from or to direct the use of such assets. When we determine a lease exists, we record a right-of-use (“ROU”) asset and corresponding lease liability on our consolidated balance sheet. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term. Lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. ROU assets are recognized at the lease commencement date at the value of the lease liability and are adjusted for any prepayments, lease incentives received, and initial direct costs incurred. Lease liabilities are recognized at the lease commencement date based on the present value of remaining lease payments over the lease term. As the discount rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable in most of our leases, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option.\nWe do not record lease contracts with a term of 12 months or less on our consolidated balance sheets.\nWhen our real estate lease arrangements include lease and non-lease components (for example, common area maintenance), we account for each component separately, based on their relative standalone prices. For all other asset categories, we combine lease components and non-lease components into a single lease commitment.\nWe recognize fixed lease expense for operating leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, we recognize amortization expense over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the underlying assets or the lease term. In instances of title transfer, expense is recognized over the useful life. Interest expense on a finance lease is recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term.\nRevenue Recognition\n61\nWe manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products to the entire food industry—retailers, food manufacturers and foodservice businesses. Our revenue arrangements generally include a single performance obligation relating to the fulfillment of a customer order, which in some cases are governed by a master sales agreement, for the purchase of our products. We recognize revenue at a point in time when control of the ordered products passes to the customer, which principally occurs either upon shipment or delivery to the customer or upon pick-up by the customer, depending upon terms included in the particular customer arrangement. Revenues are recorded net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates and returns, are estimated at the time of sale. All taxes assessed by a governmental authority that are both imposed on and concurrent with a specific revenue-producing transaction and collected by us from a customer for sales, value added and other excise taxes are excluded from net sales. We account for product shipping and handling activities that occur before the customer has obtained control of a good as fulfillment activities (i.e. an expense) rather than as a promised service with costs for these activities recorded within Cost of goods sold. We expense any incremental costs of obtaining a contract when the contract is for a period of one year or less.\nAmounts billed and due from our customers are classified as accounts receivable on the balance sheet and require payment on a short-term basis.  Our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of probable non-payments and credit losses in our existing receivables, as determined based on a review of past due balances and other specific account data.\nThe following table sets forth our net sales by the Americas, Europe, Middle East and Africa (EMEA) and Asia/Pacific (APAC) geographic regions:\nPerformance Obligations\nOur revenues primarily result from contracts or purchase orders with customers, which generally are both short-term in nature and have a single performance obligation—the delivery of our products to customers.  We assess the goods and services promised in our customers’ contracts or purchase orders and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer a good or service (or bundle of goods or services) that is distinct. To identify the performance obligations, we consider all the goods or services promised, whether explicitly stated or implied based on customary business practices.\nSignificant Judgments\nSales are recorded net of trade and sales incentives and estimated product returns. Known or expected pricing or revenue adjustments, such as trade discounts, rebates or returns, are estimated at the time of sale. Where applicable, future reimbursements are estimated based on a combination of historical patterns and future expectations regarding these programs.  Key sales terms, such as pricing and quantities ordered, are established on a frequent basis such that most customer arrangements and related incentives have a one-year or shorter duration. Estimates that affect revenue, such as trade incentives and product returns, are monitored and adjusted each period until the incentives or product returns are realized.  The adjustments recognized during the year ended November 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 resulting from updated estimates of revenue for prior year product sales were not significant.  The unsettled portion remaining in accrued liabilities for these activities was $\n189.3\nmillion and $\n183.3\nmillion at November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nShipping and Handling\nShipping and handling costs on our products sold to customers related to activities that occur before the customer has obtained control of a good are included in cost of goods sold in the consolidated income statement.\nBrand Marketing Support\n62\nTotal brand marketing support costs, which are included in our consolidated income statement in the line entitled \"Selling, general and administrative expense\", were $\n237.8\nmillion, $\n230.3\nmillion and $\n214.6\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Brand marketing support costs include advertising and promotions but exclude trade funds paid to customers for such activities. All trade funds paid to customers are reflected in the consolidated income statement as a reduction of net sales. Promotion costs include public relations, shopper marketing, social marketing activities, general consumer promotion activities and depreciation of assets used in these promotional activities. Advertising costs include the development, production and communication of advertisements through television, digital, print and radio. Development and production costs are expensed in the period in which the advertisement is first run. All other costs of advertising are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $\n182.6\nmillion, $\n174.8\nmillion and $\n150.8\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs are expensed as incurred and are included in our consolidated income statement in the line entitled \"Selling, general and administrative expense\". Research and development expense was $\n87.3\nmillion, $\n68.6\nmillion and $\n67.3\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are recognized in accordance with the liability method of accounting. Deferred taxes are recognized for the estimated taxes ultimately payable or recoverable based on enacted tax law. Inherent in determining our annual tax rate are judgments regarding business plans, planning opportunities, and expectations about future outcomes. Realization of certain deferred tax assets, primarily net operating loss and other carryforwards, is dependent upon generating sufficient taxable income in the appropriate jurisdiction prior to the expiration of the carryforward periods. Changes in enacted tax rates are reflected in the tax provision as they occur.\nWe record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. When assessing the need for valuation allowances, we consider future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. Should a change in circumstances lead to a change in judgment about the realizability of deferred tax assets in future years, we would adjust related valuation allowances in the period that the change in circumstances occurs, along with a corresponding adjustment to our provision for income taxes.\nWe recognize a tax position in our financial statements when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position. That position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\nThe resolution of tax reserves and changes in valuation allowances could be material to our results of operations for any period but is not expected to be material to our financial position.\nEffective December 1, 2018, we are subject to a U.S. tax requirement that certain income earned by foreign subsidiaries, referred to as Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI), must be included in the gross income of the subsidiary’s U.S. shareholder. Accounting principles generally accepted in the U.S. provide for an accounting policy election of either recognizing deferred taxes for temporary differences expected to reverse as GILTI in future years or recognizing such taxes as a current period expense when incurred.  We have elected to treat GILTI as a current period expense when incurred.\nStock-Based Compensation\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with options and restricted stock units (RSUs), which contain provisions that such awards fully vest upon an employee’s retirement, ratably over the shorter of the vesting period or the employees’ retirement eligibility date. Accordingly, we recognize stock-based compensation associated with options and RSUs subject to immediate retirement eligible vesting provisions on the date of grant.\nCompensation expense associated with our long-term performance plan (LTPP) is recorded in the income statement ratably over the three-year period of the program based on the number of shares ultimately expected to be awarded using our estimate of the most likely outcome of achieving the performance objectives.\nWe recognize stock-based compensation expense associated with price-vested stock options ratably over the vesting period as such options do not contain provisions that fully vest these awards upon an employee becoming retirement eligible.\nWe estimate forfeitures associated with all stock-based compensation at the time of grant based on historical experience and revise this estimate in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ.\nStock Split\n63\nOn September 28, 2020, our Board of Directors approved a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend on all shares of the Company’s two classes of common stock, Common Stock and Common Stock Non-Voting. On November 30, 2020, one like share was issued for each share outstanding to shareholders of record as of November 20, 2020. Trading of the Company’s common stock began on a split-adjusted basis on December 1, 2020. All common stock and per-share data have been retroactively adjusted for the impact of the stock split.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe record all derivatives on our balance sheet at fair value.  The fair value of derivative instruments is recorded in our consolidated balance sheet on the lines entitled “Other current assets\", \"Other long-term assets\", \"Other accrued liabilities\" or \"Other long-term liabilities\" depending on their fair value and maturity. Gains and losses representing either hedge ineffectiveness, hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness, or hedges of translational exposure are recorded in our consolidated income statement in the lines entitled \"Other income (expense), net\" or \"Interest expense\". In our consolidated cash flow statement, settlements of cash flow and fair value hedges are classified as operating activities; settlements of all other derivative instruments, including instruments for which hedge accounting has been discontinued, are classified consistent with the nature of the instruments.\nCash flow hedges.\nQualifying derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges when the hedged item is a forecasted transaction. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet on the line entitled “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" until the underlying transaction is recorded in earnings. When the hedged item is realized, gains or losses are reclassified from \"Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in our consolidated balance sheet to our consolidated income statement on the same line items as the underlying transactions.\nFair value hedges.\nQualifying derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges when the hedged item is a recognized asset, liability, or firm commitment. Gains and losses on these instruments are recorded in earnings, offsetting gains and losses on the hedged item.\nNet investment hedges.\nQualifying derivative and nonderivative financial instruments are accounted for as net investment hedges when the hedged item is a nonfunctional currency investment in a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these instruments are included in foreign currency translation adjustments, a component of “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\" in our consolidated balance sheet.\nEmployee Benefit and Retirement Plans\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and certain foreign locations. In addition, we sponsor defined contribution plans in the U.S. We contribute to defined contribution plans in locations outside the U.S., including government-sponsored retirement plans. We also currently provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. employees and retirees.\nWe recognize the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit pension plans as an asset or a liability in our balance sheet, with changes in the funded status recorded through other comprehensive income in the year in which those changes occur.\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and a calculated value of plan assets referred to as the market-related value of plan assets. Differences between assumed and actual returns are amortized to the market-related value of assets on a straight-line basis over five years.\nWe use the corridor approach in the valuation of defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans. The corridor approach defers all actuarial gains and losses resulting from variances between actual results and actuarial assumptions. Those unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. The amount in excess of the corridor is amortized over the average remaining life expectancy of retired plan participants, for plans whose benefits have been frozen, or the average remaining service period to retirement date of active plan participants.\nAccounting Pronouncements Adopted in 2021\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04\nIntangibles\n—\nGoodwill and Other Topics (Topic 350)\n:\nSimplifying the Test for Goodwill Impairment.\nThis guidance eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill of a reporting unit to measure a goodwill impairment charge. Instead, a company will record an impairment charge based on the excess of a reporting unit's carrying amount over its fair value. This new standard\n64\nwas adopted effective December 1, 2020 and will be applied upon recognition of any future goodwill impairment charge. This ASU has not had a material impact on our financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13\nFinancial Instruments\n—\nCredit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n, which instituted a new model for recognizing credit losses on financial instruments that are not measured at fair value. This standard was adopted by the Company on December 1, 2020. As this ASU did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements upon adoption, a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings was not necessary.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements — Pending Adoption\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n, which simplifies the accounting for income taxes.  The new guidance removes certain exceptions to the general principles for income taxes and also improves consistent application of accounting by clarifying or amending existing guidance.  The new standard is effective for the first quarter of our fiscal year ending November 30, 2022, and interim periods within those years.  We do not expect the new guidance will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nIn  March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting\nthat provides optional expedients for a limited period of time for accounting for contracts, hedging relationship, and other transactions affected by the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) or other reference rates expected to be discontinued.  These optional expedients can be applied from March 2020 through December 31, 2022.  We are currently evaluating the impact that the new guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements.\n2.\nACQUISITIONS\nAcquisitions are part of our strategy to increase sales and profits.\nAcquisition of FONA International, LLC\nOn December 30, 2020, we purchased FONA International, LLC and certain of its affiliates (FONA), a privately held company, for a purchase price of approximately $\n708.2\nmillion, net of cash acquired. That purchase price includes the payment of $\n2.6\nmillion during 2021 associated with the final working capital adjustment. FONA is a leading manufacturer of clean and natural flavors providing solutions for a diverse customer base across various applications for the food, beverage and nutritional markets. The acquisition of FONA expands the breadth of our flavor solutions segment into attractive categories, as well as extends our technology platform and strengthens our capabilities. The acquisition was funded with cash and commercial paper. At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of FONA were approximately $\n114\nmillion. The results of FONA’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our flavor solutions segment from the date of acquisition.\nThe purchase price of FONA was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We estimated the fair values based on independent valuations, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management.\nThe final purchase price allocation for FONA resulted in the following fair value allocations, net of cash acquired (in millions):\n65\nWe determined the fair value of intangible assets using the following methodologies. We valued the acquired brand names and trademarks and intellectual property using the relief from royalty method, an income approach. We valued the acquired customer relationships using the excess earnings method, an income approach. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, operating profit margin, and working capital/contributory asset charges), royalty rates, the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management plans, and market comparables.\nWe used carrying values to value trade receivables and payables, as well as certain other current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items. We valued finished goods and work-in-process inventory using a net realizable value approach, which resulted in a step-up of $\n1.4\nmillion that was recognized in Cost of goods sold during 2021, as the related inventory was sold. Raw materials and packaging inventory were valued using the replacement cost approach.\nThe valuation of the acquired net assets of FONA includes $\n49.0\nmillion allocated to indefinite-lived brand assets, $\n173.0\nmillion allocated to customer relationships with an estimated useful life of\n15\nyears and $\n44.0\nmillion allocated to intellectual property with an estimated useful life of\n12\nyears. As a result of the acquisition, we recognized a total of $\n389.7\nmillion of goodwill. That goodwill primarily represents the intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, our insights in demand from customers for value-added flavor solutions, and our supply chain capabilities, as well as expected synergies from the combined operations and assembled workforce. Our aggregate income tax basis in the acquired intangible assets and goodwill approximates their aggregate book value at the acquisition date.\nAcquisition of Cholula Hot Sauce\nOn November 30, 2020, we completed the acquisition of the parent company of Cholula Hot Sauce\n®\n(Cholula) from\nL\nCatterton. The purchase price was approximately $\n801.2\nmillion, net of cash acquired. That purchase price is also net of $\n1.5\nmillion received during 2021 associated with the final working capital adjustment. The acquisition was funded with cash and short-term borrowings. Cholula, a premium Mexican hot sauce brand, is a strong addition to McCormick’s global branded flavor portfolio, which we believe broadens our offering in the high growth hot sauce category to consumers and foodservice operators and accelerates our condiment growth opportunities with a complementary authentic Mexican flavor hot sauce.  At the time of the acquisition, annual sales of Cholula were approximately $\n96\nmillion. The results of Cholula’s operations have been included in our financial statements as a component of our consumer and flavor solutions segments from the date of acquisition.\nThe purchase price of Cholula was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their estimated fair values at the date of acquisition. We estimated the fair values based on independent valuations, discounted cash flow analyses, quoted market prices, and estimates made by management.\nDuring 2021, we completed the Cholula purchase price allocation. The final purchase price allocation for Cholula resulted in the following fair value allocations, net of cash acquired (in millions):\nThe fair value of intangible assets was determined using income methodologies. We valued the acquired brand names and trademarks using the relief from royalty method, an income approach. For customer relationships, we\n66\nused the distributor method, a variation of the excess earnings method that uses distributor-based inputs for margins and contributory asset charges. Some of the more significant assumptions inherent in developing the valuations included the estimated annual net cash flows for each indefinite-lived or definite-lived intangible asset (including net sales, operating profit margin, and working capital/contributory asset charges), royalty rates, the discount rate that appropriately reflects the risk inherent in each future cash flow stream, the assessment of each asset’s life cycle, and competitive trends, as well as other factors. We determined the assumptions used in the financial forecasts using historical data, supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions, estimated product category growth rates, management plans, and market comparables.\nWe used carrying values to value trade receivables and payables, as well as certain other current and non-current assets and liabilities, as we determined that they represented the fair value of those items.\nWe valued finished goods and work-in-process inventory using a net realizable value approach, which resulted in a step-up of $\n4.9\nmillion that was recognized in cost of goods sold in 2021 as the related inventory was sold. Raw materials and packaging inventory was valued using the replacement cost approach.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and their tax bases.\nThe valuation of the acquired net assets of Cholula includes $\n380.0\nmillion allocated to indefinite-lived brand assets and $\n21.0\nmillion allocated to definite-lived intangible assets with an estimated useful life of\n15\nyears. As a result of the acquisition, we recognized a total of $\n411.3\nmillion of goodwill. That goodwill primarily represents the intangible assets that do not qualify for separate recognition, such as the value of leveraging our brand building expertise, our insights in demand from consumer and flavor solutions customers for value-added flavor solutions, and our supply chain capabilities, as well as expected synergies from the combined operations and assembled workforce. Our income tax basis in the acquired intangible assets and goodwill approximates $\n285\nmillion.\nTransaction and Integration Expenses Associated with the Cholula and FONA Acquisitions\nThe following are the Transaction and integration expenses recognized related to the Cholula and FONA acquisitions for the years ended November 30 (in millions):\nWe expect additional transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisition of Cholula and FONA to total approximately $\n3\nmillion in 2022.\n3.\nSPECIAL CHARGES\nIn our consolidated income statement, we include a separate line item captioned “Special charges” in arriving at our consolidated operating income. Special charges consist of expenses, including related impairment charges, associated with certain actions undertaken to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness and are of such significance in terms of both up-front costs and organizational/structural impact to require advance approval by our Management Committee, comprised of our senior management, including our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Upon presentation of any such proposed action (generally including details with respect to estimated costs, which typically consist principally of employee severance and related benefits, together with ancillary costs associated with the action that may include a non-cash component, such as an asset impairment, or a component which relates to inventory adjustments that are included in cost of goods sold; impacted employees or operations; expected timing; and expected savings) to the Management Committee and the Committee’s advance approval, expenses associated with the approved action are classified as special charges upon recognition and monitored on an on-going basis through completion. Certain ancillary expenses related to these actions approved by our Management Committee do not qualify for accrual upon approval but are included as special charges as incurred during the course of the actions.\n67\nThe following is a summary of special charges recognized for the years ended November 30 (in millions):\n(1)\nIncluded in other costs for 2021 are non-cash intangible asset impairment charges of $\n11.2\nmillion and a non-cash fixed asset impairment charge of $\n6.0\nmillion.\nThe following is a summary of special charges by business segments for the years ended November 30 (in millions):\nWe continue to evaluate changes to our organization structure to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and improve our competitiveness.\nDuring 2021, we recorded $\n51.1\nmillion of special charges, of which $\n46.4\nmillion was recognized in Special charges and $\n4.7\nmillion was recognized in Cost of goods sold on our consolidated income statement. Special charges in 2021 consist principally of $\n19.5\nmillion associated with our exit of our rice product line in India, as more fully described below, $\n6.2\nmillion associated with the transition of a manufacturing facility in EMEA, streamlining actions of $\n10.3\nmillion in the Americas region, $\n4.8\nmillion in the EMEA region and $\n0.8\nmillion in the APAC region, and $\n0.8\nmillion related to our GE initiative, together with a non-cash asset impairment charge of $\n6.0\nmillion associated with an administrative site that was sold in conjunction with our decision to employ a hybrid work environment. As of November 30, 2021, reserves associated with special charges are included in the line entitled \"Trade accounts payable\" and \"Other accrued liabilities\" in our consolidated balance sheet.\nIn 2021, we recorded a total of $\n19.5\nmillion of special charges related to the exit of our Kohinoor rice product line in India. This action principally relates to the discontinuance of Kohinoor's rice business consistent with our focus on higher margin products to enable the business to focus on both its flavor solutions and non-rice consumer business.  As a result of the Kohinoor rice product line exit, we determined that an impairment of the Kohinoor brand name had occurred in 2021 and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n7.4\nmillion reducing its carrying value to zero.  Also, as a result of this action, we determined that the value of our customer relationship asset in India was also impaired as a result of the lower level of anticipated sales and recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $\n3.8\nmillion.  We also recorded $\n3.6\nmillion of employee severance and other related exit costs associated directly associated with the exit plan. We anticipate that these costs will be paid within the next twelve months. In addition, as a result of the Kohinoor product line discontinuance in 2021, we recognized a $\n4.7\nmillion charge in cost of goods sold, which represents a provision for the excess of the carrying value of rice inventories over the estimated net realizable value of such discontinued inventories and a contractual obligation associated with terminating a rice supply agreement.\nDuring 2020, we recorded $\n6.9\nmillion of special charges, consisting of (i) $\n5.3\nmillion related to streamlining actions in our EMEA region, including $\n3.8\nmillion related to severance and related benefits and $\n1.0\nmillion of third party expenses and $\n0.5\nmillion related to other costs; and (ii) $\n1.6\nmillion related to our GE initiative. Of the $\n6.9\nmillion in special charges recorded during 2020, approximately $\n4.8\nmillion were paid in cash, with the remaining accrual paid in 2021.\nDuring 2019, we recorded $\n20.8\nmillion of special charges, consisting primarily of (i) $\n14.1\nmillion related to our GE initiative, including $\n10.6\nmillion of third-party expenses, $\n2.1\nmillion related to severance and related benefits, and $\n1.4\nmillion related to other costs, (ii) $\n2.3\nmillion of employee severance and related benefits associated with streamlining actions in the Americas and (iii) $\n3.9\nmillion related to streamlining actions in our EMEA region. Of the $\n20.8\nmillion in special charges recorded during 2019, approximately $\n16.8\nmillion were paid in cash, with the remaining accrual paid in 2020.\nDuring 2017, our Management Committee approved a multi-year initiative during which we have executed and expect to continue to execute significant changes to our global processes, capabilities and operating model to provide a scalable platform for future growth. We expect this initiative to enable us to accelerate our ability to work globally and cross-functionally by aligning and simplifying processes throughout McCormick, in part building upon our current shared services foundation and expanding the end-to-end processes presently under that foundation. We expect this initiative, which we refer to as Global Enablement (GE), to enable this scalable platform for future growth while reducing costs, enabling faster decision making, increasing agility and creating capacity within our organization.\nWhile we are continuing to fully develop the details of our GE operating model, we expect the cost of the GE initiative—to be recognized as “Special charges” in our consolidated income statement over its multi-year course—to range from approximately $\n60\nmillion to $\n65\nmillion. Of that $\n60\nmillion to $\n65\nmillion, we estimate that approximately sixty percent will be attributable to cash payments associated with related costs of GE implementation and transition, including outside consulting and other costs and approximately forty percent will be attributable to employee severance and related benefit payments both directly related to the initiative. Since its inception through November 30, 2021, we\nhave recognized a total of $\n40.7\nmillion of special charges associated with our GE initiative.\n4.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table displays intangible assets as of November 30:\nWe acquired FONA in December 2020 (see note 2). The valuation of the acquired net assets of FONA resulted in the allocation of $\n389.7\nmillion to goodwill, $\n49.0\nmillion to indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the acquired brand names and trademarks, and $\n217.0\nmillion to definite-lived intangible assets.\nWe acquired Cholula in November 2020 (see note 2). The valuation of the acquired net assets of Cholula resulted in the allocation of $\n411.3\nmillion to goodwill, $\n380.0\nmillion to indefinite-lived intangible assets associated with the acquired brand names and trademarks, and $\n21.0\nmillion to definite-lived intangible assets.\nIntangible asset amortization expense was $\n35.6\nmillion, $\n20.2\nmillion and $\n20.3\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At November 30, 2021, definite-lived intangible assets had a weighted-average remaining life of approximately\n12\nyears.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment for the years ended November 30 were as follows:\nIn 2020, a preliminary valuation of the acquired net assets of Cholula resulted in the allocation of $\n273.7\nmillion and $\n136.8\nmillion of goodwill to the consumer segment and flavor solutions segment, respectively. In 2021, we finalized the allocation of the purchase price of Cholula, which resulted in an increase in goodwill of $\n0.5\nmillion to the\nconsumer segment and $\n0.3\nmillion to the flavor solutions segment. The December 2020 FONA acquisition resulted in the allocation of $\n389.7\nmillion of goodwill to the flavor solutions segment.\nAs more fully described in note 3, in 2021, we recorded non-cash impairment charges of $\n7.4\nmillion and $\n3.8\nmillion associated with the Kohinoor brand name and customer relationship asset in India, respectively.\n5.\nINVESTMENTS IN AFFILIATES\nIncome from unconsolidated operations was $\n52.2\nmillion, $\n40.8\nmillion, and $\n40.9\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Income from unconsolidated operations in 2021 includes a gain on a sale of unconsolidated operations of $\n13.4\nmillion as described below.  Our principal earnings from unconsolidated affiliates is from our\n50\n% interest in McCormick de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. Profit from this joint venture represented\n62\n% of income from unconsolidated operations in 2021,\n75\n% in 2020 and\n72\n% in 2019.   The relative impact of McCormick de Mexico, S.A. de C.V. on income from unconsolidated operations in 2021 was impacted by the gain on our sale of an unconsolidated operation.\nSummarized annual and year-end information from the financial statements of unconsolidated affiliates representing\n100\n% of the businesses follows:\nRoyalty income from unconsolidated affiliates was $\n22.8\nmillion, $\n19.5\nmillion and $\n19.0\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSale of Unconsolidated Operation\nOn March 1, 2021, we sold our\n26\n% interest in Eastern Condiments Private Ltd (Eastern) for $\n65.4\nmillion in cash, net of transaction expenses of $\n1.4\nmillion. Eastern was accounted for as an equity method investment with our proportionate share of earnings, prior to the sale, reflected in Income from unconsolidated operations before income taxes in our consolidated income statement. The sale of Eastern resulted in a gain of $\n13.4\nmillion, net of tax of $\n5.7\nmillion. That gain is included in Income from unconsolidated operations before income taxes in our consolidated income statement. That gain also reflects a write-off of $\n1.4\nmillion of foreign currency translation adjustment, a component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss.\n70\n6.\nFINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nOur outstanding debt, including finance leases, was as follows at November 30:\n(1)\nInterest rate swaps, settled upon the issuance of these notes in 2013, effectively set the interest rate on the $\n250\nmillion notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of\n3.30\n%.\n(2)\nInterest rate swaps, settled upon the issuance of these notes in 2015, effectively set the interest rate on the $\n250\nmillion notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of\n3.45\n%\n.\nThe fixed interest rate on $\n100\nmillion of the\n3.25\n% notes due in 2025 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2025. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus\n1.22\n%. Our effective rate as of November 30, 2021 was\n1.38\n%.\n(3)\nInterest rate swaps, settled upon the issuance of these notes in 2017, effectively set the interest rate on the $\n750\nmillion notes at a weighted-average fixed rate of\n3.44\n%. The fixed interest rate on $\n250\nmillion of the\n3.40\n% notes due in 2027 is effectively converted to a variable rate by interest rate swaps through 2027. Net interest payments are based on 3-month LIBOR plus\n0.685\n%. Our effective rate as of November 30, 2021 was\n0.84\n%.\n(4)\nIncludes unamortized discounts, premiums and debt issuance costs of $(\n31.8\n) million and $(\n24.4\n) million as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Includes fair value adjustment associated with interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of $\n21.2\nmillion and $\n41.3\nmillion as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nMaturities of long-term debt, including finance leases, during the fiscal years subsequent to November 30, 2021 are as follows (in millions):\nIn February 2021, we issued $\n500.0\nmillion of\n0.90\n% notes due February 15, 2026, with cash proceeds received of $\n495.7\nmillion, net of discounts and underwriters' fees. Also in February 2021, we issued $\n500.0\nmillion of\n1.85\n% notes due February 15, 2031, with cash proceeds received of $\n492.8\nmillion, net of discounts and underwriters' fees. Interest is payable semiannually on both these notes in arrears in February and August of each year. The net proceeds from these issuances were used to pay down short-term borrowings, including a portion of the\n71\n$\n1,443.0\nmillion of commercial paper issued to finance our acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, and for general corporate purposes.\nIn April 2020, we issued $\n500.0\nmillion of\n2.50\n% notes due April 15, 2030, with cash proceeds received of $\n495.0\nmillion, net of discounts and underwriters' fees. Interest is payable semiannually in arrears in April and October of each year.\nWe have available credit facilities with domestic and foreign banks for various purposes. Some of these lines are committed lines and others are uncommitted lines and could be withdrawn at various times. In June 2021, we entered into a\nfive\n-year $\n1.5\nbillion revolving credit facility, which will expire in June 2026. The current pricing for the credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, is LIBOR plus\n1.25\n%. The pricing of the credit facility is based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to LIBOR plus\n1.75\n%. This credit facility supports our commercial paper program and, after $\n530.8\nmillion was used to support issued commercial paper, we have $\n969.2\nmillion of capacity at November 30, 2021. The provisions of this revolving credit facility restrict subsidiary indebtedness and require us to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio. As of November 30, 2021, our capacity under the\nfive\n-year $\n1.5\nbillion revolving credit facility was not affected by these covenants. We do not expect that these covenants would limit our access to our revolving credit facility for the foreseeable future. This facility replaced our prior revolving credit facilities which included: (i) a\nfive\n-year $\n1.0\nbillion revolving credit facility that was due to expire in August 2022, and (ii) a\n364\n-day $\n1.0\nbillion revolving facility, which we entered into in December 2020 and that was due to expire in December 2021.\nThe pricing for our prior five-year $\n1.0\nbillion revolving credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, was LIBOR plus\n1.25\n%. The pricing for our prior\n364\n-day $\n1.0\nbillion revolving credit facility, on a fully drawn basis, was LIBOR plus\n1.25\n%. The pricing of those credit facilities was based on a credit rating grid that contains a fully drawn maximum pricing of the credit facility equal to LIBOR plus\n1.75\n%. The provisions of our previous revolving credit facilities restricted subsidiary indebtedness and required us to maintain certain minimum and maximum financial ratios for interest expense coverage and our leverage ratio.\nIn addition, we have several uncommitted lines totaling $\n308.4\nmillion, which have a total unused capacity at November 30, 2021 of $\n226.6\nmillion. These lines, by their nature, can be withdrawn based on the lenders’ discretion. Committed credit facilities require a fee, and commitment fees were $\n2.0\nmillion, $\n1.3\nmillion and $\n1.3\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe entered into a Term Loan Agreement (Term Loan) in August 2017. The Term Loan provided for\nthree\n-year and\nfive\n-year senior unsecured term loans, each for $\n750\nmillion. The three-year loan was payable at maturity. The five-year loan was payable in equal quarterly installments in an amount of\n2.5\n% of the initial principal amount, with the remaining unpaid balance due at maturity. The three-year and five-year loans were each prepayable in whole or in part. In 2020, we repaid the five-year loan. Prior to payoff, the five-year loan bore interest at LIBOR plus\n1.25\n%. In 2019, we repaid the three-year loan. Prior to payoff, the three-year loan bore interest at LIBOR plus\n1.125\n%. The interest rates were based on our credit rating.\nAt November 30, 2021, we had guarantees outstanding of $\n0.6\nmillion with terms of one year or less. As of November 30, 2021 and 2020, we had outstanding letters of credit of $\n63.7\nmillion and $\n32.2\nmillion, respectively. These letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions. The unused portion of our letter of credit facility was $\n13.6\nmillion at November 30, 2021.\n7.\nLEASES\nOur lease portfolio primarily consists of (i) certain real estate, including those related to a number of administrative, distribution and manufacturing locations; (ii) certain machinery and equipment, including forklifts; and (iii) automobiles, delivery trucks and other vehicles, including an airplane. A limited number of our lease agreements include rental payments that are adjusted periodically based on a market rate or index. Our lease agreements generally do not contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants, with the exception of the non-cancellable synthetic lease discussed below.\nThe following presents the components of our lease expense for the years ended November 30 (in millions):\n72\nRental expense under operating leases (primarily buildings and equipment) was $\n48.1\nmillion in 2019.\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of November 30 were as follows (in millions):\nOur Corporate functions, Americas' leadership, and U.S. staff reside in our Hunt Valley, Maryland headquarters office building. The 15-year lease for that building requires monthly lease payments of approximately $\n0.9\nmillion which began in April 2019. The $\n0.9\nmillion monthly lease payment is subject to adjustment after an initial 60-month period and thereafter on an annual basis as specified in the lease agreement. We recognized this lease as a finance lease, with the leased asset of $\n107.4\nmillion and $\n116.1\nmillion included in property, plant and equipment, net, as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During each of the years ended November 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized amortization expense of $\n8.7\nmillion related to the leased asset. As of November 30, 2021, the total lease obligation associated with this building was $\n123.8\nmillion, of which $\n7.3\nmillion was included in the current portion of long-term debt and $\n116.5\nmillion was included in long-term debt. As of November 30, 2020, the total lease obligation was $\n130.9\nmillion, of which $\n7.1\nmillion was included in the current portion of long-term debt and $\n123.8\nmillion was included in long-term debt.\nInformation regarding our lease terms and discount rates as of November 30 were as follows:\n73\nThe future maturity of our lease liabilities as of November 30, 2021 were as follows (in millions):\nSupplemental cash flow and other information related to leases for the years ended November 30 were as follows (in millions):\nDuring October 2020, we entered into a non-cancellable synthetic lease for a distribution facility with an estimated construction cost of $\n315\nmillion. The lease will commence upon completion of construction of the facility, for which we are the construction agent, which is expected to be in the later part of fiscal 2022. The term of the lease is five years after commencement. The lease contains options to negotiate a renewal of the lease or to purchase or sell the facility at the end of the lease term. Upon lease commencement, the ROU asset and lease liability will be determined and recorded. The lease arrangement also contains a residual value guarantee of approximately\n75\n% of the total construction cost. The lease also contains covenants that are consistent with our $\n1.5\nbillion,\nfive\n-year revolving credit agreement as disclosed in note 6.\n8.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nWe use derivative financial instruments to enhance our ability to manage risk, including foreign currency and interest rate exposures, which exist as part of our ongoing business operations. We do not enter into contracts for trading purposes, nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instrument and all derivatives are designated as hedges. We are not a party to master netting arrangements, and we do not offset the fair value of derivative contracts with the same counterparty in our financial statement disclosures. The use of derivative financial instruments is monitored through regular communication with senior management and the use of written guidelines.\nForeign Currency\nWe are potentially exposed to foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments in subsidiaries, transactions (both third-party and intercompany) and earnings denominated in foreign currencies. Management assesses foreign currency risk based on transactional cash flows and translational volatility and may enter into forward contract and currency swaps with highly-rated financial institutions to reduce fluctuations in the long or short currency positions.  Forward contracts are generally less than\n18\nmonths duration. Currency swap agreements are established in conjunction with the terms of the underlying debt issues.\nAt November 30, 2021, we had foreign currency exchange contracts to purchase or sell $\n583.6\nmillion of foreign currencies as compared to $\n383.8\nmillion at November 30, 2020. All of these contracts were designated as hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency or hedges of foreign currency denominated assets or liabilities. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material. All foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding at November\n74\n30, 2021 have durations of less than\n18\nmonths, including $\n209.7\nmillion of notional contracts that have durations of less than one month and are used to hedge short-term cash flow funding.\nContracts which are designated as hedges of anticipated purchases denominated in a foreign currency (generally purchases of raw materials in U.S. dollars by operating units outside the U.S.) are considered cash flow hedges. The gains and losses on these contracts are deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in cost of goods sold, at which time the net amount deferred in accumulated other comprehensive income is also recognized in cost of goods sold. Gains and losses from contracts that are designated as hedges of assets, liabilities or firm commitments are recognized through income, offsetting the change in fair value of the hedged item.\nWe also enter into fair value foreign currency exchange contracts to manage exposure to currency fluctuations in certain intercompany loans between subsidiaries as well as currency exposure to third-party non-functional currency assets or liabilities. The notional value of these contracts was $\n449.3\nmillion and $\n212.3\nmillion at November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Any gains or losses recorded based on both the change in fair value of these contracts and the change in the currency component of the underlying loans are recognized in our consolidated income statement as other income, net.\nWe also utilize cross currency interest rate swap contracts that are designated as net investment hedges. As of November 30, 2021 and 2020, we had cross currency interest rate swap contracts of (i) $\n250\nmillion notional value to receive $\n250\nmillion at three-month U.S. LIBOR plus\n0.685\n% and pay £\n194.1\nmillion at three-month GBP LIBOR plus\n0.740\n% and (ii) £\n194.1\nmillion notional value to receive £\n194.1\nmillion at three-month GBP LIBOR plus\n0.740\n% and pay €\n221.8\nmillion at three-month Euro EURIBOR plus\n0.808\n%. These cross-currency interest rate swap contracts expire in August 2027.\nInterest Rates\nWe finance a portion of our operations with both fixed and variable rate debt instruments, primarily commercial paper, notes and bank loans. We utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize worldwide financing costs and to achieve a desired mix of variable and fixed rate debt.\nAs of November 30, 2021 and 2020, we have outstanding interest rate swap contracts for a notional amount of $\n350.0\nmillion. Those interest rate swap contracts include a $\n100\nmillion notional value of interest rate swap contracts where we receive interest at\n3.25\n% and pay a variable rate of interest based on three-month LIBOR plus\n1.22\n%. These swaps, which expire in November 2025, are designated as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of $\n100\nmillion of the $\n250\nmillion\n3.25\n% medium-term notes due 2025. We also have $\n250\nmillion notional interest rate swap contracts where we receive interest at\n3.40\n% and pay a variable rate of interest based on three-month LIBOR plus\n0.685\n%, which expire in August 2027, and are designated as fair value hedges of the changes in fair value of $\n250\nmillion of the $\n750\nmillion\n3.40\n% term notes due 2027.\nAny unrealized gain or loss on these swaps was offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in the value of the hedged debt. Hedge ineffectiveness was not material.\n75\nThe following tables disclose the notional amount and fair values of derivative instruments on our consolidated balance sheet:\nThe following tables disclose the impact of derivative instruments on other comprehensive income (OCI), accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) and our consolidated income statement for the years ended November 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nThe amount of gain or loss recognized in income on the ineffective portion of derivative instruments is not material. The net amount of accumulated other comprehensive income expected to be reclassified into income related to\n76\nthese contracts in the next twelve months is a $\n0.2\nmillion decrease to earnings.\nFor all net investment hedges, no amounts have been reclassified out of other comprehensive income (loss). The amounts noted in the tables above for OCI do not include any adjustments for the impact of deferred income taxes.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nWe are potentially exposed to concentrations of credit risk with trade accounts receivable and financial instruments. The customers of our consumer segment are predominantly food retailers and food wholesalers. Consolidations in these industries have created larger customers. In addition, competition has increased with the growth in alternative channels including mass merchandisers, dollar stores, warehouse clubs, discount chains and e-commerce. This has caused some customers to be less profitable and increased our exposure to credit risk. We generally have a large and diverse customer base which limits our concentration of credit risk. At November 30, 2021, we did not have amounts due from any single customer that exceed\n10\n% of consolidated trade accounts receivable. Current credit markets are highly volatile and some of our customers and counterparties are highly leveraged. We continue to closely monitor the credit worthiness of our customers and counterparties and generally do not require collateral. We believe that the allowance for doubtful accounts properly recognized trade receivables at realizable value. We consider nonperformance credit risk for other financial instruments to be insignificant.\n9.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value can be measured using valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). Accounting standards utilize a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\n•\nLevel 1:\nObservable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2:\nInputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n•\nLevel 3:\nUnobservable inputs that reflect management’s own assumptions.\n77\nOur population of assets and liabilities subject to fair value measurements on a recurring basis are as follows:\nAt November 30, 2021 and 2020, we had no financial assets or liabilities that were subject to a level 3 fair value measurement.\nAt November 30, 2021 and 2020, the carrying amount of interest rate derivatives, foreign currency derivatives, cross currency contracts, insurance contracts, and bond and other long-term investments are equal to their respective fair values. Because of their short-term nature, the amounts reported in the balance sheet for cash and cash equivalents, receivables, short-term borrowings and trade accounts payable approximate fair value. Investments in affiliates are not readily marketable, and it is not practicable to estimate their fair value.\nInsurance contracts, bonds, and other long-term investments are comprised of fixed income and equity securities held for certain non-qualified U.S. employee benefit plans and are stated at fair value on the balance sheet. The fair values of insurance contracts are based upon the underlying values of the securities in which they are invested and are from quoted market prices from various stock and bond exchanges for similar type assets. The fair values of bonds and other long-term investments are based on quoted market prices from various stock and bond exchanges. The fair values for interest rate derivatives, foreign currency derivatives, and cross currency contracts are based on values for similar instruments using models with market-based inputs.\n78\nThe carrying amount and fair value of long-term debt, including the current portion, as of November 30 were as follows:\nThe fair value for Level 2 long-term debt is determined by using quoted prices for similar debt instruments.\n10\n.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe following table sets forth the components of accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax where applicable, as of November 30 (in millions):\n(1)\nDuring the year ended November 30, 2021, the foreign currency translation adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by $(\n59.3\n) million, including the impact of a $\n15.5\nmillion decrease associated with net investment hedges. During the year ended November 30, 2020, the foreign currency translation adjustment of accumulated other comprehensive loss decreased by $\n92.5\nmillion, including the impact of a $\n20.8\nmillion increase associated with net investment hedges. These net investment hedges are more fully described in note 8.\nThe following table sets forth the amounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) and into consolidated net income for the years ended November 30:\n(1)\nThis accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) component is included in the computation of total pension expense and total other postretirement expense (refer to note 11 for additional details).\n11.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND RETIREMENT PLANS\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and certain foreign locations. In addition, we sponsor defined contribution plans in the U.S. We contribute to defined contribution plans in locations outside the U.S., including government-sponsored retirement plans. We also currently provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. employees and retirees.\nDuring fiscal year 2017, we made significant changes to certain of our employee benefit plans and retirements plans that froze the accrual of certain defined benefit pension plans in the U.S. and the United Kingdom with effective dates of the plan being frozen occurring between December 31, 2016 and November 30, 2018.\nAlso, on December\n79\n1, 2017, the freezing of benefits under our pension plans in Canada was approved with an effective date of November 30, 2019. Although those plans have been frozen, employees who are participants in the plans retained benefits accumulated up to the date of the freeze, based on credited service and eligible earnings, in accordance with the terms of the plans.\nIncluded in our consolidated balance sheet as of November 30, 2021 on the line entitled \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" was $\n248.7\nmillion ($\n193.6\nmillion net of tax) related to net unrecognized actuarial losses that have not yet been recognized in net periodic pension or postretirement benefit cost. We expect to recognize $\n10.0\nmillion ($\n7.3\nmillion net of tax) in net periodic pension and postretirement benefit costs during 2022 related to the amortization of actuarial losses of $\n9.7\nmillion and the amortization of prior service cost of $\n0.3\nmillion.\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe significant assumptions used to determine benefit obligations are as follows as of November 30:\nThe significant assumptions used to determine pension expense for the years ended November 30 are as follows:\nAnnually, we undertake a process, with the assistance of our external investment consultants, to evaluate the appropriate projected rates of return to use for our pension plans’ assumptions. We engage our investment consultants' research teams to develop capital market assumptions for each asset category in our plans to project investment returns into the future. The specific methods used to develop expected return assumptions vary by asset category. We adjust the outcomes for the fact that plan assets are invested with actively managed funds and subject to tactical asset reallocation.\nOur pension expense (income) for the years ended November 30 was as follows:\n80\nA rollforward of the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and a reconciliation of the pension plans’ funded status as of November 30, the measurement date, follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation is the present value of pension benefits (whether vested or unvested) attributed to employee service rendered before the measurement date and based on employee service and compensation prior to that date. The accumulated benefit obligation differs from the projected benefit obligation in that it includes no assumption about future compensation or service levels. The accumulated benefit obligation for the U.S. pension plans was $\n912.3\nmillion and $\n945.1\nmillion as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for the international pension plans was $\n351.3\nmillion and $\n367.9\nmillion as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIncluded in the U.S. in the preceding table is a benefit obligation of $\n104.2\nmillion and $\n110.5\nmillion for 2021 and 2020, respectively, related to our Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (SERP). The assets related to this plan, which totaled $\n90.3\nmillion and $\n86.4\nmillion as of November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are held in a rabbi trust and accordingly have not been included in the preceding table.\nAmounts recorded in the balance sheet for all defined benefit pension plans as of November 30 consist of the following:\n81\nThe investment objectives of the defined benefit pension plans are to provide assets to meet the current and future obligations of the plans at a reasonable cost to us. The goal is to optimize the long-term return across the portfolio of investments at a moderate level of risk. Higher-returning assets include mutual, co-mingled and other funds comprised of equity securities, utilizing both active and passive investment styles. These more volatile assets are balanced with less volatile assets, primarily mutual, co-mingled and other funds comprised of fixed income securities. Professional investment firms are engaged to provide advice on the selection and monitoring of investment funds, and to provide advice on the allocation of plan assets across the various fund managers. This advice is based in part on the duration of each plan’s liability. The investment return performances are evaluated quarterly against specific benchmark indices and against a peer group of funds of the same asset classification.\nThe allocations of U.S. pension plan assets as of November 30, by asset category, were as follows:\nThe allocations of the international pension plans’ assets as of November 30, by asset category, were as follows:\n82\nThe following tables set forth by level, within the fair value hierarchy as described in note 9, pension plan assets at their fair value as of November 30 for the United States and international plans:\n83\n(a)\nThis category comprises equity funds and collective equity trust funds that most closely track the S&P index and other equity indices.\n(b)\nThis category comprises international equity funds with varying benchmark indices.\n(c)\nThis category comprises funds consisting of U.S. government and U.S. corporate bonds and other fixed income securities. An appropriate benchmark is the Barclays Capital Aggregate Bond Index.\n(d)\nThis category comprises funds consisting of real estate related debt securities with an appropriate benchmark of the Barclays Investment Grade CMBS Index.\n(e)\nThis category comprises funds consisting of international government/corporate bonds and other fixed income securities with varying benchmark indices.\n(f)\nThis category comprises insurance contracts, the majority of which have a guaranteed investment return.\n(g)\nThis category comprises funds investing in real estate investment trusts (REIT). An appropriate benchmark is the MSCI U.S. REIT Index.\n(h)\nThis category comprises funds investing in natural resources. An appropriate benchmark is the Alerian master limited partnership (MLP) Index.\n(i)\nCertain investments that are valued using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy. These are included to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the aggregate pension plan assets.\n(j)\nThis category comprises hedge funds investing in strategies represented in various HFRI Fund Indices. The net asset value is generally based on the valuation of the underlying investment. Limitations exist on the timing from notice by the plan of its intent to redeem and actual redemptions of these funds and generally range from a minimum of one month to several months.\n(k)\nThis category comprises private equity, venture capital and limited partnerships. The net asset is based on valuation models of the underlying securities as determined by the general partner or general partner's designee. These valuation models include unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have redemption periods of approximately 10 years.\n(l)\nThis category comprises limited partnerships funds investing in senior loans, mezzanine and distressed debt. The net asset is based on valuation models of the underlying securities as determined by the general partner or general partner's designee. These valuation models include unobservable inputs that cannot be corroborated using verifiable observable market data. These funds typically have redemption periods of approximately 10 years.\nFor the plans’ hedge funds, private equity funds and private debt funds, we engage an independent advisor to compare the funds’ returns to other funds with similar strategies. Each fund is required to have an annual audit by an independent accountant, which is provided to the independent advisor. This provides a basis of comparability relative to similar assets.\nEquity securities in the U.S. pension plans included McCormick stock with a fair value of $\n47.7\nmillion (\n0.6\nmillion shares and\n6.3\n% of total U.S. pension plan assets) and $\n50.6\nmillion (\n0.6\nmillion shares and\n7.4\n% of total U.S. pension plan assets) at November 30, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Dividends paid on these shares were $\n0.7\nmillion and $\n0.9\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nPension benefit payments in our most significant plans are made from assets of the pension plans. It is anticipated that future benefit payments for the U.S. and international plans for the next 10 fiscal years will be as follows:\nU.S. Defined Contribution Retirement Plans\nFor our U.S. qualified and non-qualified defined contribution retirement plans, we match\n100\n% of a participant’s contribution up to the first\n3\n% of the participant’s salary, and\n66.7\n% of the next\n3\n% of the participant’s salary. In addition, we make contributions of\n3\n% of the participant's salary for all U.S. employees who are employed on December 31 of each year. Some of our smaller subsidiaries sponsor separate 401(k) retirement plans. Our contributions charged to expense under all U.S. defined contribution retirement plans were $\n29.8\nmillion, $\n30.8\nmillion and $\n28.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n84\nAt the participants' election, 401(k) retirement plans held\n2.8\nmillion shares of McCormick stock, with a fair value of $\n238.9\nmillion, at November 30, 2021. Dividends paid on the shares held in the 401(k) retirement plans in 2021 and 2020 were $\n3.9\nmillion and $\n3.8\nmillion, respectively, in each year.\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\nWe currently provide postretirement medical and life insurance benefits to certain U.S. employees who were covered under the active employees’ plan and retire after age\n55\nwith at least\nfive years\nof service. The subsidy provided under these plans is based primarily on age at date of retirement. These benefits are not pre-funded but paid as incurred. Employees hired after December 31, 2008 are not eligible for a company subsidy. They are eligible for coverage on an access-only basis.\nOur other postretirement benefit expense (income) for the years ended November 30 follows:\nRollforwards of the benefit obligation, fair value of plan assets and a reconciliation of the plans’ funded status at November 30, the measurement date, follow:\nEstimated future benefit payments (net of employee contributions) for the next 10 fiscal years are as follows:\nThe assumed discount rate in determining the benefit obligation was\n2.7\n% and\n2.3\n% for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFor 2021, the assumed annual rate of increase in the cost of covered health care benefits is\n6.3\n% (\n6.8\n% last year). It is assumed to decrease gradually to\n4.5\n% in the year 2032 (\n4.5\n% in 2032 last year) and remain at that level thereafter. A one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have had an immaterial effect on the benefit obligation and the total of service and interest cost components for 2021.\n85\n12.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have\nfour\ntypes of stock-based compensation awards: restricted stock units (RSUs), stock options, company stock awarded as part of our long-term performance plan (LTPP), and beginning in 2020, price-vested stock options. Total stock-based compensation expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n66.6\nmillion, $\n46.0\nmillion and $\n37.2\nmillion, respectively. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to our RSUs and stock options at November 30, 2021 was $\n19.7\nmillion and the weighted-average period over which this will be recognized is\n1.3\nyears. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to our price-vested stock options at November 30, 2021 was $\n13.5\nmillion and the weighted-average period over which this will be recognized is\n2.0\nyears. Total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense related to our LTPP is variable in nature and is dependent on the company's execution against established performance metrics under performance cycles related to this plan.  As of November 30, 2021, we have\n5.5\nmillion shares remaining available for future issuance under our RSUs, stock option and LTPP award programs.\nThe following summarizes the key terms, a summary of activity, and the methods of valuation for each of our stock-based compensation awards.\nRSUs\nRSUs are valued at the market price of the underlying stock, discounted by foregone dividends, on the date of grant. Substantially all of the RSUs granted vest over a three-year term or, if earlier, upon the retirement eligibility\ndate of the holder.\nA summary of our RSU activity for the years ended November 30 follows:\nStock Options (Other than Price-Vested Stock Options)\nStock options are granted with an exercise price equal to the market price of the stock on the date of grant. Substantially all of the options, with the exception of price-vested options detailed below, vest ratably over a three-year period or, if earlier, upon the retirement-eligibility dates of the holders and are exercisable over a\n10\n-year period. Upon exercise of the option, shares are issued from our authorized and unissued shares.\nThe fair value of the options is estimated with a lattice option pricing model which uses the assumptions in the following table. We believe the lattice model provides an appropriate estimate of fair value of our options as it allows for a range of possible outcomes over an option term and can be adjusted for changes in certain assumptions over time. Expected volatilities are based primarily on the historical performance of our stock. We also use historical data to estimate the timing and amount of option exercises and forfeitures within the valuation model. The expected term of the options is an output of the option pricing model and estimates the period of time that options are expected to remain unexercised. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant. Compensation expense is calculated based on the fair value of the options on the date of grant.\nThe per share weighted-average fair value for all options granted was $\n18.36\n, $\n13.27\nand $\n13.76\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThese fair values were computed using the following range of assumptions for the years ended November 30:\nUnder our stock option plans, we may issue shares on a net basis at the request of the option holder. This occurs by netting the option cost in shares from the shares exercised.\n86\nA summary of our stock option activity for the years ended November 30 follows:\nAs of November 30, 2021, the intrinsic value (the difference between the exercise price and the market price) for all options currently outstanding was $\n133.3\nmillion and for options currently exercisable was $\n124.9\nmillion. At November 30, 2021, the differences between options outstanding and options expected to vest and their related weighted-average exercise prices, aggregate intrinsic values and weighted-average remaining lives were not material. The total intrinsic value of all options exercised during the years ended November 30, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n10.7\nmillion, $\n68.4\nmillion and $\n111.0\nmillion, respectively.\nA summary of our stock options outstanding and exercisable at November 30, 2021 follows:\nPrice-Vested Stock Options\nIn November 2020, we granted approximately\n2,482,000\nprice-vested stock options to certain employees. The price-vested stock options were granted with an exercise price of $\n93.49\nwhich was equal to the market price of our stock on the date of grant. The price-vested options are not exercisable until a three year service condition is achieved, and will become exercisable after that time period only if the average closing price of our stock price equals or exceeds thresholds of\n60\n%,\n80\n% or\n100\n% appreciation from the exercise price for 30 consecutive trading days within a five-year period from the date of grant. If the options become exercisable, they are exercisable up to\n10\nyears from the date of grant. The options granted were divided equally between the three appreciation thresholds. Employees who are retirement eligible vest on a pro-rata basis over a three-year period if the market condition is met in the five-year period from the date of grant. If the market conditions are not met in the five-year period from the date of grant, the options do not become exercisable and will be forfeited.\nThe fair value of the price-vested options was estimated using a lattice model.\nThe per share weighted-average fair value for the price-vested stock options granted was $\n11.88\n, $\n9.26\n, and $\n7.05\n, for the\n60\n%,\n80\n% and\n100\n% appreciation thresholds, respectively.\nThese fair values were computed using the following range of assumptions:\n87\nThe following is a summary of our Price-Vested Stock Options activity for the year ended November 30, 2021:\nAs of November 30, 2021 and 2020, the outstanding options are divided equally between the three appreciation thresholds.\nLTPP\nLTPP awards granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 will be delivered in company stock, with the award attainment calculated as a percentage of target based on a combination of a performance-based component and a market-based total shareholder return. These awards are valued based on the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant.\nA summary of the LTPP award activity for the years ended November 30 follows:\n88\n13.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended November 30 consists of the following:\nThe components of income from consolidated operations before income taxes for the years ended November 30 follow:\nA reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory rate with the effective tax rate for the years ended November 30 follows:\n89\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following as of November 30:\nAt November 30, 2021, we have tax loss carryforwards of $\n186.2\nmillion. Of these carryforwards, $\n1.1\nmillion expire in 2022, $\n18.7\nmillion from 2023 through 2024, $\n88.0\nmillion from 2025 through 2038 and $\n78.4\nmillion may be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, one of our non-U.S. subsidiaries has a capital loss carryforward of $\n5.0\nmillion which may be carried forward indefinitely. At November 30, 2021, we also have U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n7.0\nmillion and $\n5.3\nmillion which expire in 2030 and 2031, respectively.\nA valuation allowance has been provided to cover deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not realizable. The net increase of $\n1.2\nmillion in the valuation allowance from November 30, 2020 to November 30, 2021 resulted primarily from the net increase of valuation allowances for net operating losses and other tax attributes in the U.S. and certain non-U.S. jurisdictions.\nIn December 2017, \"An Act to provide for reconciliation pursuant to titles II and V of the concurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2018\" was enacted into law as Pub. L. 115-9 (hereafter referred to as the \"U.S. Tax Act\"). Prior to the U.S. Tax Act, we asserted that substantially all of the undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries and joint ventures were considered indefinitely invested and accordingly, no deferred taxes were provided. Pursuant to the provisions of the U.S. Tax Act, these earnings were subjected to a one-time transition tax in 2018. The transition tax was recognized in 2018 and was based on cumulative earnings prior to the U.S. Tax Act.  Our intent is to continue to reinvest undistributed earnings of our international subsidiaries and joint ventures indefinitely. As of November 30, 2021, we have $\n1.3\nbillion of earnings that are considered indefinitely reinvested. While federal income tax expense has been recognized as a result of the U.S. Tax Act, we have not provided any additional deferred taxes with respect to items such as foreign withholding taxes, state income tax or foreign exchange gain or loss. It is not practicable for us to determine the amount of unrecognized tax expense on these reinvested international earnings.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our gross unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended November 30:\nAs of November 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, if recognized, $\n26.8\nmillion, $\n39.3\nmillion and $\n32.0\nmillion, respectively, of the unrecognized tax benefits would affect the effective rate.\nWe record interest and penalties on income taxes in income tax expense. We recognized interest and penalty expense (benefit) of $(\n3.7\n) million, $\n0.8\nmillion and $\n2.1\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of\n90\nNovember 30, 2021 and 2020, we had accrued $\n4.7\nmillion and $\n8.3\nmillion, respectively, of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits.\nTax settlements or statute of limitation expirations could result in a change to our uncertain tax positions.  We believe that the reasonably possible total amount of unrecognized tax benefits as of November 30, 2021 that could decrease in the next 12 months as a result of various statute expirations, audit closures and/or tax settlements would not be material.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and non-U.S. jurisdictions. The open years subject to tax audits vary depending on the tax jurisdictions. In the U.S federal jurisdiction, we are no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 2018. In other major jurisdictions, we are no longer subject to income tax audits by taxing authorities for years before 2014.\nWe are under normal recurring tax audits in the U.S. and in several jurisdictions outside the U.S. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular uncertain tax position, we believe that our reserves for uncertain tax positions are adequate to cover existing risks and exposures.\n14.  CAPITAL STOCK AND\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nOn April 5, 2021, following approval by the Company’s shareholders on March 31, 2021, amendments to the Company’s Charter became effective that increased the number of authorized shares of each class of common stock from\n320,000,000\nto\n640,000,000\nand established the par value of each class of common stock at $\n0.01\nper share. The par value and additional paid in capital associated with each class of common stock is recorded in Common stock and Common stock non-voting in our consolidated balance sheet.\nHolders of Common Stock have full voting rights except that (1) the voting rights of persons who are deemed to own beneficially 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Common Stock are limited to\n10\n% of the votes entitled to be cast by all holders of shares of Common Stock regardless of how many shares in excess of 10% are held by such person; (2) we have the right to redeem any or all shares of Common Stock owned by such person unless such person acquires more than\n90\n% of the outstanding shares of each class of our common stock; and (3) at such time as such person controls more than\n50\n% of the votes entitled to be cast by the holders of outstanding shares of Common Stock, automatically, on a share-for-share basis, all shares of Common Stock Non-Voting will convert into shares of Common Stock.\nHolders of Common Stock Non-Voting will vote as a separate class on all matters on which they are entitled to vote. Holders of Common Stock Non-Voting are entitled to vote on reverse mergers and statutory share exchanges where our capital stock is converted into other securities or property, dissolution of the company and the sale of substantially all of our assets, as well as forward mergers and consolidation of the company or any amendment to our charter repealing the right of the Common Stock Non-Voting to vote on any such matters.\nThe reconciliation of shares outstanding used in the calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended November 30 follows:\nThe following table sets forth the stock options and RSUs for the years ended November 30 which were not considered in our earnings per share calculation since they were antidilutive:\n15.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nDuring the normal course of our business, we are occasionally involved with various claims and litigation. Reserves are established in connection with such matters when a loss is probable and the amount of such loss can be reasonably estimated. At November 30, 2021 and 2020, no material reserves were recorded. The determination of probability and the estimation of the actual amount of any such loss are inherently unpredictable, and it is therefore possible that the eventual outcome of such claims and litigation could exceed the estimated reserves, if any.\n91\nHowever, we do not expect the outcome of the matters currently pending will have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.\n16.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS\nBusiness Segments\nWe operate in two business segments: consumer and flavor solutions. The consumer and flavor solutions segments manufacture, market and distribute spices, seasoning mixes, condiments and other flavorful products throughout the world. Our consumer segment sells to retail channels, including grocery, mass merchandise, warehouse clubs, discount and drug stores, and e-commerce under the “McCormick” brand and a variety of brands around the world, including “French's,” “Frank's RedHot,” “Lawry’s,” “Zatarain’s,” “Simply Asia,” “Thai Kitchen,” “Ducros,” “Vahiné,” \"Cholula,\" “Schwartz,” “Club House,” “Kamis,” \"DaQiao,\" \"Drogheria & Alimentari,\" \"Stubb's,\" \"OLD BAY\" and \"Gourmet Garden.\" Our flavor solutions segment sells to food manufacturers and the foodservice industry both directly and indirectly through distributors, with the exception of our businesses in China and India, where foodservice sales are managed by and reported in our consumer segment.\nIn each of our segments, we produce and sell many individual products which are similar in composition and nature. With their primary attribute being flavor, the products within each of our segments are regarded as fairly homogenous. It is impracticable to segregate and identify sales and profits for each of these individual product lines.\nWe measure segment performance based on operating income excluding special charges as this activity is managed separately from the business segments. We also excluded transaction and integration expenses related to our acquisitions, including the recent acquisitions of Cholula and FONA, from our measure of segment performance as these expenses are similarly managed separately from the business segments. These transaction and integration expenses excluded from our segment performance measure include the amortization of the acquisition-date fair value adjustment of inventories that is included in cost of goods sold, costs directly associated with that acquisition and costs associated with integrating the businesses. Although the segments are managed separately due to their distinct distribution channels and marketing strategies, manufacturing and warehousing are often integrated to maximize cost efficiencies. We do not segregate jointly utilized assets by individual segment for purposes of internal reporting, performance evaluation, or capital allocation.\nWe have a large number of customers for our products. Sales to one of our consumer segment customers, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., accounted for approximately\n11\n%,\n12\n% and\n11\n% of consolidated sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Sales to one of our flavor solutions segment customers, PepsiCo, Inc., accounted for approximately\n11\n%,\n11\n%, and\n10\n% of consolidated sales in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nAccounting policies for measuring segment operating income and assets are consistent with those described in note 1. Because of integrated manufacturing for certain products within the segments, products are not sold from one segment to another but rather inventory is transferred at cost. Inter-segment sales are not material. Corporate assets include cash, deferred taxes, investments and certain fixed assets.\n92\nBusiness Segment Results\nA reconciliation of operating income excluding special charges and, for 2021 and 2020, transaction and integration expenses, to operating income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n93\nGeographic Areas\nWe have net sales and long-lived assets in the following geographic areas:\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization.\n94\n17.\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL STATEMENT DATA\nSupplemental consolidated information with respect to our income statement, balance sheet and cash flow follow:\nDividends paid per share were $\n1.36\nin 2021, $\n1.24\nin 2020 and $\n1.14\nin 2019. Dividends declared per share were $\n1.39\nin 2021, $\n1.27\nin 2020, and $\n1.17\nin 2019.\n95"
