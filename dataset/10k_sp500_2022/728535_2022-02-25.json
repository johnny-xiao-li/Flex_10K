    "text": "OVERVIEW\nWe are one of the largest surface transportation, delivery, and logistics companies in North America. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is a publicly held holding company that, together with our wholly owned subsidiaries, provides safe and reliable transportation and delivery services to a diverse group of customers and consumers throughout the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our,” the “Company”, and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. We were incorporated in Arkansas on August 10, 1961, and have been a publicly held company since our initial public offering in 1983. Our service offerings include transportation of full-truckload containerized freight, which we directly transport utilizing our company-controlled revenue equipment and company drivers or independent contractors. We have arrangements with most of the major North American rail carriers to transport freight in containers or trailers, while we perform the majority of the pickup and delivery services. We also provide customized freight movement, revenue equipment, labor, systems, and delivery services that are tailored to meet individual customers’ requirements and typically involve long-term contracts. These arrangements are generally referred to as dedicated services and may include multiple pickups and drops, freight handling, specialized equipment, and freight network design. In addition, we provide local and home delivery services, generally referred to as final-mile delivery services, to customers through a network of cross-dock and other delivery system locations throughout the continental United States. Utilizing a network of thousands of reliable third-party carriers, we also provide comprehensive transportation and logistics services. In addition to dry-van, full-load operations, these unrelated outside carriers also provide flatbed, refrigerated, less-than-truckload (LTL), and other specialized equipment, drivers, and services. Also, we utilize a combination of company-owned and contracted power units to provide traditional over-the-road full truckload delivery services. Our customers, who include many Fortune 500 companies, have extremely diverse businesses. Many of them are served by J.B. Hunt 360°®, an online platform that offers shippers and carriers greater access, visibility and transparency of the supply chain.\n2\nWe believe our ability to offer multiple services, utilizing our five business segments and a full complement of logistics services through third parties, represents a competitive advantage. These segments include Intermodal (JBI), Dedicated Contract Services® (DCS®), Integrated Capacity Solutions (ICS), Final Mile Services® (FMS) and Truckload (JBT). Our business usually involves slightly higher freight volumes in August through early November. Meanwhile, DCS and FMS are subject to less seasonal variation than our other segments.\nOur operations continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 global pandemic. Due to the nature of our business and the large portion of our workforce consisting of drivers and other non-office personnel, fewer than 25% of our total employees have been able to work remotely; however, we remain committed to the safety of our workforce, suppliers, and customers while continuing to meet our customers’ needs. In the first quarter 2020, we began our COVID-19 response activities which have been expanded and will continue as necessary until the risks related to COVID-19 dissipate. Our COVID-19 safety response activities at our home office campus and all other field locations throughout North America include requiring remote working when possible, expanded health and safety policies, facility modifications, increased security coverage, and purchase and distribution of personal protective equipment and supplies. During 2021, we committed to providing incremental paid time off for employees to help offset any financial loss caused by their absence from work when receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. We also continue to work with local healthcare organizations to provide vaccination assistance under applicable area guidelines and procedures to employees and their family members. We continue to review and analyze both external and internal COVID-related data, including the effects of new variants, on a daily basis. We have been pleased with the continued performance of our employees, particularly our drivers, who have provided consistent service to our customers throughout the pandemic.\nAdditional general information about us is available at jbhunt.com. We make a number of reports and other information available free of charge on our website, including our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and all amendments to those reports as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is electronically filed with or furnished to the SEC pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Our website also contains corporate governance guidelines, our code of ethics, our whistleblower policy, Board committee charters, and other corporate policies. The information on our website is not, and shall not be deemed to be, a part of this annual report on Form 10-K or incorporated into any other filings we make with the SEC.\nOUR MISSION AND STRATEGY\nOur Mission: To create the most efficient transportation network in North America.\nWe forge long-term relationships with key customers that include supply chain management as an integral part of their strategies. Working in concert, we strive to drive out excess cost, add value and function as an extension of their enterprises. Our strategy is based on utilizing an integrated, multimodal approach to provide capacity-oriented solutions centered on delivering customer value and industry-leading service. We believe our unique operating strategy can add value to customers and increase our profits and returns to stockholders.\n3\nWe continually analyze opportunities for additional capital investment and where management’s resources should be focused to provide more benefits to our customers. These actions should, in turn, yield increasing returns to our stockholders.\nIncreasingly, our customers are seeking energy-efficient transportation solutions to reduce both cost and greenhouse-gas emissions. Our Company’s mission, to create the most efficient transportation network in North America, focuses on delivering both for our customers across all of our business segments. We seek to accomplish this by maintaining a modern fleet to maximize fuel efficiency, converting loads from truck to rail with our intermodal service, and introducing technologies to optimize freight flows in the supply chain by eliminating waste. Additionally, we continue to test and explore the usage of alternative fuel vehicles. Efforts to improve fleet fuel efficiency and reduce greenhouse gas emissions are ongoing. We are an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) SmartWay® Transport Partner, and proud to have been awarded the EPA’s SmartWay® Excellence Award each of the last twelve years.\nAs always, we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all of our operations as safely as possible.\nOPERATING SEGMENTS\nSegment information is also included in Note 14 to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nJBI Segment\nThe transportation service offerings of our JBI segment utilize arrangements with most major North American rail carriers to provide intermodal freight solutions for our customers throughout the continental United States, Canada, and Mexico. Our JBI segment began operations in 1989, forming a unique partnership with what is now the BNSF Railway Company (BNSF); this was a watershed event in the industry and the first agreement that linked major rail and truckload carriers in a joint service environment. Throughout the years that followed, JBI established multiple agreements with other Class I railroads. JBI draws on the intermodal services of these rail carriers for the underlying linehaul movement of its equipment between rail ramps. The origin and destination pickup and delivery services (drayage) are handled by our company-owned tractors for the majority of our intermodal loads, while third-party dray carriers are used where economical. By performing our own drayage services, we are able to provide a cost-competitive, seamless coordination of the combined rail and dray movements for our customers.\nJBI operates 104,973 pieces of company-owned trailing equipment systemwide. The fleet primarily consists of 53-foot, high-cube containers and is designed to take advantage of intermodal double-stack economics and superior ride quality. We own and maintain our own chassis fleet, consisting of 85,649 units. The containers and chassis are uniquely designed so that they may only be paired together, which we feel creates an operational competitive advantage. JBI also manages a fleet of 5,612 company-owned tractors, 582 independent contractor trucks, and 6,943 company drivers. At December 31, 2021, the total JBI employee count was 7,940. Revenue for the JBI segment in 2021 was $5.45 billion.\nDCS Segment\nDCS focuses on private fleet conversion and creation in replenishment and specialized equipment. We specialize in the design, development, and execution of supply chain solutions that support a variety of transportation networks. Contracts with our customers are long-term, ranging from three to 10 years, with the average being approximately five years. Pricing of our contracts typically involves cost-plus arrangements, with our fixed costs being recovered regardless of equipment utilization, but is customized based on invested capital and duration.\nAt December 31, 2021, this segment operated 11,139 company-owned trucks, 544 customer-owned trucks, and 6 independent contractor trucks. DCS also operates 21,069 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 7,753 customer-owned trailers. The DCS segment employed 14,709 people, including 12,632 drivers, at December 31, 2021. DCS revenue for 2021 was $2.58 billion.\n4\nICS Segment\nICS provides traditional freight brokerage and transportation logistics solutions to customers through relationships with thousands of third-party carriers and integration with our owned equipment within other segments. By leveraging the J.B. Hunt brand, systems, and network, we provide a broader service offering to customers by providing flatbed, refrigerated, expedited, and LTL, as well as a variety of dry-van and intermodal solutions. Furthermore, we offer an online multimodal marketplace via J.B. Hunt 360 that matches the right load with the right carrier and the best mode. ICS also provides single-source logistics management for customers desiring to outsource their transportation functions and utilize our proven supply chain technology and design expertise to improve efficiency. ICS operates multiple remote sales offices or branches, as well as on-site logistics personnel working in direct contact with customers.\nAt December 31, 2021, the ICS segment employed 975 people, with a carrier base of approximately 136,400. ICS revenue for 2021 was $2.54 billion.\nFMS Segment\nFMS provides final-mile delivery services to customers through a nationwide network of cross-dock and other delivery system network locations, with 98% of the continental U.S. population living within 150 miles of a network location. FMS provides both asset and non-asset big and bulky delivery and installation services, as well as fulfillment and retail-pooling distributions services. FMS contracts with customers range from one to five years, with the average being approximately three years.\nAt December 31, 2021, this segment operated 1,272 company-owned trucks, 272 customer-owned trucks, and 19 independent contractor trucks. FMS also operates 1,036 owned pieces of trailing equipment and 185 customer-owned trailers. The FMS segment employed 3,161 people, including 1,697 drivers and 189 delivery and material assistants, at December 31, 2021. FMS revenue for 2021 was $842 million.\nJBT Segment\nThe service offering in this segment is full-load, dry-van freight, utilizing tractors and trailers operating over roads and highways. JBT also offers services though our J.B. Hunt 360box® program which utilizes our J.B. Hunt 360 platform to access capacity and offer efficient drop trailer solutions to our customers. We typically pick up freight at the dock or specified location of the shipper and transport the load directly to the location of the consignee. We use our company-owned tractors and employee drivers or independent contractors or third-party carriers who agree to transport freight in our trailers.\nAt December 31, 2021, the JBT segment operated 734 company-owned tractors, 11,172 company-owned trailers, and employed 1,139 people, 733 of whom were drivers. At December 31, 2021, we had 1,501 independent contractors operating in the JBT segment. JBT revenue for 2021 was $796 million.\nMarketing and Operations\nWe transport, or arrange for the transportation of, a wide range of freight, including general merchandise, specialty consumer items, appliances, forest and paper products, food and beverages, building materials, soaps and cosmetics, automotive parts, agricultural products, electronics, and chemicals. Our customer base includes a large number of Fortune 500 companies. We provide many transportation services that meet the supply chain logistics needs of shippers.\nWe generally market all of our service offerings through a nationwide sales and marketing network. We use specific sales forces in DCS and FMS due to the length, complexity, and specialization of the sales cycle. In addition to our sales teams, J.B. Hunt 360 offers instant access to a wide array of technology-driven solutions for customers and carriers. Through the platform, businesses of all sizes can quote and book shipments, view analytics, and gain visibility into freight movement. In accordance with our typical arrangements, we bill the customer for all services, and we, in turn, pay all third parties for their portion of transportation services provided.\n5\nHuman Capital Resources\nGeneral\nDespite operating over 166,000 pieces of transportation equipment, our single greatest asset and one of the factors differentiating us from our competitors is our service-oriented people. J.B. Hunt strives to provide a supportive and safe work environment for its employees, where diverse and innovative ideas can be fostered to solve problems and provide value-added services for our customers. In addition to our employees, our customers, vendors, and communities in which we operate also share diverse backgrounds and an equally diverse range of interests and passions. J.B. Hunt puts forth its best effort to support initiatives reflecting the company values which are shared by its stakeholders.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had 33,045 employees, which consisted of 22,005 company drivers, 9,740 office personnel, 1,108 maintenance technicians, and 192 delivery and material assistants. We also had arrangements with 2,108 independent contractors to transport freight in our trailing equipment. None of our employees are represented by unions or covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nIn managing the Company’s business, management focuses on various human capital measures and objectives designed to address the development, attraction, and retention of personnel. These include competitive compensation and benefits, paid time off, employee retirement plan, bonus and other incentive compensation plans, modern equipment and support, leadership development, and tuition assistance as well as those described below.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe hold strongly to the principle that a qualified, diverse workforce, and inclusive workplace helps us represent the broad cross-section of ideas, values, and beliefs of our employees, customers, suppliers, and communities. In 2017, we established our Diversity and Inclusion initiative which reaches enterprise-wide and aims to create an inclusive culture and environment where employees from all backgrounds can succeed and be heard. Employees are evaluated and hired nationally in accordance with established criteria and regulatory requirements specific to their anticipated role within the Company.\nIn addition, the Company’s Employee Resource Groups (ERGs) offer opportunities for employee professional development, community engagement, and networking. Comprised of groups for women, Latinos, veterans, LGBTQIA+, and African Americans, our ERGs promote camaraderie within the workforce and allow employees with similar interests to build meaningful work relationships.\nEmployee Safety and Health\nThe health and well-being of our workforce is a priority as we continue to ingrain safety into our corporate culture and strive to conduct all our operations as safely as possible. J.B. Hunt employees participate in regular job-specific safety training programs. In addition, J.B. Hunt’s Million Mile Safe Driving and Recognition Awards Program has recognized and rewarded our drivers who dedicate themselves to accident-free driving. Since its inception in 1996, the program has awarded more than $33 million to over 4,100 drivers.\nWe believe that access to quality healthcare is also an important part of this priority, and we have programs in place that focus on improving the quality of care that our employees and their families receive. Paid leave is another key component of this focus and the Company offers benefit plans that comply with all applicable laws.\nIn response to COVID-19, we implemented safety response activities at our home office campus and all other field locations throughout North America which included requiring remote working when possible, expanded health and safety policies, facility modifications, increased security coverage, and purchase and distribution of personal protective equipment and supplies. During 2021, we committed to providing incremental paid time off for employees to help offset any financial loss caused by their absence from work when receiving the COVID-19 vaccination. Due to the nature of our business and the large portion of our workforce consisting of drivers and other non-office personnel, fewer than 25% of our total employees have been able to work remotely; however, we remain committed to the safety of our workforce, suppliers, and customers while continuing to meet our customers’ needs.\n6\nRevenue Equipment\nOur JBI segment utilizes uniquely designed high-cube containers and chassis, which can only be paired with each other and can be separated to allow the containers to be double-stacked on rail cars. The composition of our DCS trailing fleet varies with specific customer requirements and may include dry-vans, flatbeds, temperature-controlled, curtain-side vans, and dump trailers. We primarily utilize third-party carriers’ tractor and trailing equipment for our ICS segment. Our FMS segment primarily utilizes straight trucks or similar equipment through third-party carriers, while the JBT segment operates primarily 53-foot dry-van trailers.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our company-owned tractor and truck fleet consisted of 18,757 units. In addition, we had 2,108 independent contractors who operate their own tractors but transport freight in our trailing equipment. We operate with standardized tractors in as many fleets as possible, particularly in our JBI and JBT fleets. Due to our customers’ preferences and the actual business application, our DCS fleet is extremely diversified. We believe operating with relatively newer revenue equipment provides better customer service, attracts quality drivers, improved fuel efficiency and lowers maintenance expense. At December 31, 2021, the average age of our combined tractor fleet was 2.5 years, while our containers averaged 8.2 years of age and our trailers averaged 6.6 years. We perform routine servicing and preventive maintenance on our equipment at our regional terminal facilities.\nCompetition and the Industry\nThe freight transportation markets in which we operate are frequently referred to as highly fragmented and competitive. Our JBI segment competes with other intermodal marketing companies; other full-load carriers that utilize railroads for a portion of the transportation service; and, to a certain extent, some railroads directly. The diversified nature of the services provided by our DCS and FMS segments attracts competition from customers’ private fleets, other private fleet outsourcing companies, equipment leasing companies, local and regional delivery service providers, and some truckload carriers. Our ICS segment utilizes the fragmented nature of the truck industry and competes with other non-asset-based logistics companies and freight brokers, as well as full-load carriers. The full-load freight competition of our JBT segment includes thousands of carriers, many of which are very small. While we compete with a number of smaller carriers on a regional basis, only a limited number of companies represent competition in all markets across the country.\nWe compete with other transportation service companies primarily in terms of price, on-time pickup and delivery service, availability and type of equipment capacity, and availability of carriers for logistics services.\nRegulation\nOur operations as a for-hire motor carrier are subject to regulation by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) and the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA), and certain business is also subject to state rules and regulations. The DOT periodically conducts reviews and audits to ensure our compliance with federal safety requirements, and we report certain accident and other information to the DOT. Our operations into and out of Canada and Mexico are subject to regulation by those countries. We are also subject to a variety of requirements of national, state, and local governments, including the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration.\nOn September 9, 2021, President Biden issued an executive order that, in conjunction with guidance issued pursuant to the order, requires all employers with U.S. Government contracts to require their U.S.-based employees, contractors, or subcontractors who work on or in support of certain U.S. Government contracts, to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19 by December 8, 2021, with limited exceptions for medical and religious reasons permitted. Various states have challenged the mandate in multiple federal district courts resulting in the enforcement of this mandate to be currently enjoined nationwide. We are awaiting final resolution of this matter, but do not anticipate a negative impact on our operations or productivity.\n7\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. These laws and regulations have the effect of increasing the costs, risks and liabilities associated with our applicable operations. We are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced, we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities.\nWe continue to monitor the actions of the FMCSA and other regulatory agencies and evaluate all proposed rules to determine their impact on our operations."

    "text": "In addition to the factors outlined previously in this Form 10-K regarding forward-looking statements and other comments regarding risks and uncertainties, the following risk factors should be carefully considered when evaluating our business. Our business, financial condition or financial results could be materially and adversely affected by any of these risks.\nRisks Related to Our Industry\nOur business is significantly impacted by economic conditions, customer business cycles and seasonal factors.\nOur business is dependent on the freight shipping needs of our customers, which can be heavily impacted by economic conditions and other factors affecting their businesses. Recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers’ business cycles, particularly in market segments and industries where we have a significant concentration of customers, may substantially reduce freight volumes for which our customers need transportation services and lead to excess capacity in the industry and resulting pressure on the rates we are able to obtain for our services. Adverse economic conditions may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. In addition, our results of operations may be affected by seasonal factors. Customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season, and our operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months, primarily due to colder weather, which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time and higher maintenance costs. Any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nOur business is significantly impacted by the effects of national or international health pandemics on general economic conditions and the operations of our customers and third-party suppliers and service providers.\nOur operations can be heavily impacted by the effects of a widespread outbreak of contagious disease, principally the recent outbreak of the COVID-19 virus. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have and may continue to disrupt or restrict the freight shipping activities of some of our customers, on which our business is dependent. In addition, adverse economic conditions caused by COVID-19 may also require us to increase our reserve for bad debt losses. Furthermore, the continuation or resumption of COVID-19 related social and economic disruptions may lead to other events which could negatively impact our operations including service limitations of our third-party purchased transportation providers, reduced availability of drivers and other key employees, disruptions in the procurement of revenue equipment, restrictions at U.S. ports of call, excess capacity or rate reductions within the intermodal or trucking industries, inability of suppliers to continue activities, or volatile financial credit markets. The extent to which the COVID-19 outbreak and any future resurgences will impact general economic and business conditions is highly uncertain and unpredictable; however, any of these factors could have a significant adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\n8\nExtreme or unusual weather conditions can disrupt our operations, impact freight volumes, and increase our costs, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business results.\nCertain weather conditions such as ice and snow can disrupt our operations. Increases in the cost of our operations, such as towing and other maintenance activities, frequently occur during the winter months. Natural disasters such as hurricanes and flooding can also impact freight volumes and increase our costs.\nOur operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations, including legislative and regulatory responses to climate change. Compliance with environmental requirements could result in significant expenditures and the violation of these regulations could result in substantial fines or penalties.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the handling of hazardous materials, underground fuel storage tanks, and discharge and retention of storm water. We operate in industrial areas, where truck terminals and other industrial activities are located and where groundwater or other forms of environmental contamination have occurred. Our operations involve the risks of fuel spillage or seepage, environmental damage, and hazardous waste disposal, among others. We also maintain bulk fuel storage and fuel islands at several of our facilities. If a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances occurs, or if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations, it could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. If we should fail to comply with applicable environmental regulations, we could be subject to substantial fines or penalties and to civil and criminal liability.\nWe are also subject to existing and potential future laws and regulations with regards to public policy on climate change. If current regulatory requirements become more stringent or new environmental laws and regulations regarding climate change are introduced, we could be required to make significant expenditures or abandon certain activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\nWe depend on third parties in the operation of our business.\nOur JBI business segment utilizes railroads in the performance of its transportation services. The majority of these services are provided pursuant to contractual relationships with the railroads. While we have agreements with a number of Class I railroads, the majority of our business travels on the BNSF and the Norfolk Southern railways. A material change in the relationship with, the ability to utilize one or more of these railroads or the overall service levels provided by these railroads could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results. In addition, a portion of the freight we deliver is imported to the United States through ports of call that are subject to labor union contracts. Work stoppages or other disruptions at any of these ports could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe also utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers to complete our services. These third parties are subject to similar regulation requirements, which may have a more significant impact on their operations, causing them to exit the transportation industry. Aside from when these third parties may use our trailing equipment to fulfill loads, we do not own the revenue equipment or control the drivers delivering these loads. The inability to obtain reliable third-party carriers and independent contractors could have a material adverse effect on our operating results and business growth.\nRapid changes in fuel costs could impact our periodic financial results.\nFuel costs can be very volatile. We have a fuel surcharge revenue program in place with the majority of our customers, which has historically enabled us to recover the majority of higher fuel costs. Most of these programs automatically adjust weekly depending on the cost of fuel. However, there can be timing differences between a change in our fuel cost and the timing of the fuel surcharges billed to our customers. In addition, we incur additional costs when fuel price increases cannot be fully recovered due to our engines being idled during cold or warm weather and empty or out-of-route miles that cannot be billed to customers. Rapid increases in fuel costs or shortages of fuel could have a material adverse effect on our operations or future profitability. As of December 31, 2021, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations.\n9\nInsurance and claims expenses could significantly reduce our earnings.\nOur future insurance and claims expenses might exceed historical levels, which could reduce our earnings. If the number or severity of claims for which we are self-insured increases, our operating results could be adversely affected. We have policies in place for 2022 with substantially the same terms as our 2021 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage. We purchase insurance coverage for the amounts above which we are self-insured. If these expenses increase and we are unable to offset the increase with higher freight rates, our earnings could be materially and adversely affected.\nWe operate in a regulated industry, and increased direct and indirect costs of compliance with, or liability for violation of, existing or future regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nThe DOT, FMCSA, and various state agencies exercise broad powers over our business, generally governing matters including authorization to engage in motor carrier service, equipment operation, safety, and financial reporting. We are audited periodically by the DOT to ensure that we are in compliance with various safety, hours-of-service, and other rules and regulations. If we were found to be out of compliance, the DOT could restrict or otherwise impact our operations. Our failure to comply with any applicable laws, rules or regulations to which we are subject, whether actual or alleged, could expose us to fines, penalties or potential litigation liabilities, including costs, settlements and judgments. Further, these agencies could institute new laws, rules or regulations or issue interpretation changes to existing regulations at any time. Compliance with new laws, rules or regulations could substantially impair labor and equipment productivity, increase our costs or impact our ability to offer certain services.\nDifficulty in attracting and retaining drivers and delivery personnel could affect our profitability and ability to grow.\nIf we are unable to attract and retain the necessary quality and number of employees, we could be required to significantly increase our employee compensation package, let revenue equipment sit idle, dispose of the equipment altogether, or rely more on higher-cost third-party carriers, which could adversely affect our growth and profitability. In addition, our growth could be limited by an inability to attract third-party carriers upon whom we rely to provide transportation services.\nWe operate in a competitive and highly fragmented industry. Numerous factors could impair our ability to maintain our current profitability and to compete with other carriers and private fleets.\nWe compete with many other transportation service providers of varying sizes and, to a lesser extent, with LTL carriers and railroads, some of which have more equipment and greater capital resources than we do. Additionally, some of our competitors periodically reduce their freight rates to gain business, especially during times of reduced growth rates in the economy, which may limit our ability to maintain or increase freight rates or to maintain our profit margins.\nIn an effort to reduce the number of carriers it uses, a customer often selects so-called “core carriers” as approved transportation service providers, and in some instances, we may not be selected. Many customers periodically accept bids from multiple carriers for their shipping needs, and this process may depress freight rates or result in the loss of some business to competitors. Also, certain customers that operate private fleets to transport their own freight could decide to expand their operations, thereby reducing their need for our services.\nRisks Related to Our Business\nWe derive a significant portion of our revenue from a few major customers, the loss of one or more of which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nFor the calendar year ended December 31, 2021, our top 10 customers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately 39% of our revenue. One customer accounted for approximately 12% of our total revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our JBI, ICS, and JBT segments typically do not have long-term contracts with their customers. While our DCS and FMS segments may involve long-term written contracts, those contracts may contain cancellation clauses, and there is no assurance that our current customers will continue to utilize our services or continue at the same levels. A reduction in or termination of our services by one or more of our major customers could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results.\n10\nA determination that independent contractors are employees could expose us to various liabilities and additional costs.\nFederal and state legislation as well as tax and other regulatory authorities have sought to assert that independent contractors in the transportation service industry are employees rather than independent contractors. An example of such legislation recently enacted in California is currently under a judicial stay with respect to trucking companies while a legal challenge to the law is pending. There can be no assurance that interpretations that support the independent contractor status will not change, that other federal or state legislation will not be enacted or that various authorities will not successfully assert a position that re-classifies independent contractors to be employees. If our independent contractors are determined to be our employees, that determination could materially increase our exposure under a variety of federal and state tax, workers’ compensation, unemployment benefits, labor, employment and tort laws, as well as our potential liability for employee benefits. In addition, such changes may be applied retroactively, and if so, we may be required to pay additional amounts to compensate for prior periods. Any of the above increased costs would adversely affect our business and operating results.\nWe may be subject to litigation claims that could result in significant expenditures.\nWe by the nature of our operations are exposed to the potential for a variety of litigation, including personal injury claims, vehicular collisions and accidents, alleged violations of federal and state labor and employment laws, such as class-action lawsuits alleging wage and hour violations and improper pay, commercial and contract disputes, cargo loss and property damage claims. While we purchase insurance coverage at levels we deem adequate, future litigation may exceed our insurance coverage or may not be covered by insurance. We accrue a provision for a litigation matter according to applicable accounting standards based on the ongoing assessment of the strengths and weaknesses of the litigation, its likelihood of success, and an evaluation of the possible range of loss. Our inability to defend ourselves against a significant litigation claim could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe rely significantly on our information technology systems, a disruption, failure or security breach of which or an inability to keep pace with technological advances could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe rely on information technology throughout all areas of our business to initiate, track, and complete customer orders; process financial and nonfinancial data; compile results of operations for internal and external reporting; and achieve operating efficiencies and growth. We have also invested significantly in the development of our Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 online freight matching platform, through which we are generating an increasing amount of revenue. Each of our information technology systems may be susceptible to various interruptions, including equipment or network failures, failed upgrades or replacement of software, user error, power outages, natural disasters, cyber-attacks, theft or misuse of data, terrorist attacks, computer viruses, hackers, or other security breaches. We have mitigated our exposure to these risks through the establishment and maintenance of technology security programs and disaster recovery plans, but these mitigating activities may not be sufficient. A significant disruption, failure or security breach in our information technology systems could have a material adverse effect on our business, which could include operational disruptions, loss of confidential information, external reporting delays or errors, legal claims, or damage to our business reputation. We also could experience an inability to keep pace with technological advances, resulting in our information technology platforms becoming obsolete or our competitors developing related or similar service offerings more effective than ours.\n11\nAcquisitions or business combinations\nmay disrupt or have a material adverse effect on our operations or earnings.\nA substantial portion of the growth of our FMS segment has resulted from strategic acquisitions, and our future growth strategy for FMS and possibly other operating segments may involve the acquisition of one or more businesses. We could have difficulty integrating acquired companies’ assets, personnel and operations with our own.  Regardless of whether we are successful in making an acquisition or completing a business combination, the negotiations could disrupt our ongoing business, distract our management and employees, and increase our operating costs.  Acquisitions and business combinations are accompanied by a number of inherent risks, including, without limitation, the difficulty of integrating acquired companies and operations; potential disruption of our ongoing businesses and distraction of our management or the management of acquired companies; difficulties in maintaining controls, procedures and policies; potential impairment of relationships with employees and partners as a result of any integration of new management personnel; potential inability to manage an increased number of locations and employees; failure to realize expected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; or the effect of any government regulations which relate to the businesses acquired.\nOur business could be materially impacted if and to the extent that we are unable to succeed in addressing any of these risks or other problems encountered in connection with an acquisition or business combination involving FMS or other segments, many of which cannot be presently identified."

    "text": "The following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes in Item 8. This discussion contains forward-looking statements. Please see\n“\nForward-looking Statements\n”\nand\n“\nRisk Factors\n”\nfor a discussion of items, uncertainties, assumptions and risks associated with these statements.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of our financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that impact the amounts reported in our Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes. Therefore, the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses and associated disclosures of contingent liabilities are affected by these estimates. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis, utilizing historical experience, consultation with third parties and other methods considered reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, actual results may differ significantly from our estimates. Any effects on our business, financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recognized in the accounting period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known. We consider our critical accounting policies and estimates to be those that require us to make more significant judgments and estimates when we prepare our financial statements and include the following:\nWorkers\n’\nCompensation and Accident Costs\nWe purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. Certain insurance arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim. We have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs. We are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment.\nThe amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on measurement dates, policy expiration dates, and claim type. For 2019 through 2021, we were self-insured for $500,000 per occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for workers’ compensation claims for nearly all states. We have policies in place for 2022 with substantially the same terms as our 2021 policies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage.\nOur claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal, economic, and regulatory factors. Our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate personal injury and property damage claim liability. This process involves the use of expected loss rates, loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience, and contractual premium adjustment factors, if applicable. In doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurred-but-not-reported claims. We do not discount our estimated losses. At December 31, 2021, we had an accrual of approximately $287 million for estimated claims. In addition, we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of self-insurance levels on covered claims.  At December 31, 2021, we have recorded $311 million of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims, other insurance deposits, and prepaid insurance premiums.\nRevenue Equipment\nWe operate a significant number of tractors, trucks, containers, chassis, and trailers in connection with our business. This equipment may be purchased or acquired under lease agreements. In addition, we may rent revenue equipment from various third parties under short-term rental arrangements. Purchased revenue equipment is depreciated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life to an estimated salvage or trade-in value. We periodically review the useful lives and salvage values of our revenue equipment and evaluate our long-lived assets for impairment. We have not identified any impairment to our assets at December 31, 2021.\n15\nWe have agreements with our primary tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment. We have utilized these trade-in values, as well as other operational information such as anticipated annual miles, in accounting for depreciation expense.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services. Accordingly, we serve as a principal in the transaction. We invoice our customers, and we maintain discretion over pricing. Additionally, we are responsible for selection of third-party transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements.\nWe recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided, with related expenses recognized as incurred. Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.\nOur trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Receivables are recorded at amounts billed to customers when loads are delivered or services are performed. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated over the life of the underlying receivable and is based on historical experience; any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability; current economic conditions; and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, each applied to segregated risk pools based on the business segment that generated the receivable. The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes under the liability method. Our deferred tax assets and liabilities represent items that will result in a tax deduction or taxable income in future years for which we have already recorded the related tax expense or benefit in our statement of earnings. Deferred tax accounts arise as a result of timing differences between when items are recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements and when they are recognized in our tax returns. We assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income or the reversal of temporary timing differences. To the extent we believe recovery does not meet the more-likely-than-not threshold, a valuation allowance is established. To the extent we establish a valuation allowance, we include an expense as part of our income tax provision.\nSignificant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of complex tax laws and certain tax-related contingencies on our provision for income taxes. As part of our calculation of the provision for income taxes, we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions are at least more likely than not to be sustained upon audit based on the technical merits of the tax position. For tax positions that are not more likely than not to be sustained upon audit, we accrue the largest amount of the benefit that is not more likely than not to be sustained in our Consolidated Financial Statements. Such accruals require us to make estimates and judgments, whereby actual results could vary materially from these estimates. Further, a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established an accrual is audited and resolved. See Note 7, Income Taxes, in our Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of our current tax contingencies.\n16\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following table sets forth items in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a percentage of operating revenues and the percentage increase or decrease of those items compared with the prior year.\n2021 Compared With 2020\nConsolidated Operating Revenues\nOur total consolidated operating revenues increased 26.3% to $12.17 billion in 2021, compared to $9.64 billion in 2020. This increase was primarily due to increased ICS and JBT revenue, higher JBI revenue per load, increased average revenue producing trucks and fleet productivity within DCS, and increased FMS stops and revenue per stop. Fuel surcharge revenues increased 65.5% to $1.25 billion in 2021, compared to $757 million in 2020. If fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2021 revenue increased 22.9% over 2020.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nOur 2021 consolidated operating expenses increased 24.6% from 2020, while year-over-year revenue increased 26.3%, resulting in a 2021 operating ratio of 91.4% compared to 92.6% in 2020.\nRents and purchased transportation costs increased 30.2% in 2021, primarily due to increased third-party rail and truck purchased transportation rates in JBI and ICS, increased ICS load volume, and an increase in the use of third-party truck carriers by JBT and FMS during 2021. Salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 17.6% in 2021 from 2020. This increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to a tighter supply of qualified drivers, a trend we anticipate continuing, and an increase in the number of employees as well as an increase in incentive compensation compared to 2020. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.6% in 2021, primarily due to equipment purchases related to new DCS long-term customer contracts, the addition of trailing equipment and scheduled turnover of tractors within JBI, higher trailer counts in JBT, and increased capital investments in information technology.\n17\nFuel and fuel taxes expense increased 48.4% in 2021 compared with 2020, due primarily to an increase in the price of fuel during 2021 and increased road miles. We have fuel surcharge programs in place with the majority of our customers. These programs typically involve a specified computation based on the change in national, regional, or local fuel prices. While these programs may address fuel cost changes as frequently as weekly, most also reflect a specified miles-per-gallon factor and require a certain minimum change in fuel costs to trigger a change in fuel surcharge revenue. As a result, some of these programs have a time lag between when fuel costs change and when this change is reflected in revenues. Due to these programs, this lag negatively impacts operating income in times of rapidly increasing fuel costs and positively impacts operating income when fuel costs decrease rapidly. It is not meaningful to compare the amount of fuel surcharge revenue or the change in fuel surcharge revenue between reporting periods to fuel and fuel taxes expense, or the change of fuel expense between periods, as a significant portion of fuel cost is included in our payments to railroads, dray carriers and other third parties. These payments are classified as purchased transportation expense.\nOperating supplies and expenses increased 10.5% in 2021 compared with 2020, driven primarily by higher equipment maintenance costs, increased tire expense, increased tolls expense, higher travel and entertainment expense, and higher weather-related towing costs, partially offset by reduced operating supplies and building maintenance costs in response to COVID-19 compared to 2020. General and administrative expenses increased 8.6% from 2020, primarily due to higher advertising costs, increased technology spend, and increased driver hiring expenses, partially offset by a $5.7 million benefit from the reduction of a contingent liability in the FMS segment. Additionally, net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $5.5 million in 2021, compared to net losses of $4.4 million in 2020. Insurance and claims expense increased 22.7% in 2021, primarily due to higher incident volume and severity and increased insurance policy premium expenses, partially offset by a $3.2 million benefit from the net settlement of claims within the FMS segment.\nNet interest expense for 2021 decreased by 2.8% compared with 2020, due to lower effective interest rates on our debt. Income tax expense increased 49.4% in 2021, due primarily to increased taxable earnings in 2021. Our effective income tax rate was 23.9% in 2021 and 24.0% in 2020.\nSegments\nWe operated five business segments during calendar year 2021. The operation of each of these businesses is described in our Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. The following tables summarize financial and operating data by segment:\n18\nOperating Data by Segment\n19\nJBI Segment\nJBI segment revenue increased 17% to $5.45 billion in 2021, from $4.68 billion in 2020. This increase in revenue was primarily a result of an 19% increase in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rate changes, cost recovery efforts, and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a 2% decrease in load volume. Eastern network load volumes increased 1% and transcontinental loads decreased 3% compared to 2020. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased 14% compared to 2020.\nOperating income of the JBI segment increased to $603 million in 2021, from $428 million in 2020. Benefits from increased revenue per load were partially offset by network inefficiencies caused by continued rail and customer fluidity challenges, higher rail and third-party dray purchased transportation expense, higher driver wages and recruiting costs, increased non-driver salary, wages, and incentive compensation, and higher equipment costs when compared to 2020.\nDCS Segment\nDCS segment revenue increased 17% to $2.58 billion in 2021, from $2.20 billion in 2020. Productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, increased 8% compared to 2020. Productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 5% from 2020. The increase in productivity was primarily a result of contracted indexed-based price escalators and less unassigned idle equipment, partially offset by expected lower productivity within start-up accounts and an increase in open assigned trucks due to the tighter supply of qualified drivers and COVID-related labor disruptions. Customer retention rates remain above 98%.\nOperating income of our DCS segment decreased to $304 million in 2021, from $314 million in 2020. Higher revenues during the current year were more than offset by increases in driver wage and recruiting costs, increased non-driver salary, wages, and incentive compensation, increased casualty insurance and claims costs, higher group medical benefits, and additional costs related to the implementation of new, long-term customer contracts.\nICS Segment\nICS segment revenue increased 53% to $2.54 billion in 2021, from $1.66 billion in 2020. Revenue per load increased 46% when compared to 2020, primarily due to higher spot and contractual customer rates within the truckload business and changes in customer freight mix when compared to 2020. Overall volumes increased 5%, with truckload volumes increasing 13% when compared to 2020. Contractual business was 51% of the total load volume and 39% of the total revenue in the 2021, compared to 60% of the total load volume and 43% of the total revenue in 2020.\nICS segment had operating income of $46 million in 2021, compared to an operating loss of $45 million in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenue and higher gross profit margins, partially offset by higher personnel incentive compensation, and increased technology costs. Gross profit margin increased to 11.8% in the current year versus 9.9% last year. Approximately $1.58 billion of ICS revenue for 2021 was executed through the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 compared to $1.14 billion in 2020. ICS’s carrier base increased 36% when compared to 2020.\nFMS Segment\nFMS revenue increased 22% to $842 million in 2021 from $689 million in 2020, primarily due to the addition of multiple customer contracts implemented during the current year and 2020 including temporary suspension of operations at several customer sites as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stop count for 2021 increased 11%, while productivity, defined as revenue per stop, increased 10% compared to 2020. The increase in productivity was primarily due to a shift in the mix of business between asset and asset-light operations and the implementation of higher rates.\nFMS segment had operating income of $28 million in 2021 compared to an operating loss of $1 million in 2020. The increase in operating income was primarily due to increased revenues, a $5.7 million benefit from the reduction of a contingent liability, and a $3.2 million benefit from the net settlement of claims. These items were partially offset by higher implementation costs related to new long-term contractual business, higher third-party contract carrier costs, lower volumes with certain customers related to product availability because of supply chain disruptions, and higher personnel salary, wages, and incentive compensation.\n20\nJBT Segment\nJBT segment revenue increased 72% to $796 million in 2021, from $463 million in 2020. Excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2021 increased 70% compared to 2020, primarily due to a 10% increase in load volume and a 55% increase in revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue per load compared to 2020. The 2021 growth in load count was primarily due to the continued expansion of J.B. Hunt 360box which leverages the J.B. Hunt 360 platform to access drop trailer capacity for customers across our transportation network. At the end of 2021, JBT operated 2,235 tractors and 11,172 trailers compared to 1,769 and 8,567 at the end of 2020.\nJBT segment had operating income of $65 million in 2021 compared with $17 million in 2020. The increase in operating income was driven primarily by increased load counts and revenue per load during 2021, which were partially offset by increases in purchased transportation expense, higher costs to attract and retain drivers, higher non-driver salary, wages, and incentive compensation, and additional costs from further investments in the trailer network and technology related to the continued expansion of J.B. Hunt 360box.\n2020 Compared With 2019\nConsolidated Operating Revenues\nOur total consolidated operating revenues increased 5.1% to $9.64 billion in 2020, compared to $9.17 billion in 2019, primarily due to increased ICS revenue per load, the December 2019 acquisition and new contractual business onboarded throughout 2020 in FMS, and increased load volumes in JBT and DCS. The increase in revenue was partially offset by a decrease in JBI revenue per load. Fuel surcharge revenues decreased 27.4% to $757 million in 2020, compared to $1.04 billion in 2019. If fuel surcharge revenues were excluded from both years, our 2020 revenue increased 9.3% over 2019.\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\nOur 2020 consolidated operating expenses increased 5.8% from 2019, while year-over-year revenue increased 5.1%, resulting in a 2020 operating ratio of 92.6% compared to 92.0% in 2019.\nRents and purchased transportation costs increased 9.4% in 2020, primarily due to increased load volume and third-party rail and truck purchased transportation rates in JBI and ICS and an increase in the use of third-party truck carriers by FMS and JBT during 2020, partially offset by JBI 2019 rail purchased transportation costs including a $26.8 million charge resulting from the issuance of an award regarding our arbitration with BNSF. Salaries, wages and employee benefit costs increased 8.3% in 2020 from 2019. This increase was primarily related to increases in driver pay and office personnel compensation due to a tighter supply of qualified drivers and an increase in the number of employees as well as higher cost of employee group medical benefits compared to 2019. In addition, 2020 included a $12.3 million one-time COVID-19 related bonus paid to employee drivers and other key field personnel. Depreciation and amortization expense increased 5.7% in 2020, primarily due to equipment purchases related to new DCS long-term customer contracts and the addition of standard and specialized trailing equipment within our JBI segment.\nFuel and fuel taxes expense decreased 22.8% in 2020 compared with 2019, due primarily to a decrease in the price of fuel during 2020.\n21\nOperating supplies and expenses were virtually flat in 2020 compared with 2019, driven primarily by higher operating supplies and building maintenance costs in response to COVID-19, increased toll costs, and higher equipment maintenance costs, offset by reduced travel and entertainment expenses. General and administrative expenses decreased 6.2% from 2019, primarily due to decreased professional fees, lower advertising costs, lower driver hiring expenses and, decreased net loss from the sale or disposal of assets, partially offset by increased technology spend on the J.B. Hunt 360 platform and legacy system upgrades, higher bad debt expenses, and increased building rental expenses. Additionally, net losses from sale or disposal of assets were $4.4 million in 2020, compared to net losses of $13.1 million in 2019. Insurance and claims expense decreased 14.5% in 2020, primarily due to the absence of a $20 million FMS claim settlement charge and $17.4 million in reserve charges in 2019 for arbitration related legal fees, cost and interest claimed by BNSF, partially offset by an increase in insurance premiums in 2020.\nNet interest expense for 2020 decreased by 11.0% compared with 2019, due to lower effective interest rates on our debt. Income tax expense decreased 2.8% in 2020, due primarily to decreased taxable earnings in 2020. Our effective income tax rate was 24.0% in 2020 and 24.2% in 2019.\nJBI Segment\nJBI segment revenue decreased 1% to $4.68 billion in 2020, from $4.74 billion in 2019. This decrease in revenue was primarily a result of a 3% decrease in revenue per load, which is the combination of changes in freight mix, customer rates, and fuel surcharge revenue, partially offset by a 2% increase in load volume. Eastern network load volumes decreased 1% and transcontinental loads increased 4% compared to 2019. Average length of haul increased 1% in 2020 when compared to 2019. Revenue per load excluding fuel surcharges increased approximately 1% compared to 2019.\nOperating income of the JBI segment decreased to $428 million in 2020, from $447 million in 2019. Benefits from increased load volume in 2020 were more than offset by higher rail purchased transportation costs, COVID-19 related network inefficiencies, higher personnel costs, which included a one-time COVID-19 related bonus paid to employee drivers and other key field personnel, and higher dray costs resulting from disruptions in rail capacity and a constricted labor and truck capacity environment. Operating income for JBI in 2019 was impacted by a $26.8 million charge to rail purchase transportation expense resulting from the issuance of a final award regarding our arbitration with BNSF and a $17.4 million charge to insurance and claims expense, for arbitration related legal fees, cost and interest claimed by BNSF.\nDCS Segment\nDCS segment revenue increased 3% to $2.20 billion in 2020, from $2.13 billion in 2019. Productivity, defined as revenue per truck per week, remained flat when compared to 2019. Productivity excluding fuel surcharge revenue increased 2% from 2019. The increase in productivity was primarily a result of better utilization of assets between customer accounts, contracted customer rate increases, and increased customer supply chain fluidity. Customer retention rates remain above 98%.\nOperating income of our DCS segment increased to $314 million in 2020, from $278 million in 2019. The increase is primarily due to increased fleet productivity, the absence of significant new customer implementation costs throughout the majority of the year, lower driver related turnover costs, and lower travel and entertainment expenses. Operating income was partially offset by higher non-driver personnel costs, a one-time COVID-19 related bonus and higher equipment ownership costs when compared to 2019.\nICS Segment\nICS segment revenue increased 23% to $1.66 billion in 2020, from $1.35 billion in 2019. Overall volumes increased 2%, with truckload volumes increasing 15% when compared to 2019. Revenue per load increased 21% when compared to 2019 primarily due to customer mix changes and higher spot and contractual pricing. Contractual business was approximately 60% of the total load volume and 43% of the total revenue in the 2020, compared to 65% of the total load volume and 49% of the total revenue in 2019.\nICS segment incurred an operating loss of $45 million in 2020, compared to operating loss of $11 million in 2019. The increase in operating loss was primarily due to lower gross profit margins and increased technology spending as the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 continues to expand in functionality and capacity. Gross profit margin decreased to 9.9% in 2020 versus 13.1% last year primarily due to a more competitive pricing environment and constricted supply dynamics compared to 2019. Approximately $1.14 billion of ICS revenue for 2020 was executed through the Marketplace for J.B. Hunt 360 compared to $840 million in 2019. ICS’s carrier base increased 19%.\n22\nFMS Segment\nFMS revenue increased 22% to $689 million in 2020 from $567 million in 2019, primarily due to two business acquisitions completed in 2019 and an increase in new customer contracts throughout 2020, partially offset by the temporary suspension of operations at various customer sites in 2020 as a result of the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Stop count for 2020 increased 30%, and productivity, defined as revenue per stop, decreased 7% compared to 2019. The reduction in productivity was primarily due to a change in the mix of service methods to a more asset-light model resulting from the 2019 business acquisitions and a shift in the mix of services provided during 2020 as customers were affected by COVID-19 within our FMS network.\nFMS segment had an operating loss of $1 million in 2020 compared to an operating loss of $9 million in 2019. The current period operating loss was primarily due to increased costs to expand and improve, through service quality performance controls, the FMS network, lost revenue resulting from the temporary suspension of operations at several customer sites in response to COVID-19, higher bad debt expense, higher personnel costs, which included a one-time COVID-19 related bonus, higher COVID-19 related operating supplies expense an increase in noncash amortization expense attributable to the 2019 business acquisitions. FMS segment operating loss for 2019 included a $20 million insurance claim settlement charge.\nJBT Segment\nJBT segment revenue increased 19% to $463 million in 2020, from $389 million in 2019. Excluding fuel surcharges, revenue for 2020 increased 23% compared to 2019, primarily due to a 17% increase in load volume and a 5% increase in revenue excluding fuel surcharge revenue per load compared to 2019. The 2020 growth in load count was partially due to the continued expansion of J.B. Hunt 360box which leverages the J.B. Hunt 360 platform. At the end of 2020, JBT operated 1,769 tractors and 8,567 trailers compared to 1,831 and 6,975 at the end of 2019.\nJBT segment had operating income of $17 million in 2020 compared with $29 million in 2019. The decrease in operating income was driven primarily by higher purchased transportation expense and higher non-driver personnel cost and technology modernization expenses for the continued expansion of J.B. Hunt 360box compared to 2019.\n23\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nNet cash provided by operating activities totaled $1.22 billion in 2021, compared to $1.12 billion in 2020, due to increased earnings, partially offset by the timing of general working capital activities.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $877 million in 2021, compared with $613 million in 2020. The increase resulted primarily from an increase in equipment purchases, net of proceeds from the sale of equipment in 2021.\nNet cash used in financing activities was $305 million in 2021, compared with $232 million in 2020. This increase resulted primarily from an increase in treasury stock purchased and dividends paid in 2021.\nOur dividend policy is subject to review and revision by the Board of Directors, and payments are dependent upon our financial condition, liquidity, earnings, capital requirements, and other factors the Board of Directors may deem relevant. We paid a $0.26 per share quarterly dividend in 2019, a $0.27 per share quarterly dividend in 2020, a $0.28 per share quarterly dividend in the first quarter of 2021, and a $0.30 per share quarterly dividend in the last three quarters of 2021. On January 20, 2022, we announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $0.30 to $0.40 per share, which was paid February 18, 2022, to stockholders of record on February 4, 2022. We currently intend to continue paying cash dividends on a quarterly basis. However, no assurance can be given that future dividends will be paid.\nLiquidity\nOur need for capital has typically resulted from the acquisition of containers and chassis, trucks, tractors and trailers required to support our growth and the replacement of older equipment as well as periodic business acquisitions. We are frequently able to accelerate or postpone a portion of equipment replacements or other capital expenditures depending on market and overall economic conditions. However, we do anticipate that the current challenges related to timely delivery of ordered equipment will continue due to supply chain challenges impacting production. In recent years, we have obtained capital through cash generated from operations, revolving lines of credit and long-term debt issuances. We have also periodically utilized operating leases to acquire revenue equipment. For our senior notes maturing in 2022, it is our intent to pay the entire outstanding balances in full, on or before the maturity dates, using our existing cash balance, senior revolving line of credit or other sources of long-term financing.\nWe believe our liquid assets, cash generated from operations, and revolving line of credit will provide sufficient funds for our operating and capital requirements for the foreseeable future. At December 31, 2021, we had a cash balance of $356 million and we had no outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit, which authorizes us to borrow up to $750 million under a senior revolving line of credit, and is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks that expires in September 2023. This senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to $250 million and to request a one-year extension of the maturity date. The applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees.\nWe continue to evaluate the possible effects of current economic conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts on operational cash flows, including the risks of declines in the overall freight market and our customers' liquidity and ability to pay. We regularly monitor working capital and maintain frequent communication with our customers, suppliers and service providers. A large portion of our cost structure is variable. Purchased transportation expense represents more than half of our total costs but is heavily tied to load volumes. Our second largest cost item is salaries and wages, the largest portion of which is driver pay, which includes a large variable component.\nOur senior notes consist of three separate issuances. The first is $250 million of 3.85% senior notes due March 2024, which was issued in March 2014. Interest payments under this note are due semiannually in March and September of each year, beginning September 2014. The second is $350 million of 3.30% senior notes due August 2022, issued in August 2015. Interest payments under this note are due semiannually in February and August of each year, beginning February 2016. The third is $700 million of 3.875% senior notes due March 2026, issued in March 2019. Interest payments under this note are due semiannually in March and September of each year, beginning September 2019. We may redeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture. We currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively convert our $350 million of 3.30% fixed-rate senior notes due August 2022 to a variable rate, resulting in an interest rates of 1.51% at December 31, 2021. The applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on LIBOR plus an established margin.\n24\nOur financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios. At December 31, 2021, we were well above compliance with all covenants and financial ratios, and we fully intend and expect to emerge from the current COVID-19 related economic environment with our investment-grade rating intact. In addition, we do not anticipate the future international transitioning from LIBOR to alternative rates to have a material impact on our financial statements.\nWe are currently committed to spend a total of approximately $1.88 billion, net of proceeds from sales or trade-ins, during 2022 and 2023, which is primarily related to the acquisition of tractors, containers, chassis, and other trailing equipment.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nWe had no off-balance sheet arrangements, other than our net purchase commitments of $1.88 billion, as of December 31, 2021."

    "text": "Interest rate risk can be quantified by measuring the financial impact of a near-term adverse increase in short-term interest rates on variable-rate debt outstanding. Our total long-term debt consists of both fixed and variable interest rate facilities. Our senior notes have fixed interest rates ranging from 3.30% to 3.875%. These fixed-rate facilities reduce the impact of changes to market interest rates on future interest expense. Our senior revolving line of credit has variable interest rates, which are based on the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate, or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus any applicable margins. We currently have an interest rate swap agreement which effectively converts our $350 million of 3.30% fixed-rate senior notes due August 2022 to a variable rate. The applicable interest rate under this swap agreement is based on LIBOR plus an established margin. Our earnings would be affected by changes in these short-term variable interest rates. At our current level of borrowing, a one-percentage-point increase in our applicable rate would reduce annual pretax earnings by $3.5 million.\nAlthough we conduct business in foreign countries, international operations are not material to our consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. Additionally, foreign currency transaction gains and losses were not material to our results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, we are not currently subject to material foreign currency exchange rate risks from the effects that exchange rate movements of foreign currencies would have on our future costs or on future cash flows we would receive from our foreign investment. To date, we have not entered into any foreign currency forward exchange contracts or other derivative financial instruments to hedge the effects of adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nThe price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations due to changes in the level of global oil production, seasonality, weather, and other market factors. Historically, we have been able to recover a majority of fuel-price increases from our customers in the form of fuel surcharges. We cannot predict the extent to which volatile fluctuations in fuel prices will continue in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected to offset fuel-price increases. As of December 31, 2021, we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel-price fluctuations.\n25"

Our internal control over financial reporting is designed by, or under the supervision of, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitation, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. We assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on our assessment, our management has concluded that as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that also audited our Consolidated Financial Statements. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s report on internal control over financial reporting is included herein.\n33\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and the related consolidated statements of earnings, of stockholders' equity and of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and schedule of valuation and qualifying accounts for the year ended December 31, 2021 appearing under Item 15(A)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n34\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nPersonal injury and property damage claims accrual\nAs described in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company is substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to owned and leased revenue equipment.  As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s claims accrual balance for self-insured claims was $287 million, of which a significant portion of claims related to personal injury and property damage. The Company recognizes a liability at the time of the incident based on an analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by third-party claims administrators, as well as legal, economic, and regulatory factors. Management uses an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of the ultimate personal injury and property damage claim liability, which involves the use of expected loss rates and loss-development factors based on historical claims experience.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the personal injury and property damage claims accrual is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the claims accrual estimate; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating management's significant assumptions related to the expected loss rates and loss-development factors based on historical claims experience and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s personal injury and property damage claims accrual process, including controls over the development of expected loss rates and loss-development factors based on historical claims experience. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for developing the claims accrual estimate; (ii) evaluating the appropriateness of the actuarial method; (iii) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the personal injury and property damage claims accrual estimate; and (iv) evaluating the reasonableness of management’s significant assumptions related to the expected loss rates and loss- development factors based on historical claims experience used in the calculation of the estimate. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of (i) the Company’s claims accrual process and (ii) the expected loss rate and loss-development factors used in developing the estimate.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nFayetteville, Arkansas\nFebruary 25, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2021.\n35\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020, the related consolidated statements of earnings, stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes to the financial statements (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the two years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nWe served as the Company’s auditor from 2005 to 2021.\nRogers, Arkansas\nFebruary 22, 2021\n36\n37\n38\n39\n40\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nJ.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is\none\nof the largest surface transportation and delivery service companies in North America. We operate\nfive\ndistinct, but complementary, business segments and provide a wide range of general and specifically tailored freight and logistics services to our customers. We generate revenues from the actual movement of freight from shippers to consignees, customized labor and delivery services, and serving as a logistics provider by offering or arranging for others to provide the transportation service. Unless otherwise indicated by the context, “we,” “us,” “our” and “JBHT” refer to J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nBasis of Consolidation\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements include all of our wholly owned subsidiaries. Intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation. J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. is a parent-level holding company with\nno\nsignificant assets or operations. J.B. Hunt Transport, Inc. is a wholly owned subsidiary of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. and is the primary operating subsidiary. All other subsidiaries of J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc. are insignificant.\nUse of Estimates\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements contained in this report have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. The preparation of these statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the amounts reported in such statements and accompanying notes. We evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis utilizing historical experience, consulting with experts and using other methods we consider reasonable in the particular circumstances. Nevertheless, our actual results\nmay\ndiffer significantly from our estimates.\nWe believe certain accounting policies and estimates are of more significance in our financial statement preparation process than others. We believe the most critical accounting policies and estimates include the economic useful lives and salvage values of our assets, provisions for uncollectible accounts receivable, estimates of exposures under our insurance and claims policies, and estimates for taxes. To the extent that actual, final outcomes are different from our estimates, or that additional facts and circumstances cause us to revise our estimates, our earnings during that accounting period will be affected.\nThe novel coronavirus (COVID-\n19\n) pandemic has created and\nmay\ncontinue to create significant uncertainty in macro-economic conditions, which\nmay\ncause a global economic recession, business slowdowns or shutdowns, depressed demand for our transportation and logistics businesses, and adversely impact our results of operations. We expect uncertainties around our key accounting estimates to continue to evolve depending on the duration and degree of impact associated with the COVID-\n19\npandemic. Our estimates\nmay\nchange, as new events occur and additional information is obtained, which are recognized or disclosed in our Consolidated Financial Statements as soon as they become known and\nmay\nhave a material impact on our financial statements.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash in excess of current operating requirements is invested in short-term, highly liquid investments. We consider all highly liquid investments purchased with original maturities of\nthree\nmonths or less to be cash equivalents.\n41\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance\nOur trade accounts receivable includes accounts receivable reduced by an allowance for uncollectible accounts. Receivables are recorded at amounts billed to customers when loads are delivered or services are performed. The allowance for uncollectible accounts is calculated over the life of the underlying receivable and is based on historical experience; any known trends or uncertainties related to customer billing and account collectability; current economic conditions; and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts, each applied to segregated risk pools based on the business segment that generated the receivable. The adequacy of our allowance is reviewed quarterly. Balances are charged against the allowance when it is determined the receivable will\nnot\nbe recovered. The allowance for uncollectible accounts for our trade accounts receivable was $\n16.8\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand $\n18.4\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2020.\nDuring\n2021,\nthe allowance for uncollectible accounts increased by $\n2.6\nmillion and was reduced $\n4.2\nmillion by write-offs. During\n2020,\nthe allowance for uncollectible accounts increased by $\n5.6\nmillion and was reduced $\n0.5\nmillion by write-offs.\nInventory\nOur inventories consist primarily of revenue equipment parts, tires, supplies, and fuel and are valued using the lower of average cost or net realizable value.\nInvestments in Marketable Equity Securities\nOur investments consist of marketable equity securities stated at fair value and are designated as either trading securities or available-for-sale securities at the time of purchase based upon the intended holding period. Changes in the fair value of our trading securities are recognized currently in “general and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions” in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Changes in the fair value of our available-for-sale securities are recognized in “accumulated other comprehensive income” on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, unless we determine that an unrealized loss is other-than-temporary. If we determine that an unrealized loss is other-than-temporary, we recognize the loss in earnings. Cost basis is determined using average cost.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nwe had\nno\navailable-for-sale securities. See Note\n8,\nEmployee Benefit Plans, for a discussion of our trading securities.\nProperty and Equipment\nDepreciation of property and equipment is calculated on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\n4\nto\n10\nyears for tractors,\n7\nto\n20\nyears for trailing equipment,\n10\nto\n40\nyears for structures and improvements,\n3\nto\n7\nyears for computer hardware and software, and\n3\nto\n10\nyears for furniture and other office equipment. Salvage values are typically\n10\n% to\n30\n% of original cost for tractors and trailing equipment and reflect any agreements with tractor suppliers for residual or trade-in values for certain new equipment. We periodically review these useful lives and salvage values. We capitalize tires placed in service on new revenue equipment as a part of the equipment cost. Replacement tires and costs for recapping tires are expensed at the time the tires are placed in service. Gains and losses on the sale or other disposition of equipment are recognized at the time of the disposition and are classified in general and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nWe continually evaluate the carrying value of our assets for events or changes in circumstances that indicate the carrying value\nmay\nnot\nbe recoverable. Recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by comparing the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset. If such assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets. Assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nLeases\nWe recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability on the effective date of a lease agreement. Right-of-use assets represent our right to use an underlying asset over the lease term and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make lease payments resulting from the lease agreement. We initially record these assets and liabilities based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term calculated using our incremental borrowing rate applicable to the leased asset or the implicit rate within the agreement if it is readily determinable. Lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are combined as a single lease component. Right-of-use assets additionally include net prepaid lease expenses. Options to extend or terminate an agreement are included in the lease term when it becomes reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Leases with an initial term of\n12\nmonths or less, short-term leases, are\nnot\nrecorded on the balance sheet. Lease expense for short-term and long-term operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, while variable lease payments are expensed as incurred.\n42\nRevenue Recognition\nWe record revenues on the gross basis at amounts charged to our customers because we control and are primarily responsible for the fulfillment of promised services. Accordingly, we serve as a principal in the transaction. We invoice our customers, and we maintain discretion over pricing. Additionally, we are responsible for selection of\nthird\n-party transportation providers to the extent used to satisfy customer freight requirements.\nOur revenue is earned through the service offerings of our\nfive\nreportable business segments. See Note\n14,\nSegment Information, for revenue reported by segment. All revenue transactions between reporting segments are eliminated in consolidation.\nIntermodal (JBI)\n- JBI segment includes freight that is transported by rail over at least some portion of the movement and also includes certain repositioning truck freight moved by JBI equipment or\nthird\n-party carriers, when such highway movement is intended to direct JBI equipment back toward intermodal operations. JBI performs these services primarily through contractual rate quotes with customers that are held static for a period of time, usually\none\nyear.\nDedicated Contract Services\n®\n(DCS\n®\n)\n- DCS segment business includes company-owned and customer-owned, DCS-operated revenue equipment and employee drivers assigned to a specific customer, traffic lane, or service. DCS operations usually include formal, written longer-term agreements or contracts that govern services performed and applicable rates.\nIntegrated Capacity Solutions (ICS)\n- ICS provides non-asset and asset-light transportation solutions to customers through relationships with\nthird\n-party carriers and integration with company-owned equipment. ICS services include flatbed, refrigerated, and less-than-truckload (LTL), as well as a variety of dry-van and intermodal solutions. ICS performs these services through customer contractual rate quotes as well as spot quotes that are\none\n-time rate quotes issued for a single transaction or group of transactions. ICS offers the majority of these services though an online multimodal marketplace via J.B. Hunt\n360°®\nthat matches the right load with the right carrier and the best mode.\nFinal Mile Services\n®\n(FMS)\n- FMS provides final-mile delivery services to customers through a nationwide network of cross-dock and other delivery system network locations. FMS provides both asset and non-asset big and bulky delivery and installation services, as well as fulfillment and retail-pooling distributions services. FMS operations usually include formal, written agreements or contracts that govern services performed and applicable rates.\nTruckload (JBT)\n- JBT business includes full-load, dry-van freight that is typically transported utilizing company-owned or company-controlled revenue equipment as well as services though our J.B. Hunt\n360box®\nprogram which utilizes our J.B. Hunt\n360\nplatform to access capacity and offer efficient drop trailer solutions to our customers. This freight is typically transported over roads and highways and does\nnot\nmove by rail. JBT utilizes both contractual rate quotes and spot rate quotes with customers.\nWe recognize revenue from customer contracts based on relative transit time in each reporting period and as other performance obligations are provided, with related expenses recognized as incurred. Accordingly, a portion of the total revenue that will be billed to the customer is recognized in each reporting period based on the percentage of the freight pickup and delivery performance obligation that has been completed at the end of the reporting period.\n43\nDerivative Instruments\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to changes in interest rates. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. If it is determined that a derivative is\nnot\nhighly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for under the liability method. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as income or expense in the period that includes the enactment date. We record valuation allowances for deferred tax assets to the extent we believe these assets are\nnot\nmore likely than\nnot\nto be realized through the reversal of existing taxable temporary differences, projected future taxable income, or tax-planning strategies. We record a liability for unrecognized tax benefits when the benefits of tax positions taken on a tax return are\nnot\nmore likely than\nnot\nto be sustained upon audit. Interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are classified as interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe compute basic earnings per share by dividing net earnings available to common stockholders by the actual weighted average number of common shares outstanding for the reporting period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if holders of unvested restricted and performance share units converted their holdings into common stock. Outstanding unvested restricted share units represent the dilutive effects on weighted average shares. A reconciliation of the number of shares used in computing basic and diluted earnings per share is shown below (in thousands):\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments, which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk, include trade receivables. For each of the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nour top\n10\ncustomers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately\n39\n%,\n37\n%, and\n32\n% of our total revenue. Our top\n10\ncustomers, based on revenue, accounted for approximately\n39\n% and\n37\n% of our total trade accounts receivable at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nrespectively. One customer accounted for approximately\n12\n%,\n10\n%, and\n8\n% of our total revenue for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nrespectively. Each of our\nfive\nbusiness segments conduct business with this customer.\nShare-based Compensation\nWe have a share-based compensation plan covering certain employees, including officers and directors. We account for share-based compensation utilizing the fair value recognition provisions of current accounting standards for share-based payments. We currently utilize restricted share units and performance share units. Issuances of our stock upon restricted share unit and performance share unit vesting are made from treasury stock. Our restricted share unit and performance share unit awards\nmay\ninclude both graded-vesting and cliff-vesting awards and therefore vest in increments during the requisite service period or at the end of the requisite service period, as appropriate for each type of vesting. We recognize compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service periods within each award. The benefit for the forfeiture of an award is recorded in the period in which it occurs.\n44\nClaims Accruals\nWe purchase insurance coverage for a portion of expenses related to employee injuries, vehicular collisions, accidents, and cargo damage. We are substantially self-insured for loss of and damage to our owned and leased revenue equipment. Certain insurance arrangements include a level of self-insurance (deductible) coverage applicable to each claim. We have umbrella policies to limit our exposure to catastrophic claim costs.\nThe amounts of self-insurance change from time to time based on measurement dates, policy expiration dates, and claim type. For\n2019\nthrough\n2021,\nwe were self-insured for $\n500,000\nper occurrence for personal injury and property damage and fully insured for workers’ compensation claims for nearly all states. We have policies in place for\n2022\nwith substantially the same terms as our\n2021\npolicies for personal injury, property damage, workers’ compensation, and cargo loss or damage.\nOur claims accrual policy for all self-insured claims is to recognize a liability at the time of the incident based on our analysis of the nature and severity of the claims and analyses provided by\nthird\n-party claims administrators, as well as legal, economic, and regulatory factors. Our safety and claims personnel work directly with representatives from the insurance companies to continually update the estimated cost of each claim. The ultimate cost of a claim develops over time as additional information regarding the nature, timing, and extent of damages claimed becomes available. Accordingly, we use an actuarial method to develop current claim information to derive an estimate of our ultimate personal injury and property damage claim liability. This process involves the use of expected loss rates, loss-development factors based on our historical claims experience, and contractual premium adjustment factors, if applicable. In doing so, the recorded liability considers future claims growth and provides a reserve for incurred-but-\nnot\n-reported claims. We do\nnot\ndiscount our estimated losses. At\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nwe had an accrual of approximately $\n287\nmillion and $\n257\nmillion, respectively, for estimated claims, which are recorded in claims accruals in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, we record receivables for amounts expected to be reimbursed for payments made in excess of self-insurance levels on covered claims.  At\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nwe have recorded $\n311\nmillion and $\n304\nmillion, respectively, of expected reimbursement for covered excess claims, other insurance deposits, and prepaid insurance premiums. Of these total asset balances, $\n171\nmillion and $\n167\nmillion have been included in other receivables, with the remaining balance included in prepaid expenses and other current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nrespectively.\nBusiness Combinations\nThe purchase price of our acquisitions is the aggregate of the consideration transferred, including liabilities incurred, measured at the acquisition date. We allocate the purchase price of acquisitions to tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. This assignment of fair values to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires the use of estimates, judgments, inputs, and assumptions. The excess of the purchase price over those estimated fair values is recorded as goodwill. Changes to the acquisition date provisional fair values prior to the end of the measurement period are recorded as adjustments to the associated goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses and restructuring costs, if any, are expensed as incurred.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of cost over the fair value of net identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired in a business combination. Goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are\nnot\namortized. Goodwill is reviewed, using a weighted market and income based approach, for potential impairment as of\nOctober 1\nst\non an annual basis or, more frequently, if circumstances indicate a potential impairment is present. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of\n2\nto\n15\nyears.\n45\nOutstanding borrowings, net of unamortized discount, unamortized debt issuance cost, and fair value swap, under our current financing arrangements consist of the following (in millions):\nAggregate maturities of long-term debt subsequent to\nDecember 31, 2021,\nare as follows: $\n356.0\nmillion in\n2022,\n$\n249.3\nmillion in\n2024,\nand $\n695.9\nmillion in\n2026.\nSenior Revolving Line of Credit\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe were authorized to borrow up to $\n750\nmillion under a senior revolving line of credit, which is supported by a credit agreement with a group of banks and expires in\nSeptember 2023.\nThis senior credit facility allows us to request an increase in the total commitment by up to $\n250\nmillion and to request a\none\n-year extension of the maturity date. The applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on either the Prime Rate, the Federal Funds Rate or LIBOR, depending upon the specific type of borrowing, plus an applicable margin based on our credit rating and other fees. At\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under this agreement.\nSenior Notes\nOur senior notes consist of\nthree\nseparate issuances. The\nfirst\nis $\n250\nmillion of\n3.85\n% senior notes due\nMarch 2024,\nwhich was issued in\nMarch 2014.\nInterest payments under this note are due semiannually in\nMarch\nand\nSeptember\nof each year, beginning\nSeptember 2014.\nThe\nsecond\nis $\n350\nmillion of\n3.30\n% senior notes due\nAugust 2022,\nissued in\nAugust 2015.\nInterest payments under this note are due semiannually in\nFebruary\nand\nAugust\nof each year, beginning\nFebruary 2016.\nThe\nthird\nis $\n700\nmillion of\n3.875\n% senior notes due\nMarch 2026,\nissued in\nMarch 2019.\nInterest payments under this note are due semiannually in\nMarch\nand\nSeptember\nof each year, beginning\nSeptember 2019.\nAll\nthree\nsenior notes were issued by J.B. Hunt Transport Services, Inc., a parent-level holding company with\nno\nsignificant assets or operations. The notes are guaranteed on a full and unconditional basis by a wholly-owned subsidiary. All other subsidiaries of the parent are inconsequential. We registered these offerings and the sale of the notes under the Securities Act of\n1933,\npursuant to shelf registration statements filed in\nFebruary 2014\nand\nJanuary 2019.\nAll notes are unsecured obligations and rank equally with our existing and future senior unsecured debt. We\nmay\nredeem for cash some or all of the notes based on a redemption price set forth in the note indenture. See Note\n4,\nDerivative Financial Instruments, for terms of an interest rate swap entered into on the\n$350\nmillion of\n3.30%\nsenior notes due\nAugust 2022.\nOur financing arrangements require us to maintain certain covenants and financial ratios.  We were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratios at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nWe periodically utilize derivative instruments for hedging and non-trading purposes to manage exposure to changes in interest rates and to maintain an appropriate mix of fixed and variable-rate debt. At inception of a derivative contract, we document relationships between derivative instruments and hedged items, as well as our risk-management objective and strategy for undertaking various derivative transactions, and assess hedge effectiveness. If it is determined that a derivative is\nnot\nhighly effective as a hedge, or if a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge, we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.\n46\nWe entered into a receive fixed-rate and pay variable-rate interest rate swap agreement simultaneously with the issuance of our $\n350\nmillion of\n3.30\n% senior notes due\nAugust 2022,\nto effectively convert this fixed-rate debt to variable-rate. The notional amount of this interest rate swap agreement equals that of the corresponding fixed-rate debt. The applicable interest rate under this agreement is based on LIBOR plus an established margin, resulting in an interest rate of\n1.51\n% for our $\n350\nmillion of\n3.30\n% senior notes at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe swap expires when the corresponding senior notes are due. The fair value of this swap is recorded in current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheet at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nSee Note\n9,\nFair Value Measurements, for disclosure of fair value. This derivative meets the required criteria to be designated as a fair value hedge, and as the specific terms and notional amount of this derivative instrument match those of the fixed-rate debt being hedged, this derivative instrument is assumed to perfectly hedge the related debt against changes in fair value due to changes in the benchmark interest rate. Accordingly, any change in the fair value of this interest rate swap recorded in earnings is offset by a corresponding change in the fair value of the related debt.\nWe have\none\nclass of preferred stock and\none\nclass of common stock. We had\nno\noutstanding shares of preferred stock at\nDecember 31, 2021\nor\n2020.\nHolders of shares of common stock are entitled to receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors and are entitled to\none\nvote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders. On\nJanuary 20, 2022\n,\nwe announced an increase in our quarterly cash dividend from $\n0.30\nto $\n0.40\nper share, which was paid\nFebruary 18, 2022\n,\nto stockholders of record on\nFebruary 4, 2022\n.\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe had\n1.7\nmillion shares of common stock to be issued upon the vesting of equity awards and\n4.6\nmillion shares reserved for future issuance pursuant to share-based payment plans. During calendar year\n2021,\nwe purchased approximately\n879,000\nshares, or $\n151.7\nmillion, of our common stock in accordance with plans authorized by our Board. At\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe had $\n351.1\nmillion available under an authorized plan to purchase our common stock.\nWe maintain a Management Incentive Plan (the “Plan”) that provides various share-based financial methods to compensate our key employees with shares of our common stock or common stock equivalents. Under the Plan, as amended, we have, from time to time, utilized restricted share units, performance share units, restricted shares, and non-statutory stock options to compensate our employees and directors. We currently are utilizing restricted and performance share units.\nOur restricted share units have various vesting schedules generally ranging from\n3\nto\n10\nyears when awarded. These restricted share units do\nnot\ncontain rights to vote or receive dividends until the vesting date. Unvested restricted share units are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason other than death, disability, or special circumstances as determined by the Compensation Committee. Restricted share units are valued based on the fair value of the award on the grant date, adjusted for dividend estimates based on grant date dividend rates.\nOur performance share units vest based on the passage of time (generally\n2\nto\n10\nyears) and achievement of performance criteria. Performance share units do\nnot\ncontain rights to vote or receive dividends until the vesting date. Unvested performance share units are forfeited if the employee terminates for any reason other than death, disability, or special circumstances as determined by the Compensation Committee. Performance shares are valued based on the fair value of the award on the grant date, adjusted for dividend estimates based on grant date dividend rates.\nAn employee is allowed to surrender shares of common stock received upon vesting to satisfy tax withholding obligations incident to the vesting of restricted share units and performance share units.\n47\nWe account for our restricted share units and performance share units in accordance with current accounting standards for share-based payments. These standards require that the cost of all share-based payments to employees be recognized in our Consolidated Financial Statements based on the grant date fair value of those awards. This cost is recognized over the period for which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award, subject to the attainment of performance metrics established for performance share units. The quantity of performance share units for which it is probable that the performance conditions will be achieved is estimated each reporting period, with any necessary adjustments recorded as a cumulative cost adjustment in the current period. Share-based compensation expense is recorded in salaries, wages, and employee benefits in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings, along with other compensation expenses to employees. The following table summarizes the components of our share-based compensation program expense (in thousands):\nA summary of our restricted share units and performance share units is as follows:\n48\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe had $\n71.4\nmillion and $\n19.5\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation expense related to restricted share units and performance share units, respectively, that is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted average vesting period of approximately\n3.2\nyears for restricted share units and\n2.5\nyears for performance share units.\nThe aggregate intrinsic value of restricted and performance share units vested during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nwas $\n84.9\nmillion, $\n73.0\nmillion, and $\n47.0\nmillion, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of unvested restricted and performance share units was $\n340.2\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021.\nThe total fair value of shares vested for restricted share and performance share units during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nwas $\n48.8\nmillion, $\n56.3\nmillion, and $\n41.1\nmillion, respectively.\nIncome tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes consists of (in thousands):\nIncome tax expense attributable to earnings before income taxes differed from the amounts computed using the statutory federal income tax rate of\n21\n% as follows (in thousands):\n49\nIncome taxes receivable was $\n33.7\nmillion and $\n3.1\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nrespectively. These amounts have been included in other receivables in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nare presented below (in thousands):\nGuidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes prescribes recognition and measurement criteria and requires that we assess whether the benefits of our tax positions taken are more likely than\nnot\nof being sustained under tax audits.  We have made adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits, a component of other long-term liabilities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as follows (in millions):\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nwe had a total of $\n78.5\nmillion and $\n66.1\nmillion, respectively, in gross unrecognized tax benefits.  Of these amounts, $\n67.2\nmillion and $\n57.1\nmillion represent the amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact our effective tax rate in\n2021\nand\n2020,\nrespectively.  Interest and penalties related to income taxes are classified as interest expense in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings.  The amount of accrued interest and penalties recognized during the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nwas $\n3.5\nmillion, $\n2.9\nmillion, and $\n3.2\nmillion, respectively. Future changes to unrecognized tax benefits will be recognized as income tax expense and interest expense, as appropriate.  The total amount of accrued interest and penalties for such unrecognized tax benefits at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nwas $\n6.4\nmillion and $\n5.6\nmillion, respectively.\nNo\nmaterial change in unrecognized tax benefits is expected in the next\n12\nmonths.\nTax years\n2018\nand forward remain subject to examination by federal tax jurisdictions, while tax years\n2011\nand forward remain open for state jurisdictions.\n50\nWe maintain a defined contribution employee retirement plan, which includes a\n401\n(k) option, under which all employees are eligible to participate. We match a specified percentage of employee contributions, subject to certain limitations. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\nour matching contributions to the plan were $\n28.1\nmillion, $\n24.5\nmillion, and $\n20.8\nmillion, respectively.\nWe have a nonqualified deferred compensation plan that allows eligible employees to defer a portion of their compensation. The compensation deferred under this plan is credited with earnings or losses on investments elected by plan participants. Each participant is fully vested in all deferred compensation and earnings; however, these amounts are subject to general creditor claims until actually distributed to the employee. A participant\nmay\nelect to receive deferred amounts in\none\npayment or in quarterly installments payable over a period of\n2\nto\n25\nyears upon reaching age\n55,\nhaving\n15\nyears of service, or becoming disabled. Our total liability under this plan was $\n26.0\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021,\nand $\n23.1\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nThese amounts are included in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Participant withholdings are held by a trustee and invested in equity securities as directed by participants. These investments are classified as trading securities and recorded at fair value. Realized and unrealized gains and losses are recognized currently in earnings. The investments are included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and totaled $\n26.0\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021,\nand $\n23.1\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2020.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nOur assets and liabilities measured at fair value are based on valuation techniques which consider prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets and liabilities. These valuation methods are based on either quoted market prices (Level\n1\n) or inputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly (Level\n2\n). The following are assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in millions):\nThe fair value of trading investments has been measured using the market approach (Level\n1\n) and reflect quoted market prices. The fair values of interest rate swap and corresponding senior notes have been measured using the income approach (Level\n2\n), which include relevant interest rate curve inputs. Trading investments are classified in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. At\nDecember 31, 2021,\nthe interest rate swap and senior notes are classified in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in prepaid expenses and other current assets and current portion of long-term debt, respectively. At\nDecember 31, 2020,\nthe interest rate swap and senior notes are classified in our Consolidated Balance Sheet in other assets and long-term debt, respectively.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe carrying amount of our senior revolving line of credit and remaining senior notes\nnot\nmeasured at fair value on a recurring basis was $\n945.2\nmillion and $\n944.1\nmillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nrespectively. The estimated fair value of these liabilities using the income approach (Level\n2\n), based on their net present value, discounted at our current borrowing rate, was $\n1.04\nbillion and $\n1.09\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nrespectively.\nThe carrying amounts of all other instruments at\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\napproximate their fair value due to the short maturity of these instruments.\n51\nAt\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe had outstanding commitments of approximately $\n1.88\nbillion, net of proceeds from sales or trade-ins during\n2022\nand\n2023,\nwhich is primarily related to the acquisition of tractors, containers, chassis, and other trailing equipment.\nDuring\n2021,\nwe issued financial standby letters of credit as a guaranty of our performance under certain operating agreements and self-insurance arrangements. If we default on our commitments under the agreements or other arrangements, we are required to perform under these guaranties. The undiscounted maximum amount of our obligation to make future payments in the event of defaults is approximately $\n5.0\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nAs the result of state use tax audits, we have been assessed amounts owed from which we are vigorously appealing. We have recorded a liability for the estimated probable exposure under these audits and await resolution of the matter.\nIn\n2019,\nwe paid $\n20\nmillion for the settlement of a casualty claim within our FMS segment.\nWe are involved in certain other claims and pending litigation arising from the normal conduct of business. Based on present knowledge of the facts and, in certain cases, opinions of outside counsel, we believe the resolution of these claims and pending litigation will\nnot\nhave a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or liquidity.\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021,\nwe had various obligations remaining under operating lease arrangements related primarily to the rental of maintenance and support facilities, cross-dock and delivery system facilities, office space, parking yards and equipment. Many of these leases include\none\nor more options, at our discretion, to renew and extend the agreement beyond the current lease expiration date or to terminate the agreement prior to the lease expiration date. These options are included in the calculation of our operating lease right-of-use asset and liability when it becomes reasonably certain the option will be exercised. Our lease obligations typically do\nnot\ninclude options to purchase the leased property, nor do they contain residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants. Operating leases with an initial term of more than\n12\nmonths are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as discounted liabilities and corresponding right-of-use assets consisting of the following (in millions):\nRight-of-use assets are classified in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Operating lease liability, current is classified in other accrued expenses, while operating lease liability, long-term is classified in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n52\nAs of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nthe weighted-average remaining lease term for our outstanding operating lease obligations was\n5.5\nyears and\n4.3\nyears, respectively. As of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand\n2020,\nthe weighted-average discount rate was\n1.97\n% and\n3.05\n%, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under these operating leases as of\nDecember 31, 2021,\nare as follows (in millions):\nDuring the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\ncash paid for amounts included in the measurement of operating lease liabilities was $\n59.5\nmillion, $\n49.7\nmillion, and $\n44.5\nmillion, while $\n58.6\nmillion, $\n50.2\nmillion, and $\n43.5\nmillion of operating lease expense was recognized on a straight-line basis, respectively. Operating lease expense is recorded in general and administrative expenses, net of asset dispositions in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings. During the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020,\nand\n2019,\na total of $\n101.9\nmillion, $\n57.0\nmillion, and $\n61.6\nmillion of right-of-use assets were obtained in exchange for new operating lease liabilities, of which, $\n4.4\nmillion and $\n19.1\nmillion was obtained through business combinations in\n2020\nand\n2019,\nrespectively.\nOn\nJanuary 31, 2022,\nwe entered into an agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain specified liabilities of Zenith Freight Lines, LLC (Zenith), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Bassett Furniture Industries Inc., subject to customary closing conditions. The closing of the transaction is expected to be effective on\nFebruary 28, 2022.\nThe purchase price was $\n87\nmillion. Upon closing of this acquisition, we will acquire customer contracts, net working capital, property and equipment, and assumed various facility leases. We anticipate using our existing cash balance to fund this transaction. The Zenith acquisition will be accounted for as a business combination and will operate within our FMS business segment.\nOn\nNovember 20, 2020,\nwe entered into an asset purchase agreement to acquire substantially all of the assets and assume certain specified liabilities of Mass Movement, Inc. (Mass Movement), subject to customary closing conditions. The closing of the transaction was effective on\nNovember 30, 2020,\nwith a purchase price of $\n25.5\nmillion. Of this total purchase price, $\n13.5\nmillion was deferred and is subject to an agreed-upon future earn-out calculation based on established cumulative earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) targets reported for the acquired operations in\n2021\nthrough\n2023.\nTotal consideration paid in cash under the Mass Movement agreement at closing was $\n12.1\nmillion and consisted of the remaining agreed upon purchase price of $\n12.0\nmillion adjusted for estimated working capital adjustments and other employee related liabilities. Accordingly, total consideration given under the Mass Movement agreement was $\n25.6\nmillion. Transaction costs incurred were\nnot\nmaterial. The Mass Movement acquisition was accounted for as a business combination and operates within our FMS business segment.
