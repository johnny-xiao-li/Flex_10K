(with respect to dispensing and mixing equipment for the paint industry); and Panduit Corporation (with respect to stainless steel bands, buckles and clamping systems).\nCustomers\nIn 2021, the Company did not have any customers that accounted for more than 3% of net sales. Since the Company serves a wide variety of markets, customer concentrations are not significant.\nInternational\nThe Company’s products and services are available worldwide, with manufacturing operations in more than 20 countries. The businesses located outside the U.S. are primarily based in Germany, U.K., Italy, India, China, Canada and The Netherlands.  The Company’s geographic diversity allows it to draw on the skills of a global workforce, provides greater stability to its operations, allows the Company to drive economies of scale, provides revenue streams that may help offset economic trends that are specific to individual economies and offers the Company an opportunity to access new markets for products. A strong foothold in these countries has allowed the Company to make great strides to expand its footprint in emerging markets, where the Company believes there is tremendous potential for growth across all segments.\n9\nThe following table illustrates sales to customers within and outside the U.S. as a percentage of total sales for total IDEX as well as by segment and by reporting unit for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nRaw Materials\nThe Company uses a wide variety of raw materials which are generally purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has an adequate supply of raw materials necessary to meet demand and continues to actively manage recent supply chain constraints. In addition, the Company is exposed to fluctuations in commodity pricing and inflation and attempts to control these impacts through increased prices to customers and various other programs with its suppliers.\nSuppliers\nThe Company manufactures many of the parts and components used in its products. Substantially all materials, parts and components purchased by the Company are available from a large number of independent sources around the world. The Company believes it has a sufficient number of suppliers necessary to meet demand and continues to actively manage recent supply chain constraints.\nInventory and Backlog\nThe Company regularly and systematically adjusts production schedules and quantities based on the flow of incoming orders. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, backlog generally was not considered a significant factor in the Company’s businesses as relatively short delivery periods and rapid inventory turnover are characteristic of most of the Company’s products. During 2021, backlog significantly increased due to supply chain constraints and inventory increased to support production. The Company remains focused on delivering products and services to customers against an elevated backlog and continues to actively manage inventory levels.\nShared Services\nThe Company has production facilities in Suzhou, China and Vadodara, India that support multiple business units. During 2021, the Company embarked on projects to expand both the China and India facilities in an effort to increase its footprint in these emerging markets as the Company believes there is tremendous potential for growth across all segments. The projects are expected to be completed in 2022. In addition, IDEX has personnel in China, India, Dubai, Mexico, Latin America and Singapore that provide sales, marketing, product design, engineering and sourcing support to its business units in those regions\n10\nas well as personnel in various locations in South America, the Middle East, Korea and Japan to support sales and marketing efforts in those regions.\nEmployees\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had 7,536 employees. Approximately 5% of its employees in the U.S. were represented by labor unions, with various contracts expiring through November 2023. Management believes that the Company has a positive relationship with its employees. The Company historically has been able to renegotiate its collective bargaining agreements satisfactorily, with its last work stoppage occurring in March 1993.\nHuman\nCapital\nManagement\nThe Company recognizes that its success would not be possible without the valuable contributions of its workforce. Investment in people enables the Company to accomplish its goals and deliver innovative customer solutions. The Company’s corporate Human Capital strategy is overseen by its Chief Human Resource Officer (“CHRO”). Annually, the CHRO presents a talent review to the Company’s Board of Directors. As part of the review, the team details each enterprise-level senior leadership position and outlines succession plans to ensure the Board is informed of the Company’s plans for business continuity and success.\nThe Company’s workforce advancement strategy succeeds through investment in three pillars: skill-building for the entire workforce, leadership development aligned with the Company’s methodology and fostering a great culture. The Company’s approach to training and education helps drive long-term value by providing employees with opportunities to develop skills both individually and as teams:\n•\nEmployees have access to learning through a variety of sources, including the IDEX Academy, which is the primary platform for global leadership development programs, local development programs and specific individual development plans. These trainings also help to develop future and potential leaders in the IDEX leadership methodology.\n•\nThe Company also enables employee development and growth by offering full-time U.S. employees who have at least six months of service the ability to participate in the Tuition Reimbursement program. Through the program, employees can have certain expenses from secondary educational institutions reimbursed up to $5,250 per year.\n•\nThe Company also built the IDEX Accelerating Management Potential (“I-AMP”) Collegiate Talent Program in 2018 to give early career professionals the opportunity to learn the Company’s values and business, and to grow within the Company in both full-time and internship roles. Since the program began, over 78 percent of participants have represented either gender or racial minority groups, and the Company will continue its focus on providing opportunities for diverse early career professionals.\n•\nThe Company prioritizes hiring team members who will embrace the team-driven culture and also places considerable emphasis on leveraging the talented employees within the Company’s internal pipeline, filling many leadership positions with Company employees.\n•\nAcross the enterprise, the Company’s goal is to achieve manufacturing company top quartile employee engagement as measured by its engagement survey. Given the challenges that the COVID-19 pandemic brought to the work environment, the Company is encouraged that employees are staying engaged as it remains in the top quartile among manufacturing companies with employee engagement at 76 percent.\nEmployee Pay and Benefits\nAttracting and retaining top talent is critical to the success of the Company’s business. The Company offers a highly competitive pay and benefits package for employees in all the markets where it operates. The performance-based pay packages provide many employees with short-term performance incentives. The Company also provides equity-based, long-term incentives to its senior leaders. In 2021, many of the Company’s business units took proactive action with off-cycle pay rate increases for hourly employees as the labor dynamics tightened. The Company increased its 2022 compensation budgets as related to previous years to maintain its focus on retaining key talent.\nThe Company’s U.S. employees can participate in a 401(k) retirement plan and an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which allows an employee to purchase IDEX stock through payroll deductions.\n11\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nThe Company has always recognized diversity as foundational to creativity and resilience; the three pillars of Innovation, Diversity and Excellence form the acronym that is the Company’s name, IDEX. Gender, ethnic, cultural and other human diversity is critical to the Company’s success.\nIn 2021, the Company hired a Vice President, Chief Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (“DE&I”) Officer (“CDO”) reporting directly to the Chief Executive Officer. Subsequently, the CDO engaged the executive leadership team and Board of Directors to finalize a three-year DE&I High Level Strategy and Tactics road map. Our Board of Directors regularly reviews DE&I progress. In 2021, the Board of Directors also added its first African American member.\nIn 2021, the Company increased its number of senior leaders who are racially diverse by 28%. The Company also saw a 5% increase in people managers that are racially diverse. Women in senior leadership and management roles held steady in 2021. As a part of the DE&I strategic roadmap, in 2022 the Company plans to: 1) hire a global DE&I team; 2) embed DE&I metrics into Executive Leadership Team goals and compensation; 3) review diverse talent quarterly with business leaders; 4) implement a company-wide inclusive leadership development plan; and 5) actively benchmark progress against competitors and DE&I best practice partners.\nFurther, the Company has been conducting pay equity analyses for U.S. employees since 2018 to ensure that employees’ actual pay was substantially similar to their predicted pay. Where appropriate, the Company provided base pay adjustments for employees that were outliers from their predicted pay, further reinforcing the Company’s commitment to diversity and a culture of inclusion, equality and respect.\nWorkplace Health & Safety\nThe Company is proud to manufacture highly engineered products, including many that have life-saving benefits. Doing this would not be possible without the systems the Company has developed and implemented to help ensure the health and safety of its employees, and those who work in the Company’s locations. The first part of this system is the IDEX Employee Health and Safety (“EHS”) Policy which outlines the Company’s vision to provide an injury free workplace for employees and prevent pollution of the environment. This is supplemented by the Company’s EHS Framework in which the Company defines the three pillars of its EHS system, and the nine elements that reside under these pillars. These two documents underpin EHS at IDEX and assist leadership and employees in meeting the Company’s vision.\nThe Company also encourages all full-time employees enrolled in the U.S. Healthcare Benefit Plan to participate in the third-party operated Wellness Program which provides access to annual biometric screenings, health evaluations and wellness credits that can be earned for meeting individual wellness goals each year. A number of the business units organize complementary wellness programs, including walking clubs, health fairs and lunch and learns with nutritionists for their employees.\nThe Company continued to remain vigilant with its employees’ health and safety in 2021 as it relates to the COVID-19 pandemic.  Many of the policies and procedures that were implemented in 2020 were continued or modified as the situation dictated.\nWorker Rights and Protection\nThe Company believes that a respectful workplace is free from unlawful discrimination and harassment, and this involves more than just compliance with the law. The Company strives to create a work environment that is free of inappropriate and unprofessional behavior and consistent with the Company’s values – a place where everyone is invited to do their best every day and feel free to report any concerns. The Company has policies, procedures and regular training in place to protect its workforce and prevent workplace harassment and discrimination. This includes a global Code of Business Conduct & Ethics policy where employees agree to follow and receive annual training. The Company also maintains a global hotline where employees are encouraged (and can choose to remain anonymous) to report any concerns or issues.\n12\nInformation about Our Executive Officers\nSet forth below are the names of the executive officers of the Company, their ages, years of service, the positions held by them and their business experience during the past five years.\nMr. Ashleman has served as President and Chief Executive Officer since December 2020.

Additional risks that the Company is not aware of or does not believe are material at the time of this filing may also become important factors that adversely affect the Company’s business.\nRisks Related to the Company’s Operations\nThe Company and its Results of Operations and Financial Condition Have Been and May Continue To Be Materially Adversely Impacted by the Ongoing COVID-19 Pandemic.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to be a rapidly-changing situation that has negatively impacted and could continue to negatively impact the global economy. The extent to which COVID-19 and the emergence of variant strains continues to impact the Company will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, such as the duration of the outbreak and business closures or business disruptions for the Company, its suppliers and its customers. Any changes in or resurgence of COVID-19 could have a material impact on the Company’s ability to get the raw materials, parts and components it needs to manufacture its products as its suppliers face disruptions in their businesses, closures or bankruptcy as a result of COVID-19. The Company depends greatly on its suppliers for items that are essential to the manufacturing of its products. If its suppliers fail to meet its manufacturing needs in the future, it would delay the Company’s production and product shipments to customers and negatively affect operations.\nThe Company has implemented work-from-home policies for certain “non-essential” employees. Although these work-from-home policies have not negatively impacted the Company in any material respect to date, COVID-19 is dynamic and any future resurgences could negatively impact productivity, disrupt conduct of the Company’s business in the ordinary course and delay production timelines. Due to the large remote workforce populations, the Company may also face informational technology infrastructure and connectivity issues from the vendors that it relies on for certain information technologies to administer, store and support the Company’s multiple business activities. IDEX is heavily dependent on the availability and support of its technology landscape, several of which are provided by external third party service providers (e.g., Microsoft, AT&T and Verizon). Although the Company has not suffered any disruptions to date, any future disruptions in their operations could also negatively impact the Company and its operating results and financial condition.\nTo the extent COVID-19 adversely affects the Company and its financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in Item 1A, “Risk Factors” of this annual report, such as those relating to international operations, the Company’s ability to develop new products, the Company’s ability to execute on its growth strategy of acquisitions, the Company’s dependency on raw materials, parts and components, the effects on movements in foreign currency exchange rates on the Company, the effects on the Company that result from declines in commodity prices and the Company’s reliance on labor availability to operate and grow the business.\nThe Company’s Inability to Continue to Develop New Products Could Limit Sales Growth.\nThe Company’s ability to continue to grow organically is tied in large part to its ability to continue to develop new products. A failure to continue to develop and deliver new, innovative and competitive products to the market could limit sales growth and negatively impact the Company and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company’s Growth Strategy Includes Acquisitions and the Company May Not be Able to Make Acquisitions of Suitable Candidates or Integrate Acquisitions Successfully.\nThe Company’s historical growth has included, and the Company’s future growth is likely to continue to include, acquisitions. The Company intends to continue to seek acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance its position in existing markets throughout the world. The Company may not be able to successfully identify suitable candidates, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing needed to consummate those acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions or successfully integrate acquired businesses into its existing operations. In addition, any acquisition, once successfully integrated, may not perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or otherwise prove beneficial to the Company.\n14\nAcquisitions involve numerous risks, including the assumption of undisclosed or unindemnified liabilities, difficulties in the assimilation of the operations, technologies, services and products of the acquired companies and the diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns. In addition, prior acquisitions have resulted in, and future acquisitions could result in, the incurrence of substantial additional indebtedness and other expenses.\nThe Markets Served by the Company are Highly Competitive and this Competition Could Reduce Sales and Operating Margins.\nMost of the Company’s products are sold in competitive markets. Maintaining and improving a competitive position will require continued investment in manufacturing, engineering, quality standards, marketing, customer service and support and distribution networks. The Company may not be successful in maintaining its competitive position. The Company’s competitors may develop products that are superior, may develop methods of more efficiently and effectively providing products and services or may adapt quicker to new technologies or evolving customer requirements. The Company may not be able to compete successfully with existing competitors or with new competitors. Pricing pressures may require the Company to adjust the prices of products to stay competitive. Failure to continue competing successfully could reduce sales, operating margins and overall financial performance.\nThe Company is Dependent on the Availability of Raw Materials, Parts and Components Used in Its Products.\nWhile the Company manufactures certain parts and components used in its products, the Company also requires substantial amounts of raw materials and purchases certain parts and components from suppliers. The availability of and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers’ allocations to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers, including due to geopolitical or civil unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, labor disruptions, supply chain disruptions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters, the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness, changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels. Any change in the supply of, or price for, these raw materials or parts and components could materially affect the Company and its financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.\nThe Company’s Business Operations May Be Adversely Affected by Information Systems Interruptions or Intrusion.\nThe Company depends on various information technologies to administer, store and support multiple business activities. If these systems (or the systems of the Company’s customers or third-party hosting services) are damaged, cease to function properly or are subject to cyber-security attacks, such as those involving unauthorized access, malicious software and/or other intrusions, the Company could experience production downtimes, operational delays, other detrimental impacts on operations or the ability to provide products and services to its customers, the compromising of confidential or otherwise protected information, destruction or corruption of data, security breaches, other manipulation or improper use of the Company’s systems or networks, financial losses from remedial actions, loss of business or potential liability, penalties, fines and/or damage to the Company’s reputation. While the Company attempts to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, technical security controls and maintenance of backup and protective systems, the Company’s systems, networks, products and services remain potentially vulnerable to known or unknown threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition or results of operations. Further, given the unpredictability, nature and scope of cyber-security attacks, it is possible that potential vulnerabilities could go undetected for an extended period.\nUncertainty Related to Environmental Regulation and Industry Standards, as well as Physical Risks of Climate Change, Could Impact the Company's Results of Operations and Financial Position.\nIncreased public awareness and concern regarding environmental risks, including global climate change, may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or industry standards to reduce or mitigate global warming and other environmental risks.  New climate change laws and regulations could require the Company to change its manufacturing processes or obtain substitute materials that may cost more or be less available for its manufacturing operations. Various jurisdictions in which the Company does business have implemented, or in the future could implement or amend, restrictions on emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases, limitations or restrictions on water use, the production of single use plastics, regulations on energy management and waste management and other climate change-based rules and regulations, which may increase the Company’s expenses and adversely affect its operating results.  In addition, the physical risks of climate change may impact the availability and cost of materials, sources and supply of energy, product demand and manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs.  The expected future increased worldwide regulatory activity relating to climate change could expand the nature, scope and complexity of matters that the Company is required to control, assess and report. If environmental laws or regulations or industry standards are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company, its suppliers, its customers or its products, or the\n15\nCompany's operations are disrupted due to physical impacts of climate change on the Company, its customers or its suppliers, the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nA Slowdown in the U.S. or International Economy Could Materially Adversely Affect the Sales and Profitability of the Company’s Businesses.\nIn 2021, 48% of the Company’s sales were derived from domestic operations while 52% were derived from international operations. The Company’s largest end markets include industrial, semiconductor, automotive, life sciences and medical technologies, fire and rescue, oil and gas, paint and coatings, chemical processing, agriculture, water and wastewater treatment and optical filters and components. A slowdown in the U.S. or global economy and, in particular, any of these specific end markets could materially reduce the Company’s sales and profitability.\nChanges to Geopolitical\nand Economic Conditions in the U.S. and Foreign Countries in Which the Company Operates Could Adversely Affect the Company.\nThe Company expects international operations and export sales to continue to be significant for the foreseeable future. The Company’s sales from international operations and sales from export are both subject in varying degrees to risks inherent in doing business outside the U.S. These risks include the following:\n•\npossibility of unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations and the risks related to required compliance with local laws;\n•\nrisks of economic instability, including due to inflation;\n•\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations and restrictions on currency repatriation;\n•\npotential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n•\ndisruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n•\nwithdrawal from or renegotiation of international trade agreements and other restrictions on the trade between the United States and other countries;\n•\nthe effects of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union, the European Atomic Energy Community and the United Kingdom that was entered into on December 30, 2020 following the United Kingdom’s decision to exit the European Union;\n•\nchanges in tariff and trade barriers, including uncertainty caused by the evolving relations between the United States and China; and\n•\ngeopolitical events, including natural disasters, climate change, public health issues, political instability (such as increasing tensions between Ukraine and Russia), terrorism, insurrection or war.\nAny of these events could have a materially adverse impact on the Company and its operations.\nSignificant Movements in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates May Harm the Company’s Financial Results.\nThe Company is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the Euro, Swiss Franc, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi and Swedish Krona. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which the Company does business against the U.S. Dollar could affect the Company’s ability to sell products competitively and control its cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.”\nFluctuations in Interest Rates Could Adversely Affect the Company’s Results of Operations and Financial Position.\nThe Company’s profitability may be adversely affected during any periods of unexpected or rapid increases in interest rates. The Company maintains a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”), which bears interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin based on the lower of the Company's senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio. A significant increase in LIBOR or the other rates the Company has agreed to use as a successor to LIBOR under the Revolving Facility, as amended, would significantly increase the Company’s cost of borrowings. Further, any changes in regulatory standards or industry practices, such as the ultimate discontinuation of the use of LIBOR and the transition to alternative benchmark rates may result in the usage of higher interest rates under the Revolving Facility, and the Company’s current or future indebtedness may be adversely affected. The Company is also exposed to risks if the U.S. Federal Reserve raises its benchmark interest rate, which may reduce the availability of and\n16\nincrease the cost of obtaining new debt and refinancing existing indebtedness. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\"\nA Significant or Sustained Decline in Commodity Prices, Including Oil, Could Negatively Impact the Levels of Expenditures by Certain of the Company’s Customers.\nDemand for the Company’s products depends, in part, on the level of new and planned expenditures by certain of its customers. The level of expenditures by the Company’s customers is dependent on, among other factors, general economic conditions, availability of credit, economic conditions within their respective industries and expectations of future market behavior. Volatility in commodity prices, including oil, can negatively affect the level of these activities and can result in postponement of capital spending decisions or the delay or cancellation of existing orders. The ability of the Company’s customers to finance capital investment and maintenance may also be affected by the conditions in their industries. Reduced demand for the Company’s products could result in the delay or cancellation of existing orders or lead to excess manufacturing capacity, which unfavorably impacts the absorption of fixed manufacturing costs. This reduced demand could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nRisks Related to Legal, Accounting and Regulatory Matters\nAn Unfavorable Outcome of Any Pending Contingencies or Litigation Could Adversely Affect the Company.\nThe Company is currently involved in pending and threatened legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may also involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Where it is reasonably possible to do so, the Company accrues estimates of the probable costs for the resolution of these matters. These estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based upon an analysis of potential results and the availability of insurance coverage, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. It is possible, however, that future operating results for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in assumptions, the continued availability of insurance coverage or the effectiveness of the Company’s strategies related to these proceedings. For additional detail related to this risk, see Item 3, “Legal Proceedings” and Note 11 in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nThe Company’s Intangible Assets, Including Goodwill, are a Significant Portion of Total Assets and a Write-off of  Intangible Assets or Goodwill Would Adversely Impact the Company’s Operating Results and Significantly Reduce the Company’s Net Worth.\nThe Company’s total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. At December 31, 2021, goodwill and intangible assets totaled $2,167.7 million and $597.3 million, respectively. These assets primarily result from acquisitions, representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the tangible net assets acquired. Annually, or when certain events occur that require a more current valuation, the Company assesses whether there has been an impairment in the value of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of the Company’s reporting units were to fall significantly below forecasted levels, the Company could be required to reflect, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating income for an impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill or identifiable intangible assets would adversely impact the Company’s results of operations and net worth. See\nin Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” for further discussion on goodwill and intangible assets.\nFailure To Comply with the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act or Other Applicable Anti-bribery Laws Could Have an Adverse Effect on the Company.\nThe U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. Recent years have seen a substantial increase in anti-bribery law enforcement activity with more frequent and aggressive investigations and enforcement proceedings by both the Department of Justice and the SEC, increased enforcement activity by non-U.S. regulators and increases in criminal and civil proceedings brought against companies and individuals. The Company’s policies mandate compliance with all anti-bribery laws. However, the Company operates in certain countries that are recognized as having governmental and commercial corruption. The Company’s internal control policies and procedures may not always protect it from reckless or criminal acts committed by employees or third-party intermediaries. Violations of these anti-bribery\n17\nlaws may result in criminal or civil sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company and its financial condition and results of operations.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe Company’s Success Depends on Its Executive Management and Other Key Personnel.\nThe Company’s future success depends to a significant degree on the skills, experience and efforts of its executive management and other key personnel and their ability to provide the Company with uninterrupted leadership and direction. The loss of the services of any of the executive officers or a failure to provide adequate succession plans for key personnel could have an adverse impact on the Company. The availability of highly qualified talent is limited and the competition for talent is robust. However, the Company provides long-term equity awards and certain other benefits for its executive officers which provides incentives for them to make a commitment to the Company. The Company’s future success will depend on its ability to have adequate succession plans in place and to attract, retain and develop qualified personnel. A failure to efficiently replace executive management members and other key personnel and to attract, retain and develop new qualified personnel could have an adverse effect on the Company’s operations and implementation of its strategic plan.\nChallenges with Respect to Labor Availability Could Negatively Impact the Company’s Ability to Operate or Grow the Business.\nThe Company’s success depends in part on the ability of its businesses to proactively attract, motivate and retain a qualified and highly skilled workforce in an intensely competitive labor market. A failure to attract, motivate and retain highly skilled personnel could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business.  Additionally, any labor stoppages or labor disruptions, including due to geopolitical unrest, unfavorable economic or industry conditions, catastrophic weather events, natural disasters or the occurrence of a contagious disease or illness could adversely affect the Company’s operating results or its ability to operate or grow the business."

The Company has invested a significant amount of capital to expand both the China and India facilities that will ultimately double the Company’s historic capacity in each of these countries. Otherwise, management considers its facilities suitable and adequate for the Company’s operations and believes the Company can meet demand increases over the near term with its existing facilities, especially given its operational improvement initiatives that usually increase capacity.\nA summary of properties used by the Company’s operations as of December 31, 2021 are shown in the following table\n:\n(1)\nOther includes shared service locations as well as the Company’s executive office, which occupies 40,261 square feet of leased space in Northbrook, Illinois and 16,268 square feet of leased space in Chicago, Illinois.\n18"

These components were acquired from third party suppliers and were not manufactured by the Company or any of the defendant subsidiaries. To date, the majority of the Company’s settlements and legal costs, except for costs of coordination, administration, insurance investigation and a portion of defense costs, have been covered in full by insurance, subject to applicable deductibles. However, the Company cannot predict whether and to what extent insurance will be available to continue to cover these settlements and legal costs, or how insurers may respond to claims that are tendered to them. Asbestos-related claims have been filed in jurisdictions throughout the United States and the United Kingdom. Most of the claims resolved to date have been dismissed without payment. The balance of the claims have been settled for various immaterial amounts. Only one case has been tried, resulting in a verdict for the Company’s business unit. No provision has been made in the financial statements of the Company, other than for insurance deductibles in the ordinary course, and the Company does not currently believe the asbestos-related claims will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations or cash flows."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements and related notes in this annual report. This discussion may contain forward-looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties. The Company’s actual results and the timing of selected events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward-looking statements as a result of several factors, including those set forth under\n, “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this annual report.\nThis discussion includes certain non-GAAP financial measures that have been defined and reconciled to their most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measures later in this Item under the headings “Non-GAAP Disclosures” and “Free Cash Flow.” This discussion also includes Operating working capital which has been defined later in this Item under the heading “Cash Flow Summary.” The non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n2021 Overview\nIDEX is an applied solutions provider specializing in the manufacture of fluid and metering technologies, health and science technologies and fire, safety and other diversified products built to customers’ specifications. IDEX’s products are sold in niche markets across a wide range of industries throughout the world.  Accordingly, IDEX’s businesses are affected by levels of industrial activity and economic conditions in the U.S. and in other countries where it does business and by the relationship of the U.S. dollar to other currencies. Levels of capacity utilization and capital spending in certain industries and overall industrial activity are important factors that influence the demand for IDEX’s products.\nIn 2021, the Company achieved a record year in sales, earnings per share and capital deployment as robust demand, targeted growth initiatives and the ability to capture price drove a strong rebound from 2020. Throughout the year, teams steadily navigated continued headwinds arising from material availability, logistical challenges and pandemic-related absenteeism exacerbated by the emergence of new COVID-19 variants. Despite these challenges, the Company expanded operating margin in a highly inflationary environment as previous investments to optimize cost position and productivity initiatives delivered value together with diligent price capture where possible. Finally, the Company delivered strong cash flow and deployed record capital, both within its existing portfolio and with the addition of ABEL and Airtech to the IDEX family of businesses.\nSelect key financial results for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to 2020 were as follows:\n•\nSales of $2.8 billion increased 18%; organic sales (which excludes acquisitions/divestitures and foreign currency translation) were up 12%.\n•\nOperating income of $637.0 million increased 22%. Adjusted operating income increased 23% to $661.4 million.\n•\nOperating margin of 23.0% was up 90 basis points. Adjusted operating margin increased 110 basis points to 23.9%.\n•\nNet income attributable to IDEX of $449.4 million increased 19%. Adjusted net income attributable to IDEX increased 21% to $481.6 million.\n•\nEBITDA of $723.8 million was 26% of sales and covered interest expense by almost 18 times. Adjusted EBITDA of $765.4 million was 28% of sales and covered interest expense by almost 19 times.\n•\nDiluted EPS attributable to IDEX of $5.88 increased $0.94, or 19%. Adjusted EPS attributable to IDEX of $6.30 increased $1.11, or 21%.\n•\nCash flows provided by operating activities of $565.3 million was flat as strong operating results were offset by volume-driven increases in working capital. Free cash flow of $492.6 million was 102% of adjusted net income attributable to IDEX.\nFocus and Outlook for 2022\nDuring 2022, the Company’s primary focus will be to:\n•\nNavigate the Short Term while Innovating for the Future.\nDemand for the Company’s differentiated technology remains strong. However, the degree to which the difficult supply chain and COVID-19 environment will persist remains highly variable, and the Company will continue to navigate the day-to-day operational challenges posed by external conditions. At the same time, the Company remains focused on the longer-term. The Company will continue to support efficient, innovative, value-creating processes and invest in resources necessary to ensure its businesses are well-positioned to take advantage of the growth potential ahead.\n22\n•\nBuild Great Global Teams.\nThe Company is committed to its core values and will continue to develop top performing teams. DE&I remains an area of focus as the Company looks to continue its trajectory in creating environments where people feel like they belong and are comfortable bringing their true selves to work.\n•\nDeploy Capital.\nThe Company deployed record capital in 2021 and has identified several organic investment opportunities that will result in even higher capital spending in 2022. Additionally, the pipeline for potential acquisitions continues to be strong. The Company anticipates deploying additional capital in 2022 to acquire IDEX-like businesses to further strengthen its portfolio.\nResults of Operations\nThe following is a discussion and analysis of the Company’s results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the year ended December 31, 2020. For the discussion related to the results of operations for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with the year ended December 31, 2019, refer to the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 25, 2021.\nPerformance in 2021 Compared with 2020\nSales increased 18%, reflecting a 12% increase in organic sales, a 4% increase from acquisitions (Airtech - June 2021, ABEL - March 2021 and Flow MD - February 2020) and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Sales increased 15% domestically and 20% internationally, and sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 52% and 51% of total sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCost of sales increased due to higher sales volume and cost inflation. Both gross profit and gross margin increased primarily due to volume leverage, partially offset by higher fair value inventory step-up charges related to acquisitions. Additionally, gross profit increased as a result of favorable price/cost.\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses increased primarily due to higher variable compensation and employee-related costs, higher amortization from acquisitions and higher acquisition expenses.\nThe Company incurre\nd restructuring expenses and asset impairments i\nn 2021 and 2020 primarily rela\nted to severance benefits for cost reduction actions as well as asset impairments related to the consolidation of certain facilities.\nOperating income increased 22%, reflecting a 20% increase in organic operating income, a 1% favorable impact from lower restructuring costs and a 2% favorable impact from foreign currency translation, partially offset by a 1% decrease driven by higher amortization and fair value inventory step-up charges related to acquisitions (Airtech - June 2021, ABEL - March\n23\n2021 and Flow MD - February 2020). The increase in organic operating income is primarily due to higher volume leverage and favorable price/cost, partially offset by incremental resource investments and targeted discretionary spending.\nOperating margin increased 90 basis points, reflecting a 170 basis point increase in organic operating margin and a 10 basis point favorable impact from lower restructuring costs, partially offset by a 90 basis point decrease due to acquisitions, which was driven by higher amortization and fair value inventory step-up charges. The increase in organic operating margin is primarily due to higher volume leverage, partially offset by incremental resource investments and targeted discretionary spending.\nOther expense - net increased primarily due to an $8.6 million noncash loss related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan, net of curtailment, and $2.3 million of higher losses on trading securities in 2021\n.\nOther expense - net\nincludes a loss on early debt redemption of $8.6 million in 2021 and $8.4 million in 2020.\nInterest expense decreased primarily due to\nlower interest rates on the Company’s indebtedness, partially offset by an increase in the amount of debt outstanding compared with 2020.\nThe Company’s provision for income taxes is based upon estimated annual tax rates for the year applied to federal, state and foreign income. The provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate increased as compared with 2020 due to a lower excess tax benefit related to share-based compensation in 2021 and the absence of a benefit from the finalization of the Global Intangible Low-Tax Income (“GILTI”) regulations that favorably impacted the 2020 effective tax rate.\nResults of Reportable Business Segments\nThe Company has three reportable segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies (“FMT”), Health & Science Technologies (“HST”) and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products (“FSDP”). For a detailed description of the operations within each segment, please refer to Part I,\n,\n“Business”\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nThe FMT segment designs, produces and distributes positive displacement pumps, valves, small volume provers, flow meters, injectors and other fluid-handling pump modules and systems and provides flow monitoring and other services for the food, chemical, general industrial, water and wastewater, agriculture and energy industries.\n•\nThe HST segment designs, produces and distributes a wide range of precision fluidics, rotary lobe pumps, centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, roll compaction and drying systems, pneumatic components and sealing solutions, high performance molded and extruded sealing components, custom mechanical and shaft seals, engineered hygienic mixers and valves, biocompatible medical devices and implantables, air compressors and blowers, optical components and coatings, laboratory and commercial equipment, precision photonic solutions and precision gear and peristaltic pump technologies. HST serves a variety of end markets, including food and beverage, pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical, cosmetics, marine, chemical, wastewater and water treatment, life sciences, research and defense markets.\n•\nThe FSDP segment designs, produces and distributes firefighting pumps, valves and controls, rescue tools, lifting bags, other components and systems for the fire and rescue industry, engineered stainless steel banding and clamping devices used in a variety of industrial and commercial applications and precision equipment for dispensing, metering and mixing colorants and paints used in a variety of retail and commercial businesses around the world.\nWithin its three reportable segments, the Company maintains 13 reporting units where the Company focuses on organic growth and strategic acquisitions. Management’s primary measurements of segment performance are sales, operating income and operating margin. Segment operating income excludes unallocated corporate operating expenses.\n24\nFluid & Metering Technologies Segment\n(1)\nAcquisitions included ABEL in March 2021 and Flow MD in February 2020. Based on the timing of its acquisition, Flow MD results for the first quarter of 2021 are reflected in the acquisitions/divestitures column while the remaining year-over-year fluctuation is included in the organic column.\n•\nThe change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Pumps reporting unit due to recovery within the industrial market, in the Water reporting unit due to recovery of the municipal water market and water-saving growth projects and in the Agriculture reporting unit due to increased global demand, partially offset by a decrease in the Energy reporting unit due to a decline in capital spending in the oil and gas markets.\n•\nSales increased 5% domestically and 19% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 47% and 44% of total segment sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n•\nOperating margin of 26.0% decreased 20 basis points compared with 26.2% in 2020. The change in operating margin was attributed to the following:\n◦\nOrganic operating margin increased 80 basis points due to higher volume leverage, favorable price/cost and a fair value inventory step-up charge in 2020 related to the Flow MD acquisition that did not reoccur in 2021, partially offset by increases to inventory reserves associated with COVID-19 new product development opportunities not materializing and resource investments.\n◦\nAcquisitions negatively impacted operating margin by 110 basis points due to:\n•\nA $2.5 million fair value inventory step-up charge related to the ABEL acquisition, which lowered operating margin by 20 basis points;\n•\nIncremental intangible asset amortization from the ABEL and Flow MD acquisitions of $4.0 million, which negatively impacted operating margin by 40 basis points; and\n•\nThe dilutive impact from acquisitions on overall FMT operating margin, which was primarily driven by the Flow MD acquisition.\nHealth & Science Technologies Segment\n(1)\nAcquisitions included Airtech in June 2021.\n•\nThe change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Scientific Fluidics & Optics reporting unit due to recovery within the analytical instrumentation market as well as increased microfluidics and optics demand, in the Sealing Solutions reporting unit due to strength in the semiconductor market and improvements in the automotive market and in the Material Processing Technologies reporting unit due to increased demand in the food and pharmaceutical markets.\n•\nSales increased 27% domestically and 24% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 56% and 57% of total segment sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n•\nOperating margin of 25.8% increased 280 basis points compared with 23.0% in 2020. The change in operating margin was attributed to the following:\n◦\nOrganic operating margin increased 410 basis points due to volume leverage and favorable price/cost, partially offset by targeted reinvestment.\n◦\nAcquisitions negatively impacted operating margin by 130 basis points due to the contributions of the Airtech business, which were more than offset by:\n25\n▪\nA $9.1 million fair value inventory step-up charge related to the Airtech acquisition, which lowered operating margin by 80 basis points; and\n▪\nIncremental intangible asset amortization from the Airtech acquisition of $8.6 million, which negatively impacted operating margin by 70 basis points.\nFire & Safety/Diversified Products Segment\n•\nThe change in organic sales was attributed to increases in the Dispensing reporting unit due to strong demand in the paint market and in the BAND-IT reporting unit due to improvements in the aerospace, energy and industrial markets, partially offset by a decrease in the Fire & Safety reporting unit due to a lack of large tenders for rescue tools and North America Fire OEM supply chain constraints slowing order to revenue conversion.\n•\nSales increased 17% domestically and 13% internationally. Sales to customers outside the U.S. were approximately 51% and 52% of total segment sales in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n•\nOperating margin of 26.1% increased 50 basis points compared with 25.6% in 2020. The change in organic operating margin was attributed to higher volume, partially offset by unfavorable price/cost and mix.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nLiquidity\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic (including the emergence of variant strains) has impacted and may continue to impact the Company’s operating cash flows, based on management’s current expectations and currently available information, the Company believes current cash, cash from operations and cash available under the Revolving Facility will be sufficient to meet its\noperating cash requirements, planned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings, pension and postretirement funding requirements, share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock for the foreseeable future\n. Additionally, in the event that suitable businesses are available for acquisition upon acceptable terms, the Company may obtain all or a portion of the financing for these acquisitions through the incurrence of additional borrowings.\nAt December 31, 2021, working capital was $1,198.0 million and the Company’s current ratio was 3.5 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the Company’s cash and cash equivalents totaled $855.4 million, of which $457.5 million was held outside of the United States. At December 31, 2021, there was no balance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $7.2 million of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility of $792.8 million. The Company believes that additional borrowings through various financing alternatives remain available, if required.\nCash Flow Summary\nThe following table is derived from the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows:\nOperating Activities\nCash flows provided by operating activities decreased $4.0 million to $565.3 million in 2021, primarily due to increases in working capital discussed below, mostly offset by higher earnings.\n26\nOperating working capital, calculated as accounts receivable plus inventory minus accounts payable, is used by management as a measurement of operational results as well as the short-term liquidity of the Company. The following table details operating working capital as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nOperating working capital increased $117.0 million to $548.0 million at December 31, 2021, with acquisition, divestiture and foreign currency translation impacts primarily driving a net $44.4 million of the increase. Excluding these impacts, the increase in accounts receivables was $49.4 million, driven by higher revenues as demand rebounded from 2020 levels; inventories increased $46.1 million to address higher demand and build safety stock to support production amid supply chain difficulties; and trade accounts payable increased $22.9 million as a result of timing of inventory purchases.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows used in investing activities increased $525.5 million to $698.1 million in 2021, primarily due to higher cash outflows for acquisitions with the addition of ABEL and Airtech in 2021 compared to Flow MD in 2020, for the purchase of marketable securities and for capital expenditures which significantly increased as the Company is expanding both its China and India facilities.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows used in financing activities decreased $33.1 million to $9.5 million in 2021. During 2021, the Company issued $500.0 million of 2.2625% Senior Notes and redeemed $350.0 million of 4.2% Senior Notes due December 2021 and increased its quarterly cash dividend to $0.54, resulting in dividend payments of $161.1 million. During 2020, the Company issued $500.0 million of 3.0% Senior Notes and redeemed $300.0 million of 4.5% Senior Notes due December 2020, paid $151.8 million in dividends and repurchased 0.9 million shares at a cost of $110.3 million.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe Company believes free cash flow, a non-GAAP measure, is an important measure of performance because it provides a measurement of cash generated from operations that is available for payment obligations such as\nplanned capital expenditures, interest and principal payments on all borrowings and quarterly dividend payments to holders of the Company’s common stock as well as\nfor funding acquisitions. Free cash flow is calculated as cash flows provided by operating activities less capital expenditures.\nThe following table reconciles free cash flow to cash flows provided by operating activities:\nThe decrease in free cash flow as compared to 2020 is due to a volume-driven build in working capital and higher investments in growth projects in 2021, including capital expenditures related to the expansion of facilities in China and India.\n27\nCash Requirements\nPending Acquisitions\nAs previously announced, on November 23, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nexsight, LLC and its businesses for cash consideration of $120.0 million. The Company expects to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company’s contractual obligations include borrowings and related interest, purchase obligations, pension and post-retirement medical benefit plans, rental payments under operating leases, payments under capital leases, a transition tax payable and other obligations arising in the ordinary course of business (such as acquisition commitments). There are no identifiable events or uncertainties, including the lowering of the Company’s credit rating, which would accelerate payment or maturity of any of these commitments or obligations. For a description of the funding requirements related to the Company’s contractual obligations, refer to\n(transition tax payable),\n(borrowings and related interest),\n(lease obligations),\n(pension and post-retirement obligations) and\n(acquisition commitments) in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company’s purchase obligations, consisting primarily of inventory commitments, totaled approximately $347.4 million, of which $320.4 million is expected to be settled during 2022 and the remainder thereafter.\nCapital Expenditures\nCash flows from operations were more than adequate to fund capital expenditures of $72.7 million and $51.6 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company believes it has sufficient operating cash flow to continue to meet current obligations and invest in planned capital expenditures. Capital expenditures are generally expenditures for machinery and equipment that support growth and improved productivity, tooling, business system technology, replacement of equipment and investments in new facilities.\nThe Company has invested a significant amount of capital to expand both the China and India facilities that will ultimately double the Company’s historic capacity in each of these countries. Otherwise, m\nanagement believes that the Company has ample capacity in its plants and equipment to meet demand increases for future growth in the intermediate term.\nCovenants\nThere are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Revolving Facility and the 2016 Private Placement Notes, a minimum interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of 3.50 to 1. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with both of these financial covenants, as the Company’s interest coverage ratio was 20.12 to 1 for covenant calculation purposes and the leverage ratio was 1.52 to 1. There are no financial covenants relating to the 2.625% Senior Notes or the 3.00% Senior Notes; however, both are subject to cross-default provisions. For a discussion of the Company’s Revolving Facility and Senior Notes as well as the associated covenants, refer to\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCredit Ratings\nThe Company’s credit ratings, which were independently developed by the following credit agencies, are detailed below:\n•\nS&P Global Ratings affirmed the Company’s corporate credit rating of BBB (stable outlook) in June 2021.\n•\nMoody’s Investors Service affirmed the Company’s corporate credit rating of Baa2 (stable outlook) in December 2021.\n•\nFitch Ratings affirmed the Company’s corporate credit rating of BBB+ (stable outlook) in March 2021.\nShare Repurchases\nThere were no share repurchases in 2021. The Company repurchased 0.9 million shares at a cost of $110.3 million in 2020. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining was $712.0 million. For additional information regarding the Company’s share repurchase program, refer to\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n28\nDividends\nThe Company increased its quarterly cash dividend by 8% from $0.50 per common share in 2020 to $0.54 per common share in 2021. Total dividend payments to common shareholders were $161.1 million in 2021 compared with $151.8 million in 2020.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe Company believes that the application of the following accounting policy, which is important to its financial position and results of operations, requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. For a summary of all of the Company’s accounting policies, including the accounting policy discussed below, see\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nGoodwill and intangible assets\n— The Company’s business acquisitions result in recording goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of amortization expense and possible impairment expense that the Company will incur in future periods. The Company evaluates the recoverability of certain noncurrent assets utilizing various estimation processes.  The Company follows the guidance prescribed in Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350,\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n, to test goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. The Company determines the fair value of each reporting unit utilizing an income approach (discounted cash flows) weighted 50% and a market approach (consisting of a comparable public company multiples methodology) weighted 50%. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of its indefinite-lived intangible assets. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. To determine the reasonableness of the calculated fair values, the Company reviews the assumptions to ensure that neither the income approach nor the market approach yielded significantly different valuations. Based on the results of the Company’s annual impairment test at October 31, 2021, all reporting units had fair values substantially in excess of their carrying values.\nThe key assumptions are updated every year for each reporting unit for the income and market approaches used to determine the fair value. Various assumptions are utilized including forecasted operating results, annual operating plans, strategic plans, economic projections, anticipated future cash flows, the weighted average cost of capital, market data and market multiples. The assumptions that have the most significant effect on the fair value calculations are the weighted average cost of capital, market multiples, forecasted EBITDA and terminal growth rates. The following assumption ranges were utilized by the Company in 2021 and 2020:\nSee\nfor further discussion on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n29\nNon-GAAP Disclosures\nSet forth below are reconciliations of each of Organic sales, Adjusted gross profit (and adjusted gross margin), Adjusted operating income (and adjusted operating margin), Adjusted net income attributable to IDEX, Adjusted diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) attributable to IDEX, Earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”) and Adjusted EBITDA to its respective most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure. Management uses these metrics to measure performance of the Company since they exclude items that are not reflective of ongoing operations, such as fair value inventory step-up charges, restructuring expenses and asset impairments, the impact of the settlement for a corporate transaction indemnity, losses on early debt redemptions and the loss related to the termination of the U.S. pension plan, net of curtailment. Management also supplements its U.S. GAAP financial statements with adjusted information to provide investors with greater insight, transparency and a more comprehensive understanding of the information used by management in its financial and operational decision making. The reconciliation of segment EBITDA and Adjusted segment EBITDA to net income was performed on a consolidated basis due to the fact that the Company does not allocate consolidated interest expense or the consolidated provision for income taxes to its segments.\nThis report references organic sales and organic operating income, non-GAAP measures, that exclude (1) the impact of foreign currency translation and (2) sales and operating income, respectively, from acquired or divested businesses during the first 12 months of ownership or prior to divestiture. The portion of sales and operating income attributable to foreign currency translation is calculated as the difference between (a) the period-to-period change in organic sales and organic operating income, respectively, and (b) the period-to-period change in organic sales and organic operating income, respectively, after applying prior period foreign exchange rates to the current year period. Management believes that reporting organic sales and organic operating income provides useful information to investors by helping to identify underlying growth trends in the Company’s business and facilitating easier comparisons of the Company’s revenue and operating performance with prior and future periods and to its peers. The Company excludes the effect of foreign currency translation from organic sales and organic operating income because foreign currency translation is not under management’s control, is subject to volatility and can obscure underlying business trends. The Company excludes the effect of acquisitions and divestitures because they can obscure underlying business trends and make comparisons of long-term performance difficult due to the varying nature, size and number of transactions from period to period and between the Company and its peers.\nGiven the acquisitive nature of the Company, which results in a higher level of amortization expense from recently acquired businesses, management uses EBITDA as an internal operating metric to provide another representation of the businesses’ performance across the Company’s three segments and for enterprise valuation purposes. Management believes that EBITDA is useful to investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the Company’s industry. Management believes that EBITDA margin is useful for the same reason as EBITDA. EBITDA is also used to calculate certain financial covenants, as discussed in\nin the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements in Part II, Item 8, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” such as EBITDA interest coverage, which is EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense. In addition, this report presents Adjusted EBITDA, which is EBITDA adjusted for items that are not reflective of ongoing operations as discussed above and Adjusted EBITDA interest coverage, which is Adjusted EBITDA divided by consolidated interest expense. Management believes that Adjusted EBITDA is useful as a performance indicator of ongoing operations. The Company believes that Adjusted EBITDA is also useful to some investors as an indicator of the strength and performance of the Company and its segments’ ongoing business operations and a way to evaluate and compare operating performance and value companies within the Company’s industry. The definition of Adjusted EBITDA used here may differ from that used by other companies.\nThis report also references free cash flow. This non-GAAP measure is discussed and reconciled to its most directly comparable GAAP measure in the section above titled “Cash Flow Summary.”\nThe non-GAAP financial measures disclosed by the Company should not be considered a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The financial results prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and the reconciliations from these results should be carefully evaluated.\n(1)\nEBITDA, a non-GAAP financial measure, is reconciled to net income, its most directly comparable U.S. GAAP financial measure, immediately above in Table 5.\n30"

    "text": "The Company is subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates. The Company may, from time to time, enter into foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on its debt when it believes there is a financial advantage in doing so. A treasury risk management policy, adopted by the Board of Directors, describes the procedures and controls over derivative financial and commodity instruments, including foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps. Under the policy, the Company does not use financial or commodity derivative instruments for trading purposes and the use of these instruments is subject to strict approvals by senior officers. Typically, the use of derivative instruments is limited to foreign currency forward contracts and interest rate swaps on the Company’s outstanding long-term debt. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any derivative instruments outstanding.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rates\nThe Company’s foreign currency exchange rate risk is limited principally to the Euro, Swiss Franc, British Pound, Canadian Dollar, Indian Rupee, Chinese Renminbi and Swedish Krona. The Company manages its foreign exchange risk principally through invoicing customers in the same currency as the source of products. The foreign currency transaction losses for the periods ending December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were\n$1.1 million\n,\n$3.0 million\nand\n$3.3 million\n, respectively, and are reported within Other expense - net on the Consolidated Statements of Income.

    "text": "MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, and as defined in Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(f).\nInternal control over financial reporting cannot provide absolute assurance of achieving financial reporting objectives because of its inherent limitations. Because of such limitations, there is a risk that material misstatements may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis by internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement has used the framework set forth in the report entitled “Internal Control — Integrated Framework” (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission to assess the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Management excluded ABEL and Airtech (Note 2 - Acquisitions) from its assessment of internal controls over financial reporting as these acquisitions occurred in 2021. This exclusion is in accordance with the general guidance from the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission that an assessment of a recently acquired business may be omitted from the scope of management’s assessment of internal control over financial reporting for one year following the acquisition. The total assets (excluding goodwill and intangible assets) and net sales of current year acquisitions represented were approximately 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Based on that assessment, management has concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, has been audited by Deloitte & Touche LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n32\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of IDEX Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nAs described in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management excluded ABEL and Airtech from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as these acquisitions occurred in the twelve months ended December 31, 2021.  The combined net sales and total assets of these acquisitions represented approximately 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of the consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Accordingly, our audit did not include the internal control over financial reporting at these acquired companies.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n33\n34\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of IDEX Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of IDEX Corporation and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue - Disaggregation of Revenue - Refer to Note 5 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is a highly diversified business with a wide range of products and services that are offered in various markets throughout the world. The Company’s business activities are carried out by numerous individual business units, which offer a unique set of products and include niche markets within specific geographic areas.\nWe identified revenue as a critical audit matter given the disaggregated nature of the Company’s operations and business units generating revenue. This required extensive audit effort due to the volume of the underlying transactions and distinctiveness of each individual business unit.  High levels of auditor judgment were necessary to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures and the level of disaggregation within the Company at which to perform such procedures, especially given limited market data for certain products or geographic areas.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n35\n•\nWe tested internal controls within the relevant revenue business processes, including controls over revenue recognition and controls over the review of significant revenue transactions and operating results.\n•\nFor a sample of revenue transactions, we performed detail transaction testing by agreeing the amounts recorded to source documents and determined that revenue was recognized appropriately.\n•\nFor the revenue populations subject to detail testing, we tested the completeness of revenue by making selections from reciprocal populations (e.g., shipping logs) and determined whether the transaction was recorded as a sale in the general ledger.\n•\nFor revenue transactions not subject to detail transaction testing, we aggregated the revenue transactions at the reporting unit level and performed substantive analytical procedures.

These products and services are grouped into\nthree\nreportable segments: Fluid & Metering Technologies (“FMT”), Health & Science Technologies (“HST”) and Fire & Safety/Diversified Products (“FSDP”).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the Company and its subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and accounts have been eliminated.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. The principal areas of estimation reflected in the financial statements are revenue recognition, sales returns and allowances, allowance for doubtful accounts, allowance for credit losses, inventory valuation, recoverability of long-lived assets, valuation of goodwill and intangible assets, income taxes, product warranties, contingencies and litigation, insurance-related items, defined benefit retirement plans and purchase accounting related to acquisitions.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company accounts for a contract with a customer when it has approval from both parties, the rights and payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. The Company determines the appropriate revenue recognition by analyzing the terms and conditions of the contract. Revenue is recognized when control of products or services is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the products or providing the services. Control is transferred to customers when performance obligations within a contract are satisfied. A performance obligation is a promise to transfer a distinct product or service to a customer.\nFor contracts that require complex design, manufacturing and installation activities, certain performance obligations may not be separately identifiable and, therefore, not distinct. As a result, the entire contract is accounted for as a single performance obligation. For contracts that include distinct products or services that are substantially the same and have the same pattern of transfer to the customer over time, they are recognized as a series of distinct products or services. Certain contracts have multiple performance obligations for which the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation using an estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct product or service and recognizes as revenue when, or as, the performance obligation is satisfied. For product sales, each product sold to a customer generally represents a distinct performance obligation. In such cases, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price. In certain cases, the Company may be required to estimate the standalone selling price using the expected cost plus margin approach, under which it forecasts the expected costs of satisfying a performance obligation and then adds an appropriate margin for the distinct product or service.\n42\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied at either a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue recognized at a point in time is approximately\n95\n% while revenue recognized over time is approximately\n5\n%. For performance obligations satisfied at a point in time, generally revenue recognition occurs with the transfer of control of the asset, which is in line with shipping terms. For performance obligations satisfied over time, revenue is recognized as work is performed based on the relationship between actual costs incurred to date for each contract and the total estimated costs for such contract at completion of the performance obligation (i.e. the cost-to-cost method) or ratably over the contract term for service revenue. The Company defines service revenue as revenue from activities that are not associated with the design, development or manufacture of a product or the delivery of a software license.\nWhen accounting for over-time contracts, the Company uses an input measure to determine the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The Company believes this measure of progress best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as the Company incurs costs on its contracts. Incurred cost represents work performed, which corresponds with the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs include labor, material and overhead. Contract estimates are based on various assumptions to project the outcome of future events. These assumptions include labor productivity and availability; the complexity of the work to be performed; the cost and availability of materials; the performance of subcontractors; and the availability and timing of funding from the customer. Revenues, including estimated fees or profits, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred.\nAs a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of the Company’s contracts, the Company reviews and updates its estimates regularly. Due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process, it is reasonably possible that completion costs, including those arising from contract penalty provisions and final contract settlements, will be revised. Such revisions to costs and income are recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined as a cumulative catch-up adjustment. The impact of the adjustment on profit recorded to date on a contract is recognized in the period the adjustment is identified. Revenue and profit in future periods of contract performance are recognized using the adjusted estimate. If at any time the estimate of contract profitability indicates an anticipated loss on the contract, the Company recognizes provisions for estimated losses on incomplete contracts in the period in which such losses are determined.\nThe Company records allowances for discounts and product returns at the time of sale as a reduction of revenue as such allowances can be reliably estimated based on historical experience and known trends. The Company also offers product warranties (primarily assurance-type) and accrues its estimated exposure for warranty claims at the time of sale based upon the length of the warranty period, warranty costs incurred and any other related information known to the Company.\nShipping and Handling Costs\nShipping and handling costs are included in Cost of sales and are recognized as a period expense during the period in which they are incurred.\nAdvertising Costs\nAdvertising costs of\n$\n10.7\nmillion\n, $\n9.9\nmillion and $\n15.7\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, are expensed as incurred within Selling, general and administrative expenses.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nThe Company considers all highly liquid instruments purchased with an original maturity of 3 months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.\nMarketable Securities\nThe Company holds investments in marketable securities, which are recorded in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments are recorded at fair value, with gains and losses, dividends and interest income included in Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See\nfor further discussion on the marketable securities held by the Company.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nAccounts receivable are recorded at face amount less an allowance for doubtful accounts. The Company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for expected losses as a result of customers’ inability to make required payments. Management evaluates the aging of the accounts receivable balances, the financial condition of its customers, historical trends and the time\n43\noutstanding of specific balances to estimate the amount of accounts receivable that may not be collected in the future and records the appropriate provision.\nInventories\nThe Company states inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes material, labor and overhead, is determined on a first in, first out basis. The Company makes adjustments to reduce the cost of inventory to its net realizable value, if required, for estimated excess, obsolete, zero usage or impaired balances. Factors influencing these adjustments include changes in market demand, product life cycle and engineering changes.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\nA long-lived asset is reviewed for impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the asset below its carrying value, as measured by comparing its net book value to the projected undiscounted future cash flows generated by its use. A long-lived asset impairment exists when the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value. The amount and\ntiming of the impairment charge for an asset requires the estimation of future cash flows to determine the fair value of the asset. An impaired asset is recorded at its estimated fair value based on a discounted cash flow analysis. Refer to\nfor further discussion on impairment of long-lived assets.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nAccounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 350,\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\n, requires that the Company review the carrying value of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets annually, or if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. The Company evaluates the recoverability of these assets as of October 31 based on the estimated fair value of each of the\n13\nreporting units and the indefinite-lived intangible assets. See\nfor further discussion on goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nBorrowing Expenses\nExpenses incurred in securing and issuing debt are capitalized and included as a reduction of Long-term borrowings. These amounts are amortized over the life of the related borrowing and the related amortization is included in Interest expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nEarnings per Common Share\nDiluted earnings per common share (“EPS”) attributable to IDEX is computed by dividing net income attributable to IDEX by the weighted average number of shares of common stock (basic) plus common stock equivalents outstanding (diluted) during the year. Common stock equivalents consist of stock options, which have been included in the calculation of weighted average shares outstanding using the treasury stock method, restricted stock and performance share units.\nASC 260,\nEarnings per Share\n, concludes that all outstanding unvested share-based payment awards that contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders. If awards are considered participating securities, the Company is required to apply the two-class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share. The Company has determined that its outstanding shares of restricted stock are participating securities. Accordingly, diluted EPS attributable to IDEX was computed using the two-class method prescribed by ASC 260.\nBasic weighted average shares outstanding reconciles to diluted weighted average shares outstanding as follows:\nOptions to purchase approximately\n0.3\nmillion\nshares of common stock in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted EPS attributable to IDEX because the effect of their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\n44\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company accounts for share-based payments in accordance with ASC 718,\nCompensation-Stock Compensation\n. Accordingly, the Company expenses the fair value of awards made under its share-based compensation plans. That cost is recognized in the consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period of the grants. See\nfor further discussion on share-based compensation.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost, with depreciation and amortization provided using the straight-line method over the following estimated useful lives:\nCertain identifiable intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives used in the computation of amortization of identifiable intangible assets are as follows:\nResearch and Development Expenditures\nCosts associated with engineering activities, including research and development, are expensed in the period incurred and are included in Cost of sales.\nTotal engineering expenses, which include research and development as well as application and support engineering, were $\n82.9\nmillion, $\n82.3\nmillion and $\n92.4\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Research and development expenses, which include costs associated with developing new products and major improvements to existing products, were $\n50.1\nmillion, $\n48.2\nmillion and $\n56.4\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively\n.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transaction\nThe functional currency of substantially all operations outside the United States is the respective local currency. Accordingly, those foreign currency balance sheet accounts have been translated using the exchange rates in effect as of the balance sheet date and the income statement amounts have been translated using the average monthly exchange rates for the year. Translation adjustments from year to year have been reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Foreign currency transaction gains and losses from transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the subsidiary involved are reported within Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nNet losses for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were\n$\n1.1\nmillion\n, $\n3.0\nmillion and $\n3.3\nmillion, respectively.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome tax expense includes U.S., state, local and international income taxes. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and for loss carryforwards. The tax rate used to determine the deferred tax assets and liabilities is the enacted tax rate for the year and the manner in which the differences are expected to reverse. Valuation allowances are recorded to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that will more likely than not be realized.\nSee\nfor further discussion on income taxes.\n45\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe Company is not dependent on a single customer as its largest customer accounted for less than\n3\n% of net sales for all years presented.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nIn December 2019, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12,\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n, which eliminates the need to analyze whether the following apply in a given period (1) exception to the incremental approach for intraperiod tax allocation, (2) exceptions to accounting for basis differences when there are ownership changes in foreign investments and (3) exceptions in interim period income tax accounting for year-to-date losses that exceed anticipated losses. This ASU is also designed to improve the application of income tax-related guidance and simplify U.S. GAAP for (1) franchise taxes that are partially based on income, (2) transactions with a government that result in a step-up in the tax basis of goodwill, (3) separate financial statements of legal entities that are not subject to tax and (4) enacted changes in tax laws in interim periods. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Standards\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n, which adds contract assets and contract liabilities to the list of exceptions to the recognition and measurement principles that apply to business combinations and requires that an acquirer recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with revenue recognition guidance. ASU 2021-08 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and interim periods therein. Early adoption is permitted. Entities should apply the ASU’s provisions prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10,\nGovernment Assistance (ASC 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\n, which requires entities to provide certain annual disclosures when they (1) have received government assistance and (2) use a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy to other accounting guidance. ASU 2021-10 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. Early adoption is permitted, and entities may apply the ASU’s provisions prospective or retrospectively. The adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\n2.\nAcquisitions and Divestitures\nAll of the Company’s acquisitions of businesses have been accounted for under ASC 805,\nBusiness Combinations\n. Accordingly, the accounts of the acquired companies, after adjustments to reflect the fair values assigned to assets and liabilities, have been included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements from their respective dates of acquisition. The results of operations of the acquired companies have been included in the Company’s consolidated results since the dates of acquisition. Supplemental pro forma information has not been provided as the acquisitions did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations individually or in the aggregate.\n2021 Acquisitions\nABEL\nOn March 10, 2021, the Company acquired the stock of ABEL Pumps, L.P. and certain of its affiliates (“ABEL”).

During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company contributed an additional\n$\n0.6\nmillion\n. As of December 31, 2021, the Joint Venture has incurred start-up expenses, but has not yet begun manufacturing. Since IDEX controls the entity, IDEX has consolidated the Joint Venture and recorded a noncontrolling interest in its Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn June 29, 2021, a subsidiary of IDEX funded a $\n4.2\nmillion convertible promissory note to a start-up company that provides communication technology to improve individual performance and team coordination for firefighters’ responses. The investment aligns with the FSDP segment’s strategic plan to reduce response time and greatly increase life-safety outcomes and is an extension of FSDP’s smart and connected products. The note bears paid-in-kind interest at a rate of\n5\n% per annum and is secured by the Company’s interest in the intellectual property of the start-up company. Unless earlier converted, the principal amount outstanding and the related accrued interest are due upon the earliest of (a) June 28, 2024, (b) a change in control or (c) when declared due and payable by the Company upon an event of default. The note is included in Other noncurrent assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the Company recorded\n$\n0.1\nmillion\nof accrued interest in Other noncurrent assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company will measure the allowance for credit losses under the current expected credit loss model. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\nallowance for credit losses has been recorded.\n51\n4.\nBalance Sheet Components\n52\nThe valuation and qualifying account activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n5.\nRevenue\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe Company has a comprehensive offering of products, including technologies, built to customers’ specifications that are sold in niche markets throughout the world. The Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by reporting unit and geographical region for each segment as the Company believes it best depicts how the amount, nature, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. Revenue was attributed to geographical region based on the location of the customer. The following tables present revenue disaggregated by reporting unit and geographical region.\nRevenue by reporting unit for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n(1)\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, the Company merged a business in the Water reporting unit with a business in the Valves reporting unit. Revenue for each reporting unit has been restated to reflect this change for all years presented.\n(2)\nThis reporting unit was previously named Gast and was renamed Performance Pneumatic Technologies upon the acquisition of Airtech. Prior to 2021, amounts reflect only the Gast business.\n53\nRevenue by geographical region for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\n(1)\nOther includes: South America, Middle East, Australia and Africa.\nPerformance Obligations\nThe Company’s performance obligations are satisfied either at a point in time or over time as work progresses. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers at a point in time approximated\n95\n% of total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Revenue from products and services transferred to customers over time approximated\n5\n% of total revenues in each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nContract Balances\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections can result in customer receivables, advance payments or billings in excess of revenue recognized. Customer receivables include both amounts billed and currently due from customers as well as unbilled amounts (contract assets) and are included in Receivables - net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n54\nAmounts are billed in accordance with contractual terms or as work progresses. Unbilled amounts arise when the timing of billing differs from the timing of revenue recognized, such as when contract provisions require specific milestones to be met before a customer can be billed. Unbilled amounts primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and the revenue recognized exceeds the amount billed to the customer as there is not yet a right to invoice in accordance with contractual terms. Unbilled amounts are recorded as a contract asset when the revenue associated with the contract is recognized prior to billing and derecognized when billed in accordance with the terms of the contract.\nThe composition of Customer receivables was as follows:\nAdvance payments, deposits and billings in excess of revenue recognized are included in Deferred revenue which is classified as current or noncurrent based on the timing of when the Company expects to recognize the revenue. The current portion is included in Accrued expenses and the noncurrent portion is included in Other noncurrent liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Advance payments and deposits represent contract liabilities and are recorded when customers remit contractual cash payments in advance of us satisfying performance obligations under contractual arrangements, including those with performance obligations satisfied over time. The Company generally receives advance payments from customers related to maintenance services which are recognized ratably over the service term. The Company also receives deposits from customers on certain orders which the Company recognizes as revenue at a point in time in the future. Billings in excess of revenue recognized represent contract liabilities and primarily relate to performance obligations satisfied over time when the cost-to-cost method is utilized and revenue cannot yet be recognized as the Company has not completed the corresponding performance obligation. Contract liabilities are derecognized when revenue is recognized and the performance obligation is satisfied.\nThe composition of Deferred revenue was as follows:\n55\n6.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for 2021 and 2020, by reportable business segment, were as follows:\nGoodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and was tested for impairment at each of the Company’s\n13\nreporting units as of October 31, 2021, the Company’s annual impairment test date. In assessing the fair value of the reporting units, the Company considers both the market approach and the income approach. Under the market approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined by the respective trailing 12 month EBITDA and the forward looking 2022 EBITDA (50% each), based on multiples of comparable public companies. The market approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including forecasted EBITDA and selected market multiples. Under the income approach, the fair value of the reporting unit is determined based on the present value of estimated future cash flows. The income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions including estimates of operating results, capital expenditures, net working capital requirements, long-term growth rates and discount rates. Weighting was equally attributed to both the market and the income approaches (50% each) in arriving at the fair value of the reporting units. In 2021 and 2020, there were no events or circumstances that would have required an interim impairment test.\nThe following table provides the gross carrying value and accumulated amortization for each major class of intangible asset at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n56\nThe Banjo trade name and the Akron Brass trade name are indefinite-lived intangible assets that were also tested for impairment as of October 31, 2021, the Company’s annual impairment test date. These indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment on an annual basis in accordance with ASC 350 or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired. The Company uses the relief-from-royalty method, a form of the income approach, to determine the fair value of these trade names. The relief-from-royalty method is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions, including estimates of revenues, royalty rates and discount rates. In 2021 and 2020, there were no events or circumstances that would have required an interim impairment test.\nRefer to\nfor discussion on impairment of definite-lived intangibles.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $\n56.4\nmillion, $\n41.8\nmillion and $\n37.3\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Based on the intangible asset balances as of December 31, 2021, amortization expense is expected to approximate $\n61.3\nmillion in 2022, $\n58.1\nmillion in 2023, $\n53.6\nmillion in 2024, $\n52.0\nmillion in 2025 and $\n50.2\nmillion in 2026.\n7.\nBorrowings\nBorrowings at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following:\nIssuance of\n2.625\n% Senior Notes in 2021\nOn May 28, 2021, the Company completed a public offering of $\n500.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of\n2.625\n% Senior Notes due June 2031 (the “\n2.625\n% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $\n494.7\nmillion, after deducting the issuance discount of $\n0.6\nmillion, the underwriting commission of $\n3.3\nmillion and offering expenses of $\n1.4\nmillion. The net proceeds were used to redeem and repay the $\n350.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its\n4.20\n% Senior Notes due December 15, 2021 (the “\n4.20\n% Senior Notes”) and a $\n6.7\nmillion make-whole redemption premium, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes. The\n2.625\n% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of\n2.625\n% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year. The\n2.625\n% Senior Notes mature on June 15, 2031. The\n2.625\n% Senior Notes were issued under an Indenture, dated as of December 6, 2010 (the “Base Indenture”), between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the “Trustee”), as supplemented by the Fourth Supplemental Indenture, dated as of May 28, 2021 (the “Supplemental Indenture” and, together with the Base Indenture and other supplements thereto, the “Indenture”), between the Company and the Trustee.\nThe Company may redeem all or a portion of the\n2.625\n% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture. The Indenture and the\n2.625\n% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens, enter into certain sale and leaseback transactions and enter into certain mergers, consolidations and transfers of substantially all of the Company’s assets. The terms of the\n2.625\n% Senior Notes also require the Company to make an offer to repurchase the\n2.625\n% Senior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to\n101\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any. The Indenture also provides for customary events of default, which include nonpayment, breach of covenants or warranties in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy, insolvency or reorganization. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least\n25\n% of the then outstanding\n2.625\n% Senior Notes may declare the principal amount of all of the\n2.625\n% Senior Notes to be due and payable immediately.\n57\nOn May 17, 2021, the Company provided notice of its election to redeem early, on June 16, 2021, the $\n350.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its\n4.20\n% Senior Notes at a redemption price of $\n350.0\nmillion plus a make-whole redemption premium of $\n6.7\nmillion using proceeds from the Company’s\n2.625\n% Senior Notes. In addition, the Company recognized the remaining $\n1.3\nmillion of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity related to the interest rate exchange agreement associated with the\n4.20\n% Senior Notes and wrote off the remaining $\n0.1\nmillion of deferred issuance costs and $\n0.1\nmillion of the debt issuance discount associated with the\n4.20\n% Senior Notes as well as $\n0.4\nmillion of deferred taxes for a total loss on early debt redemption of $\n8.6\nmillion which was recorded within Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nIssuance of\n3.00\n% Senior Notes in 2020\nOn April 29, 2020, the Company completed a public offering of $\n500.0\nmillion in aggregate principal amount of\n3.00\n% Senior Notes due May 2030 (the “\n3.00\n% Senior Notes”). The net proceeds from the offering were approximately $\n494.4\nmillion, after deducting the issuance discount of $\n0.9\nmillion, the underwriting commission of $\n3.3\nmillion and offering expenses of $\n1.4\nmillion. The net proceeds were used to redeem and repay the $\n300.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its\n4.50\n% Senior Notes due December 15, 2020 (the “\n4.50\n% Senior Notes”) and the related accrued interest and a make-whole redemption premium, with the remaining balance used for general corporate purposes. The\n3.00\n% Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of\n3.00\n% per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 1 and November 1 of each year. The\n3.00\n% Senior Notes mature on May 1, 2030.\nThe Company may redeem all or a portion of the\n3.00\n% Senior Notes at any time prior to maturity at the redemption prices set forth in the Indenture governing the\n3.00\n% Senior Notes. The Indenture and\n3.00\n% Senior Notes contain covenants that limit the Company’s ability to, among other things, incur certain liens securing indebtedness, engage in certain sale-leaseback transactions and enter into certain consolidations, mergers, conveyances, transfers or leases of all or substantially all of the Company’s assets. The terms of the\n3.00\n% Senior Notes also require\nthe Company to make an offer to repurchase the\n3.00\n%\nSenior Notes upon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the Indenture) at a price equal to\n101\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any.\nThe Indenture also provides for customary events of default,\nwhich include nonpayment, breach of covenants in the Indenture and certain events of bankruptcy and insolvency. Generally, if an event of default occurs, the Trustee or holders of at least\n25\n% of the then outstanding\n3.00\n%\nSenior Notes may declare the principal amount of all of the\n3.00\n%\nSenior Notes to be due and payable immediately.\nOn April 27, 2020, the Company provided notice of its election to redeem early, on May 27, 2020, the $\n300.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount outstanding of its\n4.50\n% Senior Notes at a redemption price of $\n300.0\nmillion plus a make-whole redemption premium of $\n6.8\nmillion and accrued and unpaid interest of $\n6.1\nmillion using proceeds from the Company’s\n3.00\n% Senior Notes. In addition, the Company recognized the remaining $\n1.4\nmillion of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity related to the interest rate exchange agreement associated with the\n4.50\n% Senior Notes and wrote off the remaining $\n0.1\nmillion of deferred issuance costs and $\n0.1\nmillion of the debt issuance discount associated with the\n4.50\n% Senior Notes for a total loss on early debt redemption of $\n8.4\nmillion which was recorded within Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nRevolving Credit Facility\nOn May 31, 2019, the Company entered into a credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) along with certain of its subsidiaries, as borrowers (the “Borrowers”), Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent, swing line lender and an issuer of letters of credit, with other agents party thereto.  The Credit Agreement consists of a revolving credit facility (the “Revolving Facility”) in an aggregate principal amount of $\n800\nmillion with a final maturity date of May 31, 2024. The maturity date may be extended under certain conditions for an additional\none\n-year term. Up to $\n75\nmillion of the Revolving Facility is available for the issuance of letters of credit. Additionally, up to $\n50\nmillion of the Revolving Facility is available to the Company for swing line loans, available on a same-day basis. The Credit Agreement replaced the Company’s prior\nfive\n-year $\n700\nmillion credit agreement, dated as of June 23, 2015, which was due to expire in June 2020.\nProceeds of the Revolving Facility are available for use by the Borrowers for acquisitions, working capital and other general corporate purposes, including refinancing existing debt of the Company and its subsidiaries. The Company may request increases in the lending commitments under the Credit Agreement, but the aggregate lending commitments pursuant to such increases may not exceed $\n400\nmillion. The Company has the right, subject to certain conditions set forth in the Credit Agreement, to designate certain foreign subsidiaries of the Company as borrowers under the Credit Agreement. In connection with any such designation, the Company is required to guarantee the obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Credit Agreement.\n58\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at either an alternate base rate or adjusted LIBOR plus, in each case, an applicable margin. Such applicable margin is based on the lower of the Company’s senior, unsecured, long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio and can range from\n0.00\n% to\n1.275\n%. Interest is payable (a) in the case of base rate loans, quarterly, and (b) in the case of LIBOR loans, on the last day of the applicable interest period selected, or every three months from the effective date of such interest period for interest periods exceeding three months.\nThe Credit Agreement requires payment to the lenders of a facility fee based upon the amount of the lenders’ commitments under the credit facility from time to time, determined based on the lower of the Company’s senior, unsecured long-term debt rating or the Company’s applicable leverage ratio. Voluntary prepayments of any loans and voluntary reductions of the unutilized portion of the commitments under the Credit Agreement are permissible without penalty, subject to break funding payments and minimum notice and minimum reduction amount requirements.\nThe Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for senior unsecured credit agreements. There are two key financial covenants that the Company is required to maintain in connection with the Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, excluding the\n3.00\n% Senior Notes which have no financial covenants, a minimum interest coverage ratio of\n3.0\nto 1 and a maximum leverage ratio of\n3.50\nto 1, which is the ratio of the Company’s consolidated total debt to its consolidated earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”), both of which are tested quarterly and in the case of the leverage ratio under the Revolving Facility, there is an option to increase the ratio to\n4.00\nfor 12 months in connection with certain acquisitions. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with each financial covenant under Credit Agreement and the Senior Notes, excluding the\n3.00\n% Senior Notes which have no financial covenants. While there are no financial covenants relating to the\n3.00\n% Senior Notes, they are subject to cross-default provisions. The negative covenants include restrictions on the Company’s ability to grant liens, enter into transactions resulting in fundamental changes (such as mergers or sales of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company), make certain subsidiary dividends or distributions, engage in materially different lines of businesses and allow subsidiaries to incur certain additional debt.\nThe Credit Agreement also contains customary events of default (subject to grace periods, as appropriate).\nAt December 31, 2021, there was\nno\nbalance outstanding under the Revolving Facility and $\n7.2\nmillion of outstanding letters of credit, resulting in a net available borrowing capacity under the Revolving Facility at December 31, 2021 of approximately $\n792.8\nmillion. In addition, there were\nno\nborrowings under the Revolving Facility during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nIssuance of\n3.20\n% Senior Notes and\n3.37\n% Senior Notes in 2016\nOn June 13, 2016, the Company completed a private placement of a $\n100\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n3.20\n% Senior Notes due June 13, 2023 (the “\n3.20\n% Senior Notes”) and a $\n100\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n3.37\n% Senior Notes due June 13, 2025 (the “\n3.37\n% Senior Notes” and together with the\n3.20\n% Senior Notes, the “2016 Private Placement Notes”) pursuant to a Note Purchase Agreement dated June 13, 2016 (the “Purchase Agreement”). Each series of the 2016 Private Placement Notes bears interest at the stated amount per annum, which is payable semi-annually in arrears on each June 13\nth\nand December 13\nth\n. The 2016 Private Placement Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank pari passu in right of payment with all of the Company’s other unsecured, unsubordinated debt. The Company may at any time prepay all, or any portion of the 2016 Private Placement Notes, provided that such portion is greater than\n5\n% of the aggregate principal amount of the 2016 Private Placement Notes then outstanding. In the event of a prepayment, the Company will pay an amount equal to par plus accrued interest plus a make-whole amount. In addition, the Company may repurchase the 2016 Private Placement Notes by making an offer to all holders of the 2016 Private Placement Notes, subject to certain conditions.\nThe Purchase Agreement contains certain covenants that restrict the Company’s ability to, among other things, transfer or sell assets, incur indebtedness, create liens, transact with affiliates and engage in certain mergers or consolidations or other change of control transactions. In addition, the Company must comply with the leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio  described above and the Purchase Agreement also limits the outstanding principal amount of priority debt that may be incurred by the Company to\n15\n% of consolidated assets. The Purchase Agreement provides for customary events of default. In the case of an event of default arising from specified events of bankruptcy or insolvency, all of the outstanding 2016 Private Placement Notes will become due and payable immediately without further action or notice. In the case of payment event of default, any holder of the 2016 Private Placement Notes affected thereby may declare all of the 2016 Private Placement Notes held by it due and payable immediately. In the case of any other event of default, a majority of the holders of the 2016 Private Placement Notes may declare all of the 2016 Private Placement Notes to be due and payable immediately.\n59\nTotal borrowings at December 31, 2021 have scheduled maturities as follows:\n8.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe Company enters into cash flow hedges from time to time to reduce the exposure to variability in certain expected future cash flows. The types of cash flow hedges the Company enters into include foreign currency exchange contracts designed to minimize the earnings impact on certain intercompany loans as well as interest rate exchange agreements designed to reduce the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense that effectively convert a portion of floating-rate debt to fixed-rate debt.\nThe effective portion of gains or losses on interest rate exchange agreements is reported in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into net income in the same period or periods in which the hedged transaction affects net income. The remaining gain or loss in excess of the cumulative change in the present value of future cash flows or the hedged item, if any, is recognized in net income during the period of change. See\nfor the amount of loss reclassified into net income for interest rate contracts for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2021, the Company did not have any interest rate contracts outstanding.\nIn 2010 and 2011, the Company entered into\ntwo\nseparate forward starting interest rate exchange agreements in anticipation of the issuance of the\n4.50\n% Senior Notes and the\n4.20\n% Senior Notes. The Company cash settled these two interest rate contracts in 2010 and 2011 for a total of $\n68.9\nmillion, which was being amortized into interest expense over the\n10\nyear terms of the respective debt instruments. In conjunction with the early redemption of the\n4.50\n% Senior Notes on May 27, 2020, the Company accelerated the recognition of the remaining $\n1.4\nmillion of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity related to the\n4.50\n% Senior Notes and recorded such as Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2020. In conjunction with the early redemption of the\n4.20\n% Senior Notes on June 16, 2021, the Company accelerated the recognition of the remaining $\n1.3\nmillion of the pre-tax amount included in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in shareholders’ equity related to the\n4.20\n% Senior Notes and recorded such as Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, there was no balance in Accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the cumulative unrealized gain (loss) on derivatives.\nThe amount of expense reclassified into interest expense for interest rate contracts for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is $\n3.3\nmillion, $\n6.0\nmillion and $\n6.3\nmillion, respectively.\n9.\nFair Value Measurements\nASC 820,\nFair Value Measurements and Disclosures,\ndefines fair value, provides guidance for measuring fair value and requires certain disclosures. This standard discusses valuation techniques, such as the market approach (comparable market prices), the income approach (present value of future income or cash flow) and the cost approach (cost to replace the service capacity of an asset or replacement cost). The standard utilizes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad levels. The following is a brief description of those three levels:\n•\nLevel 1:  Observable inputs such as quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2: Inputs, other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. These include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets and quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active.\n•\nLevel 3:  Unobservable inputs that reflect the reporting entity’s own assumptions.\n60\nThe following table summarizes the basis used to measure the Company’s financial assets (liabilities) at fair value on a recurring basis in the balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n(1)\nThe Supplemental Executive Retirement Plan (“SERP”) investment assets are offset by a SERP liability which represents the Company’s obligation to distribute SERP funds to participants.\n(2)\nAt December 31, 2021, t\nhe securities are included in Other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and are available for overnight cash settlement, if necessary, to fund current operations.\nThere were\nno\ntransfers of assets or liabilities between Level 1 and Level 2 in 2021 or 2020.\nThe carrying values of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, marketable securities, accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value because of the short term nature of these instruments. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the outstanding indebtedness described in Footnote 7 based on quoted market prices and current market rates for debt with similar credit risk and maturity was approximately $\n1,219.9\nmillion and $\n1,127.6\nmillion, respectively, compared to the carrying value of $\n1,198.7\nmillion and $\n1,049.3\nmillion, respectively. These fair value measurements are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy since they are determined based upon significant inputs observable in the market, including interest rates on recent financing transactions to entities with a credit rating similar to the Company’s rating.\n10.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain office facilities, warehouses, manufacturing plants, equipment (which includes both office and plant equipment) and vehicles under operating leases. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; the Company recognizes lease expense for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nCertain leases include\none\nor more options to renew. The exercise of lease renewal options is at the Company’s sole discretion. The Company does not include renewal periods in any of the leases’ terms until the renewal is executed as they are generally not reasonably certain of being exercised. The Company does not have any material purchase options.\nCertain of the Company’s lease agreements have rental payments that are adjusted periodically for inflation or that are based on usage. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\n61\nSupplemental balance sheet information related to leases as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nRefer to\nfor discussion on impairment of building right-of-use assets.\nThe components of lease cost for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n(1)\nIncludes short-term leases, which are immaterial.\nSupplemental cash flow information related to leases for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nOther supplemental information related to leases as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nThe Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to determine the present value of the lease payments.\n62\nTotal lease liabilities at December 31, 2021 have scheduled maturities as follows:\nTotal lease liabilities at December 31, 2020 had scheduled maturities as follows:\n63\n11.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nWarranty costs are provided for at the time of sale. The warranty provision is based on historical costs and adjusted for specific known claims.\nA rollforward of the warranty reserve is as follows:\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries are involved in pending and threatened legal, regulatory and other proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business. These proceedings may pertain to matters such as product liability or contract disputes, and may also involve governmental inquiries, inspections, audits or investigations relating to issues such as tax matters, intellectual property, environmental, health and safety issues, governmental regulations, employment and other matters. Although the results of such legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty, the Company believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect, individually or in the aggregate, on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\n12.\nCommon and Preferred Stock\nOn March 17, 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved an increase of $\n500.0\nmillion in the authorized level of repurchases of common stock. This approval is in addition to the prior repurchase authorizations of the Board of Directors of $\n300.0\nmillion on December 1, 2015. These authorizations have no expiration date. Repurchases under the program will be funded with future cash flow generation or borrowings available under the Revolving Facility. There were\nno\nshare repurchases during 2021. During 2020, the Company repurchased a total of\n0.9\nmillion shares at a cost of $\n110.3\nmillion. As of December 31, 2021, the amount of share repurchase authorization remaining was $\n712.0\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had\n150\nmillion shares of authorized common stock, with a par value of              $\n.01\nper share, and\nfive million\nshares of authorized preferred stock, with a par value of $\n.01\nper share.\nNo\npreferred stock was outstanding at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n13.\nIncome Taxes\nPretax income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was taxed in the following jurisdictions:\n64\nThe provision (benefit) for income taxes for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nDeferred tax assets (liabilities) at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were:\nThe deferred tax assets and liabilities recognized in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were:\nThe Company had prepaid income taxes, recorded within Other current assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, of $\n9.1\nmillion and $\n20.9\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n65\nThe provision for income taxes differs from the amount calculated by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pretax income. The calculated amount and the differences for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the following table:\nThe Company has $\n40.6\nmillion and $\n28.6\nmillion of permanently reinvested earnings of non-U.S. subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. No deferred U.S. income taxes have been provided on the $\n40.6\nmillion of earnings that are considered to be permanently reinvested. It should also be noted that the aforementioned earnings will not incur U.S. taxes when ultimately repatriated other than potentially U.S. federal, state and local taxes on foreign exchange gains or losses recognized on the distribution of such earnings. Such distributions could also be subject to additional foreign withholding and foreign income taxes. The amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liabilities on currently permanently reinvested earnings is estimated to be $\n6.1\nmillion and $\n4.3\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company repatriated $\n116.0\nmillion, $\n27.0\nmillion and $\n99.0\nmillion of foreign earnings, respectively. These actual distributions resulted in\nno\nincremental income tax expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. These repatriations represent distributions of previously taxed income as well as distributions from liquidating subsidiaries.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in provision for income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Income. As of December 31, 2021, the Company accrued interest and penalties of less than $\n0.1\nmillion related to uncertain tax positions.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would affect the Company’s effective tax rate if recognized is $\n0.1\nmillion, $\n1.1\nmillion and $\n3.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The tax years 2016-2020 remain open to examination by major taxing jurisdictions. Due to the potential for resolution of federal, state and foreign examinations, and the expiration of various statutes of limitation, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s gross unrecognized tax benefits balance may change. However, these unrecognized tax benefits are long-term in nature and are not expected to change within the next 12 months.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had non-U.S. and U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards of $\n0.7\nmillion and $\n22.5\nmillion, respectively. The entire balance of the non-U.S. net operating losses, the majority of which relates to acquisitions\n66\nis available to be carried forward indefinitely. The U.S. state net operating loss will expire between 2033 and 2040. There is no valuation allowance as it is more-likely-than-not that the net operating losses will be realized.\nThe Company has U.S. federal, U.S. state and non-U.S. capital loss carryforwards of $\n11.9\nmillion, $\n11.9\nmillion and $\n13.5\nmillion, respectively, with a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. The non-U.S. capital loss can be carried forward indefinitely. The U.S. federal and U.S. state capital loss carryforwards will expire at various dates between 2025 and 2040.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has a foreign tax credit carryforward for U.S. federal purposes of approximately $\n6.6\nmillion with a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset. The U.S. federal foreign tax credit carryover will expire between 2029 and 2031.\n14.\nBusiness Segments and Geographic Information\nIDEX has\nthree\nreportable business segments: FMT, HST and FSDP.\nThe FMT segment designs, produces and distributes positive displacement pumps, valves, small volume provers, flow meters, injectors and other fluid-handling pump modules and systems and provides flow monitoring and other services for the food, chemical, general industrial, water and wastewater, agriculture and energy industries.\nThe HST segment designs, produces and distributes a wide range of precision fluidics, rotary lobe pumps, centrifugal and positive displacement pumps, roll compaction and drying systems, pneumatic components and sealing solutions, high performance molded and extruded sealing components, custom mechanical and shaft seals, engineered hygienic mixers and valves, biocompatible medical devices and implantables, air compressors and blowers, optical components and coatings, laboratory and commercial equipment, precision photonic solutions and precision gear and peristaltic pump technologies.

Intersegment sales are accounted for at fair value as if the sales were to third parties.\n67\n68\n(1)\nSegment operating income (loss) excludes net unallocated corporate operating expenses.\n(2)\nExcludes amortization of debt issuance expenses.\nInformation about the Company’s long-lived assets in different geographical regions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is shown below.\n69\n15.\nRestructuring Expenses and Asset Impairments\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred restructuring expenses and asset impairments of $\n9.3\nmillion, $\n11.8\nmillion and $\n21.0\nmillion, respectively. These costs were incurred to facilitate long-term sustainable growth through cost reduction actions, consisting of employee reductions, facility rationalization, contract termination costs and asset impairments. Restructuring costs include severance benefits, exit costs and asset impairments and are included in Restructuring expenses and asset impairments in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Severance costs primarily consist of severance benefits through payroll continuation, COBRA subsidies, outplacement services, conditional separation costs and employer tax liabilities, while exit costs primarily consist of lease exit and contract termination costs.\n2021 Initiative\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company incurred severance costs related to employee reductions. In addition, the Company consolidated certain facilities within the FMT segment which resulted in asset impairments of $\n0.8\nmillion related to property, plant and equipment that was not relocated to the new locations.\nPre-tax restructuring expenses and asset impairments by segment for the 2021 initiative were as follows:\n2020 Initiative\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company incurred severance costs related to employee reductions and exit costs related to early lease terminations. In addition, in the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company consolidated certain facilities within the FMT segment, which resulted in an impairment charge of $\n2.5\nmillion. The Company also relocated its corporate office, which resulted in an impairment charge of $\n0.6\nmillion.\nPre-tax restructuring expenses and asset impairments by segment for the 2020 initiative were as follows:\n2019 Initiative\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company incurred severance costs related to employee reductions and exit costs related to early lease terminations. In addition, in the second quarter of 2019, the Company began to evaluate strategic alternatives for one of its businesses in the HST segment. Prior to making a final decision on the options that were presented for this business, the business was informed of the loss of its largest customer. As a result, the Company accelerated its restructuring activities for this business and a decision was made to wind down the business over time. This event required an interim impairment test be performed on the long-lived tangible and intangible assets of the business, which resulted in an impairment charge of $\n9.7\nmillion. The Company also consolidated one of its facilities into the Optics Center of Excellence in Rochester, New York, which resulted in an impairment charge of $\n0.4\nmillion related to a building right-of-use asset.\n70\nPre-tax restructuring expenses and asset impairments by segment for the 2019 initiative were as follows:\nRestructuring accruals reflected in Accrued expenses in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets are as follows:\n(1)\nExcludes $\n2.9\nmillion of asset impairments related to property, plant and equipment and right-of-use assets.\n(2)\nExcludes $\n0.8\nmillion of asset impairments related to property, plant and equipment.\n16.\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company maintains\ntwo\nshare-based compensation plans for executives, non-employee directors and certain key employees that authorize the granting of stock options, restricted stock, performance share units and other types of awards consistent with the purpose of the plans. The number of shares authorized for issuance under the Company’s plans as of December 31, 2021 totaled\n15.6\nmillion, of which\n2.4\nmillion shares were available for future issuance. The Company’s policy is to recognize compensation cost on a straight-line basis, assuming forfeitures, over the requisite service period for the entire award.\nThe Company typically grants equity awards annually at its regularly scheduled first quarter meeting of the Board of Directors based on the recommendation from the Compensation Committee.\nStock Options\nStock options granted under the Company’s plans are generally non-qualified and are granted\nwith an exercise price equal to the market price of the Company’s stock on the date of grant. The fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of the grant using the Binomial lattice option pricing model (for options granted before March 2021) or the Black Scholes valuation model (for options granted after February 2021). The adoption of the Black Scholes model in 2021 was driven by a historical review of option exercise history, which more closely aligned with the methodology of the Black Scholes model. The majority of the options issued to employees vest ratably over\nfour years\n, with vesting beginning one year from the date of grant, and generally expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant.\n71\nWeighted average option fair values and assumptions for the periods specified are as follows:\nThe assumptions are as follows:\n•\nThe Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the contractual term of the option (for the Binomial lattice option pricing model) or over the expected life of the option (for the Black Scholes valuation model).\n•\nThe Company uses historical data to estimate the expected life of the option. The expected life assumption for options granted before March 2021 is an output of the Binomial lattice option pricing model, which incorporates vesting provisions, rate of voluntary exercise and rate of post-vesting termination over the contractual life of the option to define expected employee behavior. The expected life assumption for options granted after March 2021 is based on IDEX’s own exercise and cancellation history, adjusted for current vesting schedules.\n•\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods within the contractual life of the option (for the Binomial lattice option pricing model) or commensurate with the expected life of the option (for the Black Scholes valuation model). For options granted before March 2021, the Company presents the range of risk-free one-year forward rates, derived from the U.S. treasury yield curve, utilized in the Binomial lattice option pricing model. For options granted after March 2021, the Company presents the spot rate used in the Black Scholes valuation model.\n•\nThe expected dividend yield is based on the Company’s current dividend yield as the best estimate of projected dividend yield for periods within the contractual life of the option.\nA summary of the Company’s stock option activity as of December 31, 2021, and changes during the year ended December 31, 2021 is presented as follows:\nThe intrinsic value for stock options outstanding and exercisable is defined as the difference between the market value of the Company’s common stock as of the end of the period and the grant price. The total intrinsic value of options exercised in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n21.4\nmillion, $\n41.3\nmillion and $\n49.5\nmillion, respectively. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, cash received from options exercised was $\n19.7\nmillion, $\n44.6\nmillion and $\n38.8\nmillion, respectively, while the actual tax benefit realized for the tax deductions from stock options exercised totaled $\n4.5\nmillion, $\n8.7\nmillion and $\n10.4\nmillion, respectively.\n72\nTotal compensation cost for stock options is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $\n9.7\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to stock options that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.2\nyears.\nRestricted Stock\nRestricted stock awards generally cliff vest after\nthree years\nfor employees and non-employee directors. Unvested restricted stock carries dividend and voting rights and the sale of the shares is restricted prior to the date of vesting. Dividends are paid on restricted stock awards and their fair value is equal to the market price of the Company’s stock at the date of the grant.\nA summary of the Company’s restricted stock activity as of December 31, 2021, and changes during the year ending December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nTotal compensation cost for restricted stock is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $\n6.8\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.0\nyear.\nCash-Settled Restricted Stock\nThe Company also maintains a cash-settled share based compensation plan for certain employees. Cash-settled restricted stock awards generally cliff vest after\nthree years\n. Cash-settled restricted stock awards are recorded at fair value on a quarterly basis using the market price of the Company’s stock on the last day of the quarter. Dividend equivalents are paid on certain cash-settled restricted stock awards.\nA summary of the Company’s unvested cash-settled restricted stock activity as of December 31, 2021, and changes during the year ending December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n73\nTotal compensation cost for cash-settled restricted stock is recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Income as follows:\n(1)\nThe 2020 and 2019 amounts were previously included in Share-based compensation expense on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These amounts have been reclassified to Accrued expenses and Other-net such that the amounts presented in Share-based compensation expense on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows relate solely to non-cash awards for all years presented. There was no change to the reported amount of net cash flows provided by operating activities for either 2020 or 2019 as a result of the reclassification.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has accrued $\n5.9\nmillion and $\n5.4\nmillion, respectively, for cash-settled restricted stock in Accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and has accrued $\n2.8\nmillion and $\n2.9\nmillion, respectively, for cash-settled restricted stock in Other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nPerformance Share Units\nBeginning in 2013, the Company granted performance share units to selected key employees that may be earned based on IDEX total shareholder return over the three-year period following the date of grant. Performance share units are expected to be made annually and are paid out at the end of a\nthree\n-year period based on the Company’s performance. Performance is measured by determining the percentile rank of the total shareholder return of IDEX common stock in relation to the total shareholder return of companies in the Russell Midcap Index (for awards granted from 2016 through 2019) or the S&P 500 Index (for awards granted in 2020 and 2021) for the three-year period following the date of grant. The payment of awards following the three-year award period will be based on performance achieved in accordance with the scale set forth in the plan agreement and may range from\n0\npercent to\n250\npercent of the initial grant. A target payout of\n100\npercent is earned if total shareholder return is equal to the 50\nth\npercentile of the peer group. Performance share units earn dividend equivalents for the award period, which will be paid to participants with the award payout at the end of the period based on the actual number of performance share units that are earned. Payments made at the end of the award period will be in the form of stock for performance share units and will be in cash for dividend equivalents. The Company’s performance share units are market condition awards, have been assessed at fair value on the date of grant using a Monte Carlo simulation model and are expensed ratably over the three-year term of the awards. The Company granted\n29,020\n,\n42,690\nand\n56,860\nperformance share units in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n74\nWeighted average performance share unit fair values and assumptions for the period specified are as follows:\nThe assumptions are as follows:\n•\nThe Company estimated volatility using its historical share price performance over the remaining performance period as of the grant date.\n•\nThe Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model that uses an expected life commensurate with the performance period. As a result, the expected life of the performance share units was assumed to be the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period.\n•\nThe risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant with a term commensurate with the remaining performance period.\n•\nTotal Shareholder Return is determined assuming that dividends are reinvested in the issuing entity over the performance period, which is mathematically equivalent to utilizing a\n0\n% dividend yield.\nA summary of the Company’s performance share unit activity as of December 31, 2021, and changes during the year ending December 31, 2021, is as follows:\nBased on the Company’s relative total shareholder return rank during the three year period ended December 31, 2021, the Company achieved a\n143\n% payout factor and issued\n42,688\ncommon shares in February 2022 for awards that vested in 2021.\nTotal compensation cost for performance share units is as follows:\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $\n4.7\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to performance shares that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n0.8\nyears.\n75\n17.\nOther Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nThe components of Other comprehensive (loss) income are as follows:\nThe a\nmounts reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income to net income are summarized as follows:\n18.\nRetirement Benefits\nThe Company sponsors several qualified and nonqualified defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans as well as other post-retirement plans for its employees. The Company uses a measurement date of December 31 for its defined benefit\n76\npension plans and post-retirement medical plans. The Company employs the measurement date provisions of ASC 715,\nCompensation-Retirement Benefits\n, which require the measurement date of plan assets and liabilities to coincide with the sponsor’s year end.\nEffective September 30, 2019, the IDEX Corporation Retirement Plan (“Plan”), a U.S. defined benefit plan, was amended to freeze the accrual of retirement benefits for all participants. This action impacted fewer than\n60\nparticipants, as the Plan had been closed to new entrants as of December 31, 2004 and frozen as of December 31, 2005 for all but certain older, longer service participants. Subsequent to the freeze, termination of the Plan was approved in November 2019. In addition, the Company recorded a settlement charge of $\n0.7\nmillion in Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nParticipants were notified in February 2020 and the Plan was terminated in May 2020. As a result of the termination, the settlement threshold was reached in early 2020 and the Company recorded a settlement charge of $\n0.9\nmillion in Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020. The settlement also triggered the remeasurement of net periodic benefit cost resulting in a reduction of $\n1.0\nmillion to Other expense - net in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2020 as a result of significant decreases in discount rates and strong asset performance in 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company settled its remaining obligations under the U.S. pension plan through a combination of lump-sum payments to eligible participants who elected them, and through the purchase of annuities from Legal and General, an A rated third-party insurer. The Company recognized a net loss of $\n9.7\nmillion, which was recorded within Other expense - net. The net loss consisted of $\n10.7\nmillion related to previously deferred pension related costs, partially offset by $\n1.0\nmillion related to an increase in plan assets remaining after the settlement. As of December 31, 2021, the Plan had surplus plan assets of approximately $\n10.2\nmillion, representing cash equivalents held in a trust. These plan assets are included in Other current assets on the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be used to fund the Company’s other retirement benefit plans over the next twelve months.\n77\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the changes in the benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets over the two-year period ended December 31, 2021 and a statement of the funded status at December 31 for both years.\nThe pension benefits actuarial gain in 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in the discount rates from 2020 to 2021. The U.S. actuarial gain was partially offset by an updated projection scale assumption. The non-U.S. actuarial gain was primarily driven by the increase in the discount rates, asset gains and the updated mortality assumptions in Switzerland.\nThe other benefits actuarial gain in 2021 was primarily driven by the increase in the discount rates from 2020 to 2021 and gains from updated participant data, partially offset by updated claims and contributions experience.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n110.7\nmillion and $\n204.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n78\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the measurement of the Company’s benefit obligation at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nThe pretax amounts recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nThe components of the net periodic (benefit) cost for the plans in 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe Company recognizes the service cost component in both Selling, general and administrative expenses and Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income depending on the functional area of the underlying employees included in the plans.\n79\nThe assumptions used in determining the net periodic cost (benefit) were as follows:\n*For the IDEX Corporation Retirement Plan, a discount rate of\n3.07\n% was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period January 1, 2020 through March 31, 2020, a discount rate of\n2.97\n% was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period April 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020, a discount rate of\n2.41\n% was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period July 1, 2020 through September 30, 2020 and a discount rate of\n2.36\n% was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period October 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 as a result of the quarterly remeasurements that occurred in conjunction with the termination of the Plan.\nFor the Pulsafeeder, Inc. Pension Plan for Hourly Employees at Rochester, New York, a discount rate of\n3.21\n% was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period January 1, 2020 through June 30, 2020 and a discount rate of\n2.62\n% was used to determine the net periodic (benefit) cost for the period July 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020 as a result of the remeasurement that occurred in conjunction with the ratification of the collective bargaining agreement.\n**A discount rate of\n4.11\n% was used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the period January 1, 2019 through August 31, 2019 and a discount rate of\n2.99\n% was used to determine the net periodic benefit cost for the period September 1, 2019 through December 31, 2019 as a result of the remeasurement that occurred in conjunction with the decision to freeze the Plan.\nThe pretax change recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheet in 2021 is as follows:\nThe discount rates for the Company’s plans are derived by matching the plan’s cash flows to a yield curve that provides the equivalent yields on zero-coupon bonds for each maturity. The discount rate selected is the rate that produces the same present value of cash flows.\nIn selecting the expected rate of return on plan assets, the Company considers the historical returns and expected returns on plan assets. The expected returns are evaluated using asset return class, variance and correlation assumptions based on the plan’s target asset allocation and current market conditions.\n80\nPrior service costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period of active participants. Gains and losses in excess of\n10\n% of the greater of the benefit obligation or the market value of assets are amortized over the average remaining service period of active participants.\nCosts of defined contribution plans were $\n12.8\nmillion, $\n12.5\nmillion and $\n12.4\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company, through its subsidiaries, participates in certain multi-employer pension plans covering approximately\n212\nparticipants under U.S. collective bargaining agreements. None of these plans are considered individually significant to the Company as contributions to these plans totaled $\n1.0\nmillion, $\n1.1\nmillion, and $\n1.1\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nFor measurement purposes, a\n5.45\n% weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for 2021. The rate was assumed to decrease gradually each year to a rate of\n4.45\n% for\n2040\n, and remain at that level thereafter.\nPlan Assets\nThe Company’s pension plan weighted average asset allocations at December 31, 2021 and 2020, by asset category, were as follows:\nThe basis used to measure the defined benefit plans’ assets at fair value at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is summarized as follows:\n(1)\nOther commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments in non-U.S. plans.\n81\n(1)\nOther commingled funds represent pooled institutional investments in non-U.S. plans.\nEquities that are valued using quoted prices are valued at the published market prices. Equities in a common collective trust or a registered investment company that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the fund administrator. The NAV is based on the value of the underlying assets owned by the fund minus its liabilities. Fixed income securities that are valued using significant other observable inputs are valued at prices obtained from independent financial service industry-recognized vendors.\nInvestment Policies and Strategies\nThe investment objective of the U.S. plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn the highest possible total rate of return consistent with the plan’s tolerance for risk. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that “equities” will constitute\n10\n% and “fixed income” obligations, including cash, will constitute\n90\n% of the market value of total fund assets.\nThe investment objective of the UK plan, consistent with prudent standards for preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity, is to earn a target return of UK Gilts plus approximately\n3.1\n% per year. The general asset allocation guidelines for plan assets are that “equities” will constitute from\n60\n% to\n65\n% of the market value of total fund assets with a target of\n62\n%, and “fixed income” obligations, including cash, will constitute from\n35\n% to\n40\n% with a target of\n38\n%. The UK plan also has a framework in place such that if the funding position (which is monitored daily) improves to a certain level, the asset allocation will switch out of equities into fixed income assets in order to lower the level of risk of the investments.\nThe term “equities” includes common stock, while the term “fixed income” includes obligations with contractual payments and a specific maturity date. The Company, through the use of a professional independent advisor, will monitor the asset allocation daily and maintain an asset allocation that closely replicates the designated targets. Diversification of assets is employed to ensure that adverse performance of one security or security class does not have an undue detrimental impact on the portfolio as a whole. Diversification is interpreted to include diversification by type, characteristic and number of investments as well as by investment style of designated investment fund managers. No restrictions are placed on the selection of individual investments by the investment fund managers. The total fund performance and the performance of the investment fund managers is reviewed on a regular basis using an appointed professional independent advisor. As of December 31, 2021, there were\nno\nshares of the Company’s stock held in plan assets.\nCash Flows\nThe Company expects to contribute approximately $\n4.0\nmillion to its defined benefit plans and $\n1.2\nmillion to its other postretirement benefit plans in 2022. The Company also expects to contribute approximately $\n15.1\nmillion to its defined contribution plan and $\n10.2\nmillion to its 401(k) savings plan in 2022 using both the $\n10.2\nmillion of surplus plan assets described above and cash on hand.\n82\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe future estimated benefit payments for the next five years and the five years thereafter are as follows: 2022 — $\n6.4\nmillion; 2023 — $\n6.0\nmillion; 2024 — $\n6.0\nmillion; 2025 — $\n6.3\nmillion; 2026 — $\n6.3\nmillion; 2027 to 2031 — $\n31.8\nmillion.\n19.\nSubsequent Events\nAs previously announced, on November 23, 2021, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Nexsight, LLC and its businesses Envirosight, WinCan, MyTana and Pipeline Renewal Technologies (“Nexsight”) for cash consideration of $\n120.0\nmillion, subject to customary post-closing adjustments. Nexsight is based in Randolph, New Jersey. Nexsight will complement and  create synergies with the Company’s existing iPEK and ADS business units that design and create sewer crawlers, inspection and monitoring systems and software applications that allow teams to identify, anticipate and correct wastewater system issues remotely. Nexsight will be part of the Company’s Water reporting unit within the FMT segment.\nThe Company expects to close the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2022, subject to regulatory approval and customary closing conditions.\n83"
