    "text": "General Information\nLowe’s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company or Lowe’s) is a Fortune\n®\n50 company and the world’s second largest home improvement retailer.  As of January 28, 2022, Lowe’s operated 1,971 home improvement and hardware stores, representing approximately 208 million square feet of retail selling space.  These operations included 1,737 stores located across 50 U.S. states, as well as 234 stores in Canada.\nThe Canadian stores include RONA inc. (RONA), which was acquired by Lowe’s in 2016.  RONA operates 173 stores in Canada as of January 28, 2022, as well as services 226 dealer-owned stores.  The RONA stores represent complementary store formats operating under various banners.\nLowe’s was founded in 1921 with the opening of its first hardware store in North Wilkesboro, North Carolina.  The Company was incorporated in North Carolina in 1952 and has been publicly held since 1961.  The Company’s common stock is listed on the New York Stock Exchange - ticker symbol “LOW”.\nFor additional information about the Company’s performance and financial condition, see\n, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report.\nCustomers, Market and Competition\nOur Customers\nWe serve homeowners, renters, and professional customers (Pro customers).  Individual homeowners and renters complete a wide array of projects and vary along the spectrum of do-it-yourself (DIY) and do-it-for-me (DIFM).  The Pro customer consists of two broad categories: construction trades and maintenance, repair and operations.\nOur Market\nThe U.S. market remains our predominant market, accounting for approximately 94% of consolidated sales for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022.  The market in which we operate includes home-related sales through a variety of types of businesses.  This includes home centers, paint stores, hardware stores, lumber yards and garden centers, mass retailers, home goods specialty stores, and online retailers, as well as wholesalers that provide home-related products and services to homeowners, renters, businesses, and the government.\nThere are many variables that affect consumer demand for the home improvement products and services Lowe’s offers.  Key indicators we monitor include real disposable personal income, employment, home prices, housing turnover, and consumer mobility.  We also monitor demographic and societal trends that shape home improvement industry growth.\nOur Competition\nThe home improvement industry includes a broad competitive landscape that continues to evolve.  Lowe’s competes with national and international home improvement warehouse chains and lumber yards in most of the markets we serve.  We also compete with traditional hardware, plumbing, electrical, home supply retailers, and maintenance and repair organizations.  In addition, we compete with general merchandise retailers, warehouse clubs, online retailers, other specialty retailers, providers of equipment and tool rental, as well as service providers that install home improvement products.  Location of stores, product assortment, product pricing and customer service continue to be key competitive factors in our industry, while the evolution of technology and customer expectations also underscores the importance of omnichannel capabilities as a competitive factor.  To ensure ongoing competitiveness, Lowe’s focuses on delivering the right home improvement products, with the best service and value, across every channel and community we serve.  See further discussion of competition in\n, “Risk Factors”, of this Annual Report.\nProducts and Services\nOur products and services provide the retail and Pro customer a one-stop shop for a full complement of merchandise and services to complete home improvement, repair, maintenance, or construction projects, enabling a Total Home solution for every need in the home.\nOur Products\nProduct Selection\nTo meet customers’ varying needs, we offer a complete line of products for construction, maintenance, repair, remodeling, and decorating.  We offer home improvement products in the following categories: Appliances, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, Lawn & Garden, Lumber, Kitchens & Bath, Tools, Paint, Millwork, Hardware, Flooring, Rough Plumbing, Building Materials, Décor, Lighting, and Electrical.  A typical Lowe’s-branded home improvement store stocks approximately 40,000 items, with over two million additional items available through our online selling channels.  See\nof the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in\n, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report for historical revenues by product category for each of the last three fiscal years.\nWe are committed to offering a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise complemented by our selection of private brands.  In addition, we are dedicated to ensuring the products we sell are sourced in a socially responsible, efficient, and cost-effective manner.\nNational Brand-Name Merchandise\nIn many product categories, customers look for a familiar and trusted national brand to instill confidence in their purchase.  Lowe’s home improvement stores carry a wide selection of national brand-name merchandise such as GE\n®\n, LG\n®\n, Samsung\n®\n, and Whirlpool\n®\nappliances; Sherwin-Williams\n®\nand Valspar\n®\npaints and stains; LARSON\n®\nwindows and doors; Pergo\n®\nand SMARTCORE\n®\nflooring; CRAFTSMAN\n®\nand DeWalt\n®\npower tools; Metabo\n®\npneumatic tools; Weber\n®\nand Char-Broil\n®\ngrills; Owens Corning\n®\ninsulation and roofing; GAF\n®\nroofing; Marshalltown\n®\nmasonry and concrete tools; Husqvarna\n®\nand EGO\n®\noutdoor power equipment; John Deere\n®\nriding lawn mowers; Scotts\n®\nlawn care products, SharkBite\n®\nplumbing products; A. O. Smith\n®\nwater heaters; Norton\n®\nabrasives; Eaton\n®\nand Southwire\n®\nelectrical products and wire; and many more.\nPrivate Brands\nPrivate brands are an important element of our overall portfolio, helping to increase customer loyalty, drive sales, create differentiation, and improve margin.  We have a strong private brand presence across core categories, including some of our most valuable brands such as: Kobalt\n®\ntools; STAINMASTER\n®\ncarpets; allen+roth\n®\n, ORIGIN 21™, and Style Selections\n®\nhome décor products; Severe Weather\n®\npressure treated lumber; Project Source\n®\nhigh-value project completers; Holiday Living\n®\nseasonal products; Harbor Breeze\n®\nceiling fans; Sta-Green\n®\nlawn and garden products; Moxie\n®\ncleaning products; Reliabilt\n®\ndoors, windows, and hardware; and Utilitech\n®\nlighting and electrical products.\nSupply Chain\nWe source our products from vendors worldwide and believe that alternative and competitive suppliers are available for virtually all of our products.  Whenever possible, we purchase directly from manufacturers to provide savings for customers and improve our gross margin.\nTo efficiently move products from our vendors to our stores and maintain in-stock levels, we own and operate distribution facilities that enable products to be received from vendors, stored and picked, or cross-docked, and then shipped to our retail locations or directly to customers.  These facilities include 15 regional distribution centers (RDC) and 15 flatbed distribution centers (FDC) in the United States.  The FDCs distribute merchandise that requires special handling due to size or type of packaging such as lumber, boards, panel products, pipe, siding, ladders, and building materials.  On average, each RDC and FDC serves approximately 115 stores.  We also own and operate seven distribution centers, including four lumber yards, to serve our Canadian market.\nIn addition to the RDCs and FDCs, we also operate coastal holding and transload facilities (CHF) to handle import product, bulk distribution centers (BDC) to handle appliances and other big and bulky product, cross-dock delivery terminals (XDT) to fulfill final mile box truck deliveries, and fulfillment centers (FC) focused on parcel post eligible products.  As part of our market-based delivery model, we added three XDT ecosystems (consisting of six new XDTs) in fiscal 2021.  We also enhanced our distribution network by opening four BDCs, three FCs, and two CHFs.\nCollectively, our facilities enable our import and e-commerce products to get to their destination as efficiently as possible.  Most parcel-eligible items can be ordered by a customer and delivered within two business days at standard shipping rates.\nIn fiscal 2021, approximately 65% of the total dollar amount of merchandise we purchased flowed through our distribution network, while the remaining portion was shipped directly to our stores or customers directly from our vendors.\nOur Services\nInstalled Sales\nWe offer installation services through independent contractors in many of our product categories, with Flooring, Kitchens & Bath, Millwork, Appliances, and Lumber accounting for the majority of installed sales.  Our Installed Sales model, which separates selling and project administration tasks, allows our sales associates to focus on project selling, while project managers ensure that the details related to installing the products are efficiently executed.  Installed Sales, which includes both product and labor, accounted for approximately 5% of total sales in fiscal 2021.\nLowe’s Protection Plans and Repair Services\nWe offer extended protection plans for various products within the Appliances, Kitchens & Bath, Décor, Millwork, Rough Plumbing, Electrical, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, Tools, and Hardware categories.  These protection plans provide customers with product protection that enhances or extends coverage offered by the manufacturer’s warranty and provides additional customer-friendly benefits that go beyond the scope of a manufacturer’s warranty.  The protection plans provide in-warranty benefits and out-of-warranty repair services for major appliances, outdoor power equipment, tools, grills, fireplaces, air conditioners, water heaters, and other eligible products through our stores or in the home through the Lowe’s Authorized Service Repair Network.  Our contact centers take customers’ calls, assesses the problems, and facilitates resolutions, making after-sales service easier for our customers by managing the entire process.\nSelling Channels\nWe are continuing to enhance our omnichannel capabilities, which allows our customers to move from channel to channel with simple and seamless transitions even within the same transaction.  For example, for many projects, more than half of our customers conduct research online before making an in-store purchase.  For purchases made on Lowes.com, customers may pick up their purchase in-store at the customer service desk, curbside pick-up, or touchless lockers, or have their purchase delivered to their home or business.  In addition, flexible fulfillment options are available for in-store purchases and those made through the contact center.  Regardless of the channels through which customers choose to engage with us, we strive to provide them with a seamless experience across channels and an endless aisle of products, enabled by our flexible fulfillment capabilities.  Our ability to sell products in-store, online, on-site, or through our contact centers speaks to our leverage of our existing infrastructure with the omnichannel capabilities we continue to introduce.\nIn-Store\nOur 1,798 Lowe’s-branded home improvement stores, inclusive of 1,737 in the U.S. and 61 in Canada, are generally open seven days per week and average approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space, plus approximately 32,000 square feet of outdoor garden center selling space.  The 173 RONA stores operate under various complementary store formats that address target customers and occasions.  Our home improvement stores in the U.S. and Canada offer similar products and services, with certain variations based on localization.  We continue to develop and implement tools to make our sales associates more efficient and to integrate our order management and fulfillment processes.  Our home improvement stores have Wi-Fi capabilities that provide customers with Internet access, making information available quickly to further simplify the shopping experience.\nOnline\nThrough our websites and mobile applications, we seek to empower consumers by providing a 24/7 shopping experience, product information, customer ratings and reviews, buying guides, how-to videos and other information.  These tools help consumers make more informed purchasing decisions and give them increased confidence to undertake home improvement projects.  We enable customers to choose from a variety of fulfillment options, including buying online and picking up in-store, curbside pick-up, truck delivery and parcel shipment to their homes or businesses.  We also offer a new virtual kitchen design service and virtual sales support for sheds, fencing, generators, and other project-related categories to allow our customers to shop how, when, and where they want for services projects.\nOn-Site\nWe have on-site specialists available for retail and Pro customers to assist them in selecting products and services for their projects.  Our Pro sales managers meet with Pro customers at their place of business or on a job site and leverage nearby stores and our distribution network to ensure we meet customer needs for products and resources.  In addition, our In-Home Sales program is available in a majority of U.S. Lowe’s home improvement stores to discuss varying exterior projects such as windows/doors, roofing, siding, and deck projects, whose characteristics lend themselves to an in-home consultative sales approach.\nContact Centers\nLowe’s operates three contact centers which are located in Wilkesboro, North Carolina; Albuquerque, New Mexico; and Indianapolis, Indiana.  These contact centers help Lowe’s enable an omnichannel customer experience by providing the ability to tender sales, coordinate deliveries, manage after-sale installations, facilitate repair services for Appliances and Outdoor Power Equipment, and answer general customer questions via phone, mail, e-mail, live chat, and social media.\nHuman Capital\nWhen it comes to attracting and retaining top talent, Lowe’s strives to be an employer of choice.  We are committed to creating valuable career opportunities for our associates, supporting them and the communities where they live, and cultivating a culture that invites and encourages diverse opinions and ideas.  We enable associates to build meaningful careers that unlock their potential in an inclusive workplace as we work together to deliver the right home improvement products to our customers, with the best service and value, across every channel and community we serve.\nAs a testament to our commitments, in 2021 we received more than 15 notable employer of choice awards including being named: a Disability:IN National Best Place to Work for Disability Inclusion, a Forbes America’s Best Large Employers, a Best of the Best 2021 Top Employer by Black EOE Journal, HISPANIC Network Magazine, and Professional Woman’s Magazine, and a Best Corporation for Veteran’s Business Enterprises of the Year.\nOur People\nAs of January 28, 2022, Lowe’s employed approximately 200,000 full-time associates and 140,000 part-time associates, primarily in the United States, India, and Canada.  During the spring season, we temporarily expand our workforce by hiring associates in part-time, seasonal, and full-time positions to meet the elevated levels of demand.\nCertain employees in Canada are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  No other employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements.  Management considers its relations with employees to be good.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nWe believe that, by building diverse and inclusive teams, we drive better ideas, positive business results, and improve service through a deeper connection with our customers.  We continue to execute on our multi-year program to integrate diversity and inclusion initiatives into our corporate strategy across three areas: talent, culture, and business.  In our efforts to foster an inclusive culture, we launched a new multigenerational business resource group (BRG) in 2021, building upon the seven existing associate-led BRGs that are sponsored by our executive leadership team.  We have also introduced badges for our store uniforms that identify the store associates who speak Spanish or American Sign Language.  In 2021, we held our ninth annual Women’s Leadership Summit, focused on developing women leaders across our corporate and field locations.  Also, in 2020, Lowe’s joined the OneTen coalition, which as a whole, the coalition has committed to hiring one million Black Americans in the next ten years.\nTalent Development\nWe are committed to securing top talent and providing ongoing training and other developmental opportunities to facilitate meaningful careers at Lowe’s.  We enhanced our onboarding process so that new hires can quickly learn the skills needed for their position.  We offer a variety of leadership and development programs that develop skills and capabilities from product knowledge in our stores to advanced leadership principles for our leaders.\nThis year we expanded Lowe's University Academies offerings and included certification programs for store and technology associates that further develop their skills and knowledge base.\nAdditionally, through Lowe’s Track to the Trades program, we provide tuition reimbursement to our associates, encouraging them to complete apprentice certifications in carpentry, plumbing, electrical, heat, air ventilation and cooling (HVAC), or appliance repair.\nTotal Rewards and Wellness\nIn the spirit of building the best team and providing them with the best care, we are proud of the financial and well-being benefits we offer to our associates.  We have a strong track record of investing in our workforce by offering locally competitive salaries and wages.  We offer a wide variety of health, welfare, and financial benefits to our full-time and part-time associates, including health care and insurance benefits, retirement plans, an employee stock purchase plan, paid time off, leave programs and tuition assistance, among many others.\nIn response to the evolving coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, we continued to evolve our benefits and wellness programs to increase access to care.  We waived co-payments on pharmacy home deliveries, covered 100% of COVID-19 testing and vaccines, continued to operate our onsite clinics in a virtual care model, and launched a new virtual behavioral health app.  In partnership with CVS retail pharmacy and Premise onsite clinics, we launched a vaccine program, providing onsite access to\nsites across the country.  In 2021, we continued to offer emergency paid leave for associates who are suffering from COVID-19.\nStore and Workplace Safety\nOur associates and customers drive our success.  Providing them a safe environment for both working and shopping is essential.  We strive to maintain a culture of safety, which begins with our leaders modeling the behaviors we want our associates to adopt.  We embed safety into associate onboarding, developmental e-learning and on-the-job training.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we instituted rigorous safety standards in support of social distancing and enhanced sanitizing and cleaning.\nCorporate Responsibility Report\nAdditional information regarding our activities related to our people and human capital strategy, as well as our workforce diversity data, can be found in our Corporate Responsibility Report and Culture, Diversity & Inclusion Report, which are published annually.  The contents of these reports are not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or in any other report or document we file with the SEC.\nSeasonality and Working Capital\nThe retail business in general is subject to seasonal influences, and our business is, to some extent, seasonal.  Historically, we have realized the highest volume of sales during our second fiscal quarter (May, June, and July) and the lowest volume of sales during our fourth fiscal quarter (November, December, and January).  Accordingly, our working capital requirements have historically been greater during our fourth fiscal quarter as we build inventory in anticipation of the spring selling season and as we experience lower fourth fiscal quarter sales volumes.  We fund our working capital requirements primarily through cash flows generated from operations, but also with short-term borrowings, as needed.  For more detailed information, see the Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources section in\n, “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”, of this Annual Report.\nIntellectual Property\nThe name “Lowe’s” is a registered service mark of one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries.  We consider this mark and logo and the accompanying name recognition to be valuable to our business.  This subsidiary and other wholly-owned subsidiaries own and maintain various additional registered and unregistered trademarks, service marks and trade names, including retail names “RONA” and “Reno Depot”, and private brand product names “Kobalt”, “STAINMASTER” and “allen+roth”.  These subsidiaries also maintain various Internet domain names that are important to our business, and we also own registered and unregistered copyrights.  In addition, we maintain patent portfolios related to some of our products and services and seek to patent or otherwise protect certain innovations that we incorporate into our products, services, or business operations.\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to a wide array of federal, state, and local laws and regulations.  We do not currently expect compliance with these laws and regulations to have a material effect on our capital expenditures, results of operations, and competitive position as compared to prior periods.\nSustainability\nWe have a proud history of managing our business responsibly and serving our associates and communities.  We continue to integrate sustainability topics and issues into our business, including focusing on product sustainability, our associates and communities, and reducing the environmental footprint of our operations, which we believe will help drive long-term shareholder value.  In addition to oversight by the full Board of Directors, the Board has also delegated primary responsibility for more frequent and in-depth oversight of the Company’s sustainability strategies and initiatives and reviewing the Company’s position on significant environmental and social issues to the sustainability committee of the Board of Directors.  In fiscal 2021, for the third consecutive year, Lowe’s was included in the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index based on our environmental, social, and governance practices.\nReducing our Environmental Footprint\nWe are committed to mitigating climate change by reducing the environmental impact of our operations and supply chain through reducing carbon emissions with investments in energy efficiency, use of renewable energy, environmentally friendly transportation practices, and innovative water and waste management systems.\nGreenhouse Gas Emissions\nBy the end of 2022, we plan to announce a science based net-zero target.  The new target will include near and long-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction goals for our full value chain.  In addition to reducing GHG emissions from our operations, the new target will also include reduction efforts for our supply chain and the products we sell.  We are committed to reducing our operational environmental footprint and have made significant investments in our facilities.  Over the past three years, we have spent more than $550 million across multiple projects including indoor LED upgrades, replacing stores’ aging HVAC units with high efficiency models, installing and updating building management systems, and installing pallet grinders.\nWe are a member of the Renewable Energy Buyers Alliance to evaluate and explore new opportunities and technologies across renewable energy markets.  Our renewable energy generation expanded in 2020 when 100 megawatts of wind energy became operational in central Texas through a power purchase agreement, and we have established a pipeline of other offsite renewable projects becoming operational over several years.  In addition, we are in the process of evaluating on-site solar generation and battery storage options in multiple states.\nWe are dedicated to promoting sustainable practices in the transportation industry, and we collaborate with the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) SmartWay program to reduce transportation emissions by managing and reducing fuel usage by creating incentives for freight contractors to improve efficiency.  We are an EPA SmartWay program partner and aim for 100% SmartWay certification for our transportation providers; in the future this will be a program requirement for all transportation providers along with annual recertification.  This program provides access to comprehensive data and oversight of Scope 3 emissions associated with our U.S. transportation footprint.\nWaste\nWe partner with suppliers to improve recycling and waste diversion, develop regional management processes, measure waste streams and conduct waste audits.  At a local level, store waste, including cardboard, broken appliances, wood pallets, and more, are recycled through national and regional partners, and we provide in-store recycling and reuse centers for our customers to bring in plastic planter pots, compact fluorescent lamp bulbs, plastic bags, and rechargeable batteries.  In fiscal 2021, we joined the How2Recycle partnership in an effort to educate customers and increase the likelihood of proper recycling of our product packaging.  As technology and innovative practices improve, we will continue to explore opportunities to participate in the circular economy.\nWater\nWhile our water consumption is modest compared with other industries, we continue to focus on reducing water consumption within our operations.  We use smart irrigation controllers for efficient watering at the majority of stores in the United States and have been exploring other water-efficient technologies to increase water savings in our stores and garden centers.  Additionally, we utilize leak detection technology to catch leaks as they occur to prevent unnecessary water use.  We also have protocols in place to manage the disposal of chemicals to prevent release into waterways of the communities we serve.\nProduct Sustainability\nWe are committed to promoting sustainable practices throughout our supply chain and providing customers with high quality and safe products.  Our products undergo a thorough selection process, beginning with our sourcing decisions.  Through collaboration and established management systems, we monitor our suppliers’ practices to secure high-quality products from suppliers who support worker rights and protect the environment.  Lowe’s human rights policy, updated in fiscal 2021 to reflect our stance on modern slavery, supports the fundamental principles of Human Rights, as defined by the “Universal Declaration of Human Rights.”  We continue to hold all suppliers to our rigorous standards through our human rights policy, our conflict minerals policy, and our Vendor Code of Conduct which includes enhanced environmental standards for all suppliers.  In addition, we have a wood sourcing policy that specifies that all wood products sold in our stores originate from well-managed, non-endangered forests.\nAs part of our commitment to reducing the environmental impact of our products, we continue to increase our offering of independently certified products that have validated environmental claims, reduce the usage of natural resources, and save customers energy and water consumption.  We continue to work with local and regional utilities to offer customers assorted rebates for a variety of environmentally efficient products including ENERGY STAR® and WaterSense®.\nSustainability Reporting\nLowe’s participates in the CDP’s climate, forestry, and water security questionnaires to benchmark and quantify our environmental practices, to provide transparency on our progress, and assist in the reduction of our contributions to climate change.  In fiscal 2021, Lowe’s externally verified its Scope 1 and Scope 2 GHG emissions and water usage data to increase confidence in our reporting.  Additionally, we continued to align our sustainability reporting with the Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB), the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI), and the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).  Lowe’s published its first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report in fiscal 2021 to assess our climate-related risks and opportunities and better understand the potential impacts on our value chain.\nFor more information about Lowe’s sustainability efforts, please visit\nresponsibility.lowes.com\n.\nInvesting in Our Communities\nWe understand the important role Lowe’s plays in providing products, services, and support to communities in need.  As part of our goal to invest $350 million by 2025 in local communities, in 2021 we provided more than $100 million to these efforts, reinforcing our commitment to safe, affordable housing, investing in skilled trades education, and focusing on our unwavering support of rebuilding communities in the wake of natural disasters.\nLowe’s celebrated its centennial in 2021 by giving back through a new initiative, 100 Hometowns.  We launched the nationwide program to complete 100 impact projects to help communities rebuild from natural disasters, repair critical housing, restore community centers, revive green spaces, and more.  In total, more than 1.3 million people benefited from 100 Hometowns.\nDuring the year, Lowe’s led or partnered on initiatives to build, repair, modify, and renovate individual homes and housing facilities that benefit families, front-line workers, veterans, seniors and communities in need.  As an NFL partner, we worked with leading national nonprofit organization Rebuilding Together in thirteen NFL team markets to fund and complete critical housing repairs for single-family homes owned by front-line workers impacted by COVID-19.  In support of the military and veterans community, we partnered with Building Homes for Heroes to fund and help complete the construction or modification of eleven mortgage-free homes for U.S. veterans who were injured while serving in the military.\nAs areas of the U.S. recovered from various natural disasters throughout the year, Lowe’s helped meet essential needs in impacted communities and supported relief efforts with the American Red Cross and Good360, a nonprofit leader in product philanthropy.  Store associates supported customers by handing out free, critically-needed supplies, providing mobile laundry and shower trailers, volunteering to work at stores most impacted by the storms, and deploying the new Lowe’s Tool Rental Disaster Response Trailer to help people get safely back into their homes and get their local businesses up and running.\nLowe’s also continued efforts to help close the skilled trades gap in the U.S. with Generation T, a digital-first movement aimed at changing the way people see, learn and feel about the skilled trades.  Through various partnerships, we offered educational workshops, immersive experiences, and networking opportunities to students, transitioning military service members and their spouses.\nIn 2021, our associates across the U.S. and Canada contributed nearly 196,000 volunteer hours in the communities where they live and work.  A major contributor to this goal is the work done through Lowe’s Heroes, a company-wide effort where we provide funding for each U.S. and Canadian store to identify a project in their hometown that associates can support through volunteering.  The Lowe’s Employee Relief Fund, made possible through associate donations and company matching, supports associates in times of significant, unforeseen financial hardship.  In 2021, Lowe’s Employee Relief Fund distributed more than $4 million, helping 3,130 associates in need.\nFor more information on Lowe’s partnerships and latest community improvement projects, visit\nresponsibility.lowes.com\n.\nAvailable Information\nOur Annual Report, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, are made available free of charge through our Internet website at\nir.lowes.com\n, as soon as reasonably practicable after such documents are electronically filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).  The SEC maintains an Internet site,\nwww.sec.gov\n, that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC."

    "text": "We describe below certain risks that could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, business reputation or business prospects.  These risk factors may change from time to time and may be amended, supplemented or superseded by updates to the risk factors contained in our future periodic reports on Form 10-K, Form 10-Q and reports on other forms we file with the SEC.  All forward-looking statements about our future results of operations or other matters made by us in this Annual Report, in our Annual Report to Lowe’s Shareholders and in our subsequently filed reports to the SEC, as well as in our press releases and other public communications, are qualified by the risks described below.\nYou should read these risk factors in conjunction with “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in\nand our consolidated financial statements and related notes in\n.  There also may be other factors that we cannot anticipate or that are not described in this Annual Report generally because we do not currently perceive\nthem to be material.  Those factors could cause results to differ materially from our expectations.  In connection with any investment decision with respect to our securities, you should carefully consider the following risk factors, as well as the other information contained in this report and our other filings with the SEC.\nStrategic, Competitive, Operational, and Reputational Risks\nWe may be unable to adapt our business concept in a rapidly evolving retail environment to address the changing shopping habits, demands, and demographics of our customers, or realize the intended benefits of strategic initiatives.\nThe home improvement retail environment, like the retail environment generally, is rapidly evolving, and adapting our business concept to respond to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and their changing demographics is critical to our future success.  Our success is dependent on our ability to identify and respond to the economic, social, style, and other trends that affect demographic and consumer preferences in a variety of our merchandise categories and service offerings.  Customers’ expectations about how they wish to research, purchase, and receive products and services have also evolved.  It is difficult to predict the mix of products and services that our customers will demand.  As customers begin to expect a more personalized experience, our ability to offer more localized assortments of our merchandise to appeal to local cultural and demographic tastes within each customer group is important to our ability to effectively meet customer expectations.  If we do not successfully differentiate the shopping experience to meet the individual needs and expectations of or within a customer group, we may lose market share with respect to those customers.\nFurther, we have a store base that requires maintenance, investment, and space reallocation initiatives to deliver the shopping experience that our customers desire.  Our capital investments in our stores may not deliver the relevant shopping experience our customers expect.  We must also maintain a safe store environment for our customers and associates, as well as to protect against loss or theft of our inventory (known as “shrink”).  Higher rates of shrink, which we have experienced from time to time, can require operational changes that may increase costs.\nFailure to identify such trends, adapt our business concept, implement an increasingly localized merchandising assortment, improve and maintain safe stores, and implement change, growth, productivity and other strategic initiatives successfully could negatively affect our relationship with our customers, the demand for the home improvement products and services we sell, the rate of growth of our business, our market share, and results of operations.\nWe may not be able to realize the benefits of our strategic initiatives focused on omnichannel sales and marketing presence if we fail to deliver the capabilities required to execute on them.\nOur interactions with customers have evolved into an omnichannel experience as they increasingly are using computers, tablets, mobile phones, and other electronic devices to shop in our stores and online and provide feedback and public commentary about all aspects of our business.  Omnichannel retail is quickly evolving, and we must anticipate and meet our customers’ expectations and counteract new developments and technology investments by our competitors.  Our customer-facing technology systems must appeal to our customers, function as designed and provide a consistent customer experience.  We also need to collect, use and share relevant customer data to effectively meet customer expectations of a more personalized experience.  Our ability to collect, use, and share such data is subject to a number of external factors, including the impact of legislation or regulations governing data privacy and security, as well as the change of third party policies restricting data collection, use, and sharing.\nThe success of our strategic initiatives to adapt our business concept to our customers’ changing shopping habits and demands and changing demographics have required us to and will continue to require us to deliver large, complex programs requiring integrated planning, initiative prioritization, and program sequencing.  These initiatives have required and will continue to require new competencies in many positions, and our management, employees and contractors have had to and will need to continue to adapt and learn new skills and capabilities.  To the extent they are unable or unwilling to make these transformational changes, we may be unable to realize the full benefits of our strategic initiatives and expand our relevant market access.  Failure to realize the benefits of amounts we invest in new technologies, products, or services could result in the value of those investments being written down or written off.  In addition, to support our strategic initiatives and the related technology investments needed to implement our strategic investments, we must attract and retain a large number of skilled professionals, including technology professionals.  The market for these professionals is increasingly competitive.  Our results of operations, financial condition, or business prospects could also be adversely affected if we fail to provide a consistent experience for our customers, regardless of sales channel, if our technology systems do not meet our customers’ expectations, if we are unable to counteract new developments and innovations implemented by our competitors or if we are unable to attract, retain and manage the talent succession of additional personnel at various levels of the Company who have the skills and capabilities we need to implement our strategic initiatives and drive the changes that are essential to successfully adapting our business concept in the rapidly changing retail environment.\nWe have many competitors who could take sales and market share from us if we fail to execute our merchandising, marketing and distribution strategies effectively, or if they develop a substantially more effective or lower cost means of meeting customer needs, resulting in a negative impact on our business and results of operations.\nWe operate in a highly competitive market for home improvement products and services and have numerous large and small, direct and indirect competitors.  The principal competitive factors in our industry include convenience, customer service and experience, quality and price of merchandise and services, in-stock levels, and merchandise assortment and presentation.  We face growing competition from online and omnichannel retailers who have a similar product or service offering.  Customers are increasingly able to quickly comparison shop and determine real-time product availability and price using digital tools.  Further, online and omnichannel retailers continue to focus on delivery services, as customers are increasingly seeking faster, guaranteed delivery times, including same-day and next-day fulfillment, low-price or free shipping, and convenient pick-up options, including curbside pick-up, in-store pick-up, and buy online pick-up in-store (BOPIS) lockers, and we must make investments to keep up with our customers’ evolving shopping preferences.  Our ability to be competitive on delivery times, delivery costs, and delivery options depends on many factors, including successful implementation and the continued maintenance of our initiatives related to supply chain transformation, including our market-based delivery model.  Our failure to respond effectively to competitive pressures and changes in the markets for home improvement products and services could affect our financial performance.  Moreover, changes in the promotional pricing and other practices of our competitors, including the effects of competitor liquidation activities, may impact our results.\nIf we fail to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates with expanded skill sets or corporate support staff with the capabilities of delivering on strategic objectives, we could lose sales to our competitors, and our labor costs, resulting from operations or the execution of corporate strategies, could be negatively affected.\nOur customers, whether they are homeowners, renters or commercial businesses, expect our associates to be well trained and knowledgeable about the products we sell and the home improvement services we provide.  We compete with other retailers for many of our associates, and we are experiencing an unusually competitive labor market.  Wages are increasing across the United States, and competitors are offering higher compensation than before, due to labor market conditions. Many associates are in entry-level or part-time roles with historically high turnover rates, which has led to increased training and retention costs, particularly in a competitive labor market.  Increasingly, our sales associates must have expanded skill sets, including, in some instances, the ability to do in-home or telephone sales.  We need to attract and retain a diverse workforce that can deliver relevant, culturally competent and differentiated experiences for a wide variety of culturally diverse customers.  Additionally, in order to deliver on the omnichannel expectations of our customers, we rely on the specialized training and capabilities of corporate support staff, which are broadly sought after by our competitors.  Further, our ability to successfully execute organizational changes, including management transitions within the Company's senior leadership are critical to our business success.  If we are unable to hire, train, manage, and retain qualified associates and specialists, the quality of service we provide to our customers may decrease and our results of operations could be negatively affected.\nFurthermore, our ability to meet our labor needs, particularly in a competitive labor market, while controlling our costs is subject to a variety of external factors, including prevailing wage rates, the availability of and competition for talent, health care and other benefit costs, our brand image and reputation, changing demographics and the adoption of new or revised legislation or regulations governing immigration, employment, labor relations, minimum wage, and health care benefits.  Periodically, we are subject to labor organizing efforts, and if we become subject to collective bargaining agreements in the future, it could affect how we operate our business and adversely affect our labor costs.  In addition to our United States and Canada operations, we have support offices in India and China, and any extended disruption of our operations in our different locations, whether due to labor difficulties or otherwise, could adversely affect our business and results of operations.\nPositively and effectively managing our public image and reputation is critical to our business success, and, if our public image and reputation are damaged, it could negatively impact our relationships with our customers, vendors, and associates and, consequently, our business and results of operations.\nOur public image and reputation are critical to ensuring that our customers shop at Lowe’s, our vendors want to do business with Lowe’s, and our associates want to work for Lowe’s.  We must continue to manage, preserve and grow Lowe’s public image and reputation. Lowe’s actual or perceived position or lack of position on social, environmental, political, public policy, or other sensitive issues, and any perceived lack of transparency about those matters, could harm our reputation.  In addition, failure to meet our stated environmental and social goals, and consumer and investor concerns about our environmental and social practices are potential sources of reputational risk.  In addition, vendors and others with whom we do business may affect our reputation. Any negative incident can erode trust and confidence quickly, and adverse publicity about us could damage our reputation and brand image, undermine our customers’ confidence, reduce demand for our products and services, affect our relationships with current and future vendors, impact our results of operations, affect our ability to recruit, retain, and engage our associates, and attract regulatory scrutiny.  The significant expansion in the use of social media over recent years has compounded the potential scope of the negative publicity that could be generated by such negative incidents.\nAdditionally, our proprietary rights in our trademarks, trade names, service marks, domain names, copyrights, patents, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights are valuable assets of our business.  We may not be able to prevent or even discover every instance of unauthorized third party uses of our intellectual property or dilution of our brand names, such as when a third party uses trademarks that are identical or similar to our own.  If we are unable to successfully protect our intellectual property rights, our business could be adversely affected.\nFailure to achieve and maintain a high level of product and service quality could damage our image with customers, expose us to litigation and negatively impact our sales, profitability, cash flows, and financial condition.\nProduct and service quality issues could result in a negative impact on customer confidence in Lowe’s and our brand image.  If our product and service offerings do not meet applicable safety standards or our customers’ expectations regarding safety or quality, we could experience lost sales and increased costs and be exposed to legal, financial and reputational risks.  Actual, potential or perceived product safety concerns could expose us to litigation, as well as government enforcement action, and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities.  As a result, Lowe’s reputation as a retailer of high-quality products and services, including both national and Lowe’s private brands, could suffer and impact customer loyalty.  Additionally, we and our customers have expectations on responsible sourcing.  Under our Vendor Code of Conduct, our vendors are required to meet our expectations across multiple areas of compliance, including health and safety, environmental standards, compensation, hours of work, and prohibitions on child and forced labor.  If we need to seek alternative sources of supply from vendors with whom we have less familiarity, the risk of our standards not being met may increase.\nSupply Chain and Third-Party Risks\nDisruptions in our international supply chain and our fulfillment network for our products due to factors, including the COVID-19 pandemic, trade policy changes, and additional tariffs, have and continue to affect our results of operations.\nCircumstances surrounding and related to the COVID-19 pandemic have created unprecedented impacts on the global supply chain.  We source, stock and sell products from domestic and international vendors, and their ability to reliably and efficiently fulfill our orders is critical to our business success.  Impacts related to the COVID-19 pandemic are placing strains on the domestic and international supply chain that have negatively affected the flow and availability of our products.  This can and has resulted in higher out-of-stock inventory positions due to difficulties in timely obtaining products from the manufacturers and suppliers of our products.  In addition, the costs of transportation of those products to our distribution centers and stores have increased while availability of transportation has decreased, which could negatively affect our business and financial results.  Even if we are able to find alternate sources for such products, they may cost more, which could adversely impact our profitability and financial condition.\nWe source a large number of our products from foreign manufacturers, with China being the dominant import source.  Tax and trade policies, tariffs, and other regulations affecting trade between the U.S. and other countries, especially China, enacted in recent years increased the cost of our merchandise sourced from outside of the U.S., which represents a large percentage of our overall merchandise.  It remains unclear how tax or trade policies, tariffs, or trade relations may evolve in the future, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, effective income tax rate, liquidity, and net income.  In addition, other countries may change their business and trade policies in anticipation of or in response to increased import tariffs and other changes in U.S. trade policy and regulations already enacted or that may be enacted in the future.  The degree of our exposure is dependent on, among other things, the type of goods, rates imposed, and timing of tariffs.  The impact to our business, including net sales and gross margin, will be influenced in part by merchandising and pricing strategies in response to potential cost increases by us and our competitors.  While these potential impacts are uncertain, they could have an adverse impact on our financial results.\nFinancial instability among key vendors, political instability and labor unrest in source countries or elsewhere in our supply chain, changes in the total costs in our supply chain (including fuel and currency exchange rates), labor costs or labor shortages among our vendors, port labor disputes and security, the outbreak of pandemics, weather-related events, natural disasters, armed conflicts, work stoppages, shipping capacity restraints, changes in trade policy, retaliatory trade restrictions imposed by either the United States or a major source country, tariffs or duties, fluctuations in currency exchange rates and transport availability, capacity, and costs are beyond our control and could negatively impact our business if they seriously disrupted the movement of products through our supply chain or increased their costs.  In recent years, U.S. ports have been impacted by capacity constraints, port congestion and delays, periodic labor disputes, security issues, weather-related events, and natural disasters, which have been further exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Additionally, as we add fulfillment capabilities or pursue strategies with different fulfillment requirements, our fulfillment network becomes increasingly complex and operating it becomes more challenging.  If our fulfillment network does not operate properly or if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments, we experience delays in inventory, increased delivery costs or merchandise out-of-stocks that could lead to lost sales and decreased customer confidence, and adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with selected suppliers of brand name products could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\nWe form strategic relationships with selected suppliers to market and develop products under a variety of recognized and respected national and international brand names.  We also have relationships with certain suppliers to enable us to sell proprietary products which differentiate us from other retailers.  The inability to effectively and efficiently manage and maintain our relationships with these suppliers could negatively impact our business operations and financial results.\nFailure of a key vendor or service provider that we cannot quickly replace could disrupt our operations and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe rely upon a number of vendors as the sole or primary source of some of the products we sell.  We also rely upon many independent service providers for technology solutions and other services that are important to many aspects of our business.  Many of these vendors and service providers have certain products or specialized skills needed to support our business concept and our strategies.  If these vendors or service providers discontinue operations or are unable to perform as expected or if we fail to manage them properly or we are unable to replace them quickly, our business could be adversely affected, at least temporarily, until we are able to replace them.\nFailures relating to our third-party installer program or by our third-party installers could result in increased operational and legal risks and negatively impact our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe contract with third-party installers to provide installation services to our customers, and, as the general contractor, we are subject to regulatory requirements and risks applicable to general contractors, including certain licensing and permitting requirements, and those relating to the quality and performance of our third-party installers.  Our or our third-party installers’ failures to effectively manage such requirements and internal processes regarding installation services could result in lost sales, fines and lawsuits, as well as damage to our reputation, and may result in the loss of our general contractor licenses, which could negatively affect our business.\nTechnology and Cybersecurity Risks\nOur financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems or the information systems of third-party vendors are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\nOur efforts to provide an omnichannel experience for our customers include investing in, maintaining and making ongoing improvements of our existing information systems that support operations, such as sales, inventory replenishment, merchandise ordering, project design and execution, transportation, receipt processing and fulfillment.  We also engage third-party vendors for a variety of reasons, including for digital storage technology and content delivery.  Such vendors may have access to information about our customers, associates, or vendors.  Our systems and the systems of third-party vendors are subject to damage or interruption as a result of catastrophic events, power outages, viruses, malicious attacks and telecommunications failures, or other vulnerabilities and irregularities, and as a result we may incur significant expense, data loss, as well as, an erosion of customer confidence.  Additionally, we continually make investments in our systems which may introduce disruption.  Our financial performance could be adversely affected if our information systems are seriously disrupted or we fail to properly maintain, improve, upgrade and expand those systems.\nAs customer-facing technology systems become an increasingly important part of our omnichannel sales and marketing strategy, the failure of those systems to perform effectively and reliably could keep us from delivering positive customer experiences.\nAccess to the Internet from computers, tablets, smart phones and other mobile communication devices has empowered our customers and changed the way they shop and how we interact with them.  Our websites, including Lowes.com, are a sales channel for our products, and are also a method of making product, project and other relevant information available to our customers that impacts our in-store sales.  Additionally, we have multiple affiliated websites and mobile apps through which we seek to inspire, inform, cross-sell, establish online communities among, and otherwise interact with our customers, including through online visualization and configuration tools.  Performance issues with these customer-facing technology systems, including temporary outages caused by distributed denial of service, ransomware, or other cyber-attacks, or a complete failure of one or more of them without a disaster recovery plan that can be quickly implemented, could quickly destroy the positive benefits they provide to our home improvement business and negatively affect our customers’ perceptions of Lowe’s as a reliable online vendor and source of information about home improvement products and services.\nOur business and our reputation could be adversely affected by cybersecurity incidents and the failure to protect customer, employee, vendor, or Company information or to comply with evolving regulations relating to our obligation to protect our systems, assets and such information.\nCyber attacks and tactics designed to gain access to and exploit sensitive information by breaching mission critical systems of large organizations are constantly evolving, and high profile security breaches leading to unauthorized release of sensitive customer information have occurred in recent years with increasing frequency at a number of major U.S. companies, including several large retailers, despite widespread recognition of the cyber-attack threat and improved data protection methods.  As with many other retailers, we collect, process, transmit, store, and delete certain personal information about our customers, employees and vendors, as well as confidential, sensitive, proprietary and business, personal and payment card information.  Additionally, we use third-party service providers for certain services, such as authentication, content delivery, back-office support, fraud prevention, order and service fulfillment, supply chain management, customer service, workforce management, and other functions, and we provide such third-party service providers with personal and other confidential information necessary for the services concerned.  We are subject to the risk that unauthorized parties will attempt to gain access to our systems or our information through fraud or other means of deceiving our associates, third party providers, or vendors.  Certain of our third-party vendors have been subject to disruptions due to ransomware and other cyber attacks.  We and our third-party service providers may not be able to adequately anticipate or prevent a future breach in our or their systems that results in the unauthorized access to, destruction, misuse, or release of personal information or other sensitive data.  It can be difficult to preempt or detect ever-evolving forms of cyber-attacks.  A ransomware attack could prevent us or our third-party service providers from accessing data or systems that support Lowe’s operations.  Our information security or our service providers’ information security may also be compromised because of human errors, including by employees, or system errors.  Our systems and our service providers’ systems are additionally vulnerable to a number of other causes, such as critical infrastructure outages, computer viruses, technology system failures, catastrophic events or cyber-attacks, including the use of malicious codes, worms, phishing, and ransomware.  In the event that our systems are breached or damaged for any reason, we may also suffer loss or unavailability of data and interruptions to our business operations while such breach or damage is being remedied.  Should these events occur, the unauthorized disclosure, loss or unavailability of data and disruption to our business may have a material adverse effect on our reputation, drive existing and potential customers away and lead to financial losses from remedial actions, or potential liability, including possible litigation and punitive damages.  A security breach resulting in the unauthorized release of data from our information systems or our third-party service providers’ information systems could also materially increase the costs we already incur to protect against such risks and require dedication of substantial resources to manage the aftermath of such a breach.\nData privacy and cybersecurity laws in the United States and internationally are constantly changing, and the implementation of these laws has become more complex.  In the United States alone, we may be subject to regulation at both the federal and state level.  For example, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 and its subsequent amendment grants California consumers certain rights over their personal information and imposes stringent requirements on the collection, use and sharing of “personal information” of California consumers.  Other U.S. states are proposing or have adopted similar laws related to the protection of personal information, including the Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act and the Colorado Privacy Act, both of which will go into effect in 2023, and the U.S. federal government is also considering federal privacy legislation.  In order to maintain our compliance with such laws as they come to fruition, we may sustain increased costs in order to continually evaluate our policies and processes and adapt to new requirements that are or become applicable to us.  As the regulatory environment relating to retailers’ and other companies’ obligation to protect personal information becomes stricter, a material failure on our part to comply with applicable regulations could subject us to fines, other regulatory sanctions or government investigation, and potentially to lawsuits brought by private individuals, regulators or states’ attorney general.  Such violation or perceived violation of privacy, including improper collection, use of sharing of personal information, or failure to sufficiently disclose privacy practice, can adversely affect the trust that customers, employees, and business partners have in us related to their personal information.\nWe are subject to payments-related risks that could increase our operating costs, expose us to fraud, subject us to potential liability and potentially disrupt our business.\nWe accept payments using a variety of methods, including credit cards, debit cards, credit accounts, our private label and co-branded credit cards, PayPal, trade credit, gift cards, cash, consumer invoicing and physical bank checks, and we may offer different payment options over time.  These payment options subject us to many compliance requirements, including, but not limited to, compliance with payment card association operating rules, including data security rules, certification requirements, rules governing electronic funds transfers and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standards.  They also subject us to potential fraud by criminal elements seeking to discover and take advantage of security vulnerabilities that may exist in some of these payment systems.  For certain payment methods, including credit and debit cards, we pay interchange and other fees, which may increase over time and raise our operating costs.  We rely on third parties to provide payment processing services, including the processing of credit cards, debit cards, electronic checks, gift cards and promotional financing, and it could disrupt our business if these companies become unwilling or unable to provide these services to us.  If we fail to comply with these rules or requirements, or if our data security systems are breached or compromised, we may be liable for card issuing banks’ costs, subject to fines and higher transaction fees, and lose our ability to accept credit and debit card payments from our\ncustomers, process electronic funds transfers, or facilitate other types of online payments, and our business and operating results could be adversely affected.\nInvestment-Related Risks\nOur strategic transactions involve risks, and we may not realize the expected benefits because of numerous uncertainties and risks.\nWe regularly consider and enter into strategic transactions, including mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and other growth, market and geographic expansion strategies, with the expectation that these transactions will result in increases in sales, cost savings, synergies and other various benefits.  Our ability to deliver the expected benefits from any strategic transaction is subject to numerous uncertainties and risks, including our ability to integrate personnel, labor models, financial, IT and other systems successfully; disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management; hiring additional management and other critical personnel; and increasing the scope, geographic diversity and complexity of our operations.  Effective internal controls are necessary to provide reliable and accurate financial reports, and the integration of businesses may create complexity in our financial systems and internal controls and make them more difficult to manage.  Integration of businesses into our internal control system could cause us to fail to meet our financial reporting obligations.  Additionally, any impairment of goodwill or other assets acquired or divested in a strategic transaction or charges to earnings associated with any strategic transaction, may materially reduce our earnings.  Our shareholders may react unfavorably to our strategic transactions.  We may not realize any anticipated benefits from such transactions, we may be exposed to additional liabilities of any acquired business or joint venture, and we may be exposed to litigation in connection with the strategic transaction.  Further, we may finance these strategic transactions by incurring additional debt, which could increase leverage or impact our ability to access capital in the future.\nOperating internationally presents unique challenges, including some that have required us to adapt our store operations, merchandising, marketing, and distribution functions to serve customers in Canada.\nOur business and results of operations could be negatively affected if we are unable to effectively address these challenges.\nWe operate stores in Canada.  Expanding and operating internationally presents unique challenges that may increase the anticipated costs and risks of operation and expansion and slow the anticipated rate of expansion.  Our future operating results in Canada or in other countries or regions in which we may operate in the future could be negatively affected by a variety of factors, including unfavorable political or economic factors, adverse tax consequences, volatility in foreign currency exchange rates, increased difficulty in enforcing intellectual property rights, costs and difficulties of managing international operations, challenges with identifying and contracting with local suppliers and other risks created as a result of differences in culture, laws and regulations.  These factors could restrict our ability to operate our international businesses profitably and therefore have a negative impact on our results of operations and financial position.  In addition, our reported results of operations and financial position could also be negatively affected by exchange rates when the activities and balances of our foreign operations are translated into U.S. dollars for financial reporting purposes.\nLegal, Regulatory and Other External Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has affected and is expected to continue to affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic had a significant effect on us in 2020 and 2021, affecting our business operations, demand for our products and services, our costs of doing business, availability of labor, access to inventory, supply chain operations, our ability to predict future performance, exposure to litigation, and our financial condition, among other things.  There is considerable uncertainty regarding the continuing effects of the pandemic, including the possible recurrence of measures to try to contain the virus, such as travel restrictions, quarantines, “shelter-in-place” orders, and various other restrictive measures.\nIn addition, we have seen an increase in spending on home improvement products and projects during the pandemic, as customers have focused on their homes and have spent less on other items like travel and entertainment.  As the pandemic begins to subside, customers may shift their spending away from home improvement and back to other areas, which may have an adverse impact on our sales.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic further impacts our business, results of operations and financial condition will depend on numerous evolving factors which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including among others:\n•\nthe duration and scope of the pandemic and associated disruptions, including whether there are additional “waves” or other continued periods of increases or spikes in the number of COVID-19 cases, future variants or related strains of the virus in areas where we or our suppliers operate;\n•\nthe effects of current and future governmental and public responses to changing conditions;\n•\nthe availability of, and prevalence of access to, effective medical treatments and vaccines for COVID-19; and\n•\nevolving macroeconomic factors, including general economic uncertainty, unemployment rates and recessionary pressures.\nAny of the foregoing factors, or other effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or another pandemic, may result in adverse impacts to our business, results of operations, and financial condition.  The impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed herein.\nOur sales are dependent upon the health and stability of the general economy.\nAdverse changes in economic factors specific to the home improvement industry may negatively impact the rate of growth of our total sales and comparable sales.\nMany U.S. and global economic factors may adversely affect our financial performance.  These include, but are not limited to, periods of slow economic growth or recession, home price appreciation or decreasing housing turnover, volatility and/or lack of liquidity from time to time in U.S. and world financial markets and the consequent reduced availability and/or higher cost of borrowing to Lowe’s and its customers, slower rates of growth in real disposable personal income that could affect the rate of growth in consumer spending, inflation and its impacts on discretionary spending and on our costs, shortages, and other disruptions in the labor supply, consumer debt levels, changes in tax rates and policy, outbreak of pandemics, fluctuations in fuel and energy costs, inflation or deflation of commodity prices, natural disasters, armed conflicts, and acts of both domestic and international terrorism.  Sales of many of our product categories and services are driven by the activity level of home improvement projects.  Adverse development in these factors could result in a decrease in home improvement activity which could reduce demand for our products and services.\nOur business could be affected by uncharacteristic or significant weather conditions, including natural disasters and changes in climate, as well as other catastrophic events, which could impact our operations.\nNatural disasters, such as hurricanes and tropical storms, fires, floods, tornadoes, and earthquakes; unseasonable, or unexpected or extreme weather conditions, such as major or extended winter storms or droughts, whether as a result of climate change or otherwise; severe changes in climate; pandemics and public health concerns; acts of terrorism or violence, including active shooter situations; civil unrest; or similar disruptions and catastrophic events can affect consumer spending and confidence and consumers’ disposable income, particularly with respect to home improvement or construction projects, and could have an adverse effect on our financial performance.  These types of events can also adversely affect our work force and prevent associates and customers from reaching our stores and other facilities.  They can also disrupt or disable operations of stores, support centers, and portions of our supply chain and distribution network, including causing reductions in the availability of inventory and disruption of utility services.  In addition, these events may affect our information systems, resulting in disruption to various aspects of our operations, including our ability to transact with customers and fulfill orders and to communicate with our stores.  Unseasonable, unexpected or extreme weather conditions such as excessive precipitation, warm temperatures during the winter season, or prolonged or extreme periods of warm or cold temperatures, could render a portion of our inventory damaged or unsellable.  As a consequence of these or other catastrophic or uncharacteristic events, we may experience interruption to our operations, increased costs, or losses of property, equipment or inventory, which would adversely affect our revenue and profitability.\nOur business and operations are subject to risks related to the long-term effects of global climate change.\nOur business and operations are subject to inherent climate-related risks.  These include both physical risks (such as extreme weather conditions or rising sea levels) and transition risks (such as regulatory or technology changes), which are expected to be widespread and unpredictable.  Climate change, extreme weather conditions, wildfires, droughts, and rising sea levels may impact the areas in which the Company’s operations and facilities are located, and they could also affect our ability to procure commodities at costs and in quantities we currently experience.  Such events could result in an increase in our costs and expenses and harm our future revenue, cash flows and financial performance.  Government regulations limiting carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions may increase compliance and merchandise costs, and other regulations affecting energy inputs could materially affect our profitability.  In addition, we also use natural gas, diesel fuel, gasoline and electricity in our operations, all of which could face increased regulation as a result of climate change or other environmental concerns.\nOur costs of doing business could increase as a result of changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations.\nOur business is subject to a wide array of federal, state and local laws and regulations.  In recent years, a number of new laws and regulations have been adopted, and there has been expanded enforcement of certain existing laws and regulations by federal, state and local agencies.  These laws and regulations, and related interpretations and enforcement activity, may change\nas a result of a variety of factors, including political, economic or social events. Changes in, expanded enforcement of, or adoption of new federal, state or local laws and regulations governing minimum wage or living wage requirements, collective bargaining units, the classification of exempt and non-exempt employees, the distinction between employees and contractors, other wage, labor or workplace regulations, health care, data privacy and cybersecurity, the sale and pricing of some of our products, transportation, logistics, international trade, responsible sourcing, supply chain transparency, taxes, unclaimed property, sustainability, the environment and climate change, including energy costs and consumption, could increase our costs of doing business or impact our operations.  In addition, if we fail to comply with other applicable laws and regulations, including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and local anti-bribery laws, we could be subject to reputation and legal risk, including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nFuture litigation or governmental proceedings could result in material adverse consequences, including judgments or settlements, negatively affecting our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are, and in the future will become, involved in lawsuits, including consumer, commercial, employment, tort and other litigation, regulatory inquiries, and governmental and other legal proceedings arising out of the ordinary course of our business.  Some of these proceedings may raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and can be subject to uncertainties and complexities.  The timing of the final resolutions to lawsuits, regulatory inquiries and governmental and other legal proceedings is typically uncertain.  Additionally, the possible outcomes of, or resolutions to, these proceedings could include adverse judgments or settlements, either of which could require substantial payments.  Furthermore, defending against these proceedings may require a diversion of management’s attention and resources.  None of the legal proceedings in which we are currently involved, individually or collectively, are considered material.\nThe inflation or deflation of commodity prices could affect our prices, demand for our products and our sales.\nPrices of certain commodity products, including lumber, copper, and other raw materials, are historically volatile and are subject to fluctuations arising from changes in domestic and international supply and demand, labor costs, competition, market speculation, government regulations, tariffs and trade restrictions, and periodic delays in delivery.  Rapid and significant changes in commodity prices, such as changes in lumber prices, affect the demand for our products and our sales.\nTax\nmatters could adversely affect our results of operations and financial conditions.\nWe may be affected by higher rates of federal, state, or local tax imposed as a result of political developments or economic conditions, which could affect our effective tax rate.  Our effective tax rate and future tax liability could be adversely affected by regulatory and legal changes, the results of tax audits and examinations, and changes in accounting principles and interpretations relating to tax matters, all of which could negatively impact our business.  In addition, changes in tax laws and regulations that impact our customers and counterparties or the economy generally may also impact our financial condition and results of operations.\nLiquidity and access to capital rely on efficient, rational and open capital markets and are dependent on Lowe’s credit strength.  Our inability to access capital markets could negatively affect our business, financial performance and results of operations.\nWe have relied on the public debt markets to fund portions of our capital investments and the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund our working capital needs.  Our access to these markets depends on our strong credit ratings, the overall condition of debt capital markets and our operating performance.  Disruption in the financial markets or an erosion of our credit strength or declines on our credit rating could impact negatively our ability to meet capital requirements or fund working capital needs."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis summarizes the significant factors affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition, liquidity and capital resources during the two-year period ended January 28, 2022 (our fiscal years 2021 and 2020).  Unless otherwise noted, all references herein for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 represent the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.  We intend for this discussion to provide the reader with information that will assist in understanding our financial statements, the changes in certain key items in those financial statements from year to year, and the primary factors that accounted for those changes, as well as how certain accounting principles affect our financial statements.  This discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.  This discussion and analysis is presented in four sections:\n•\n•\n•\n•\nEXECUTIVE OVERVIEW\nPerformance Overview\nNet sales for fiscal 2021 increased 7.4% over fiscal year 2020 to $96.3 billion.  The increase in total sales was primarily driven by comparable sales growth.  Comparable sales increased 6.9% over fiscal year 2020, driven by an 11.1% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 4.2% decrease in comparable customer transactions.  Net earnings for fiscal 2021 increased 44.7% to $8.4 billion.  Diluted earnings per common share increased 55.3% in fiscal year 2021 to $12.04 from $7.75 in 2020.  Included in the fiscal 2020 results are a $1.1 billion pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt from cash tender offers to purchase and retire an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion in outstanding notes, as well as operating costs related to the Canada restructuring actions.  Adjusting for these items, diluted earnings per common share increased 35.9% to $12.04 in 2021 from adjusted diluted earnings per common share of $8.86 in 2020 (see the\ndiscussion).\nFor 2021, cash flows from operating activities were $10.1 billion, with $1.9 billion used for capital expenditures.  Continuing to deliver on our commitment to return excess cash to shareholders, the Company repurchased $13.1 billion of common stock and paid $2.0 billion in dividends during the year.\nIn 2021, we experienced comparable sales increases in eleven of fifteen product categories and all fifteen U.S. regions.  Our Total Home strategy continues to gain momentum as we provide a one-stop solution for both DIY and Pro customers.  Throughout fiscal 2021, we maintained focus on the Pro customer with improved in-stock inventory levels and store layout, enhanced service offerings, and expanded brand and product offerings that meet their project needs.  We enhanced the customer online shopping experience with improved search and navigation functionality and expanded on-trend inventory assortments.  Our private brand product assortment has also elevated our performance with the DIY customer, especially in Home Décor.  In addition, we have expanded our omnichannel fulfillment capabilities.  During 2021, we converted three geographic areas to our market-based delivery model for big and bulky product.  In this new model, product flows directly to customer homes from our distribution network, bypassing stores altogether.  As part of our fulfillment capabilities, our customers can also now track appliance deliveries in real time and we continue to expand our same-day and next-day fulfillment options.\nIn the stores, our disciplined focus on driving operating leverage through our Perpetual Productivity Improvement (PPI) initiatives resulted in operational process improvements that reduced the amount of time our associates spend on tasking activities and can instead focus on serving our customers.  As part of these initiatives, we recently launched a new store inventory management system that provides associates real-time visibility to inventory in their store and reduces non-productive hours spent looking for product.  In addition, we expanded our simplified user interface introduced earlier in the year across the sales floor which accelerates the associate training process and allows associates to focus on customer service while reducing customer wait times.\nLooking Forward\nAs part of our continued efforts around our Total Home strategy, we are focused on further enhancing our omnichannel capabilities in 2022 across three key areas: expanding our online assortment, enhancing the user experience, and improving\nfulfillment.  We will continue to expand our Lowes.com assortment to meet our customers’ design and lifestyle needs, while at the same time, enhancing the user experience with upgrades to the visualization and configuration tools we offer online.   As we head into spring, we have leveraged our expanded supply chain network to position our in-stock inventory for our heavy selling season.\nWhile there is uncertainty in the economy with rising interest rates and inflation, our outlook for the home improvement industry remains robust, and we believe we are well-positioned to accelerate our market share gains through our Total Home strategy.\nOPERATIONS\nThe following tables set forth the percentage relationship to net sales of each line item of the consolidated statements of earnings, as well as the percentage change in dollar amounts from the prior year.  This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nThe following table sets forth key metrics utilized by management in assessing business performance. This table should be read in conjunction with the following discussion and analysis and the consolidated financial statements, including the related notes to the consolidated financial statements.\n1\nA comparable location is defined as a retail location that has been open longer than 13 months.  A location that is identified for relocation is no longer considered comparable in the month of its relocation.  The relocated location must then remain open longer than 13 months to be considered comparable.  A location we have decided to close is no longer considered comparable as of the beginning of the month in which we announce its closing.  Comparable sales include online sales, which positively impacted the comparable sales increase in fiscal 2021, fiscal 2020, and fiscal 2019 by approximately 150 basis points, 565 basis points, and 25 basis points, respectively.\n2\nAverage ticket is defined as net sales divided by the total number of customer transactions.\n3\nAverage store size selling square feet is defined as sales floor square feet divided by the number of stores open at the end of the period.  The average Lowe’s-branded home improvement store has approximately 112,000 square feet of retail selling space.\n4\nReturn on average assets is defined as net earnings divided by average total assets for the last five quarters.\n5\nReturn on invested capital is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure.  Net earnings to average debt and shareholders’ (deficit)/equity is the most comparable GAAP ratio.  See below for additional information and reconciliations of non-GAAP measures.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted Diluted Earnings Per Share\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share is a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes this non-GAAP financial measure provides useful insight for analysts and investors in evaluating what management considers the Company’s core financial performance.  Adjusted diluted earnings per share excludes the impact of discrete items, further described below, not contemplated in the Company’s business outlook for fiscal 2020.  Unless otherwise noted, the income tax effect of these adjustments is calculated using the marginal rate for the period.  There were no non-GAAP adjustments in fiscal 2021.\nFiscal 2020 Impacts\n•\nIn the third quarter of fiscal 2020, the Company recognized a $1.1 billion loss on extinguishment of debt in connection with the cash tender offers on an aggregate principal amount of $3.0 billion in outstanding notes (Loss on extinguishment of debt).\n•\nBeginning in the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company began a strategic review of its Canadian operations, and in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company announced additional actions to improve future performance and profitability of its Canadian operations.  As a result of this review and related actions, the Company recognized pre-tax operating costs of $45 million related to inventory write-downs and other closing costs in fiscal 2020 (Canada restructuring).\nAdjusted diluted earnings per share should not be considered an alternative to, or more meaningful indicator of, the Company’s diluted earnings per common share as prepared in accordance with GAAP.  The Company’s methods of determining this non-GAAP financial measure may differ from the method used by other companies and may not be comparable.\nReturn on Invested Capital\nReturn on Invested Capital (ROIC) is calculated using a non-GAAP financial measure.  Management believes ROIC is a meaningful metric for analysts and investors as a measure of how effectively the Company is using capital to generate profits.  Although ROIC is a common financial metric, numerous methods exist for calculating ROIC.  Accordingly, the method used by our management may differ from the methods used by other companies.  We encourage you to understand the methods used by another company to calculate ROIC before comparing its ROIC to ours.\nWe define ROIC as the rolling 12 months’ lease adjusted net operating profit after tax (Lease adjusted NOPAT) divided by the average of current year and prior year ending debt and shareholders’ (deficit)/equity.  Lease adjusted NOPAT is a non-GAAP financial measure, and net earnings is considered to be the most comparable GAAP financial measure.  The calculation of ROIC, together with a reconciliation of net earnings to Lease adjusted NOPAT, is as follows:\n1\nIncome tax adjustment is defined as net operating profit multiplied by the effective tax rate, which was 24.7%, 24.6%, and 23.9% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n2\nAverage debt and shareholders’ (deficit)/equity is defined as average current year and prior year ending debt, including current maturities, short-term borrowings, and operating lease liabilities, plus the average current year and prior year ending total shareholders’ (deficit)/equity.\nFiscal 2021 Compared to Fiscal 2020\nNet Sales –\nNet sales increased 7.4% to $96.3 billion in 2021.  The increase in total sales was driven by comparable sales growth.  Comparable sales increased 6.9% over the same period, driven by an 11.1% increase in comparable average ticket, partially offset by a 4.2% decline in comparable customer transactions.  Comparable sales change during each quarter of the\nfiscal year, as reported, were an increase of 25.9% in the first quarter, decline of 1.7% in the second quarter, increase of 2.2% in the third quarter, and increase of 5.0% in the fourth quarter.\nDuring 2021, we experienced comparable sales increases in eleven of fifteen product categories, led by Electrical, Lumber, and Flooring.  We delivered strong comparable sales in Electrical and Lumber due to strong unit demand from Pro customers, as well as unit price increases driven by inflation.  New product offerings drove strong sales in Flooring, led by Vinyl Flooring.  We experienced lower comparable sales in Paint, Hardware, and Lighting due to cycling prior year DIY demand at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Geographically, all fifteen U.S. regions and Canada experienced positive comparable sales.\nGross Margin\n– Gross margin as a percentage of sales for 2021 increased 29 basis points compared to 2020.  Gross margin was positively impacted by approximately 65 basis points of total rate improvement driven by continued improvement in managing product costs and disciplined pricing strategies, as well as approximately 25 basis points of leverage from higher credit revenue.  These benefits were partially offset by 35 basis points of deleverage due to product mix and 30 basis points of deleverage from supply chain costs.\nSG&A\n– SG&A expense for 2021 leveraged 167 basis points as a percentage of sales compared to 2020.  This was primarily driven by 115 basis points of leverage due to lower COVID-19 related expenses, including additional compensation to hourly front-line associates, emergency paid leave, and cleaning costs; 45 basis points of leverage in retail operating salaries due to increased sales and improved operating efficiencies as a result of our PPI initiatives; and 30 basis points of leverage due to costs associated with the reset of the layout of our U.S. stores in the prior year.  These benefits were partially offset by 20 basis points of deleverage due to the fourth quarter discretionary bonus to front-line associates.\nDepreciation and Amortization\n– Depreciation and amortization expense deleveraged 17 basis points for 2021 as a percentage of sales compared to 2020, driven by ongoing capital investments in store environment, store equipment, and technology projects.  Property, less accumulated depreciation, decreased to $19.1 billion at January 28, 2022, compared to $19.2 billion at January 29, 2021.\nInterest – Net\n– Net interest expense is comprised of the following:\nNet interest expense in 2021 leveraged three basis points primarily as a result of increased sales in the current year, offset by interest expense related to the issuance of $2.0 billion unsecured notes in March 2021 and $2.0 billion unsecured notes in September 2021.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\n– During the third quarter of 2020, we repurchased and retired $3.0 billion aggregate principal amount of our outstanding debt resulting in a loss on extinguishment of debt of $1.1 billion.\nIncome Tax Provision\n– Our effective income tax rate was 24.7% in 2021 compared to 24.6% in 2020.\nFiscal 2020 Compared to Fiscal 2019\nFor a comparison of our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity, and capital resources for the fiscal years ended January 29, 2021 and January 31, 2020, see “\n” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended January 29, 2021, filed with the SEC on March 22, 2021.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources of Liquidity\nCash flows from operations supplemented with our short-term and long-term borrowings, remain sufficient to fund our operations while allowing us to make strategic investments to support long-term growth and return excess cash to shareholders in the form of dividends and share repurchases.  As of January 28, 2022, we held $1.1 billion of cash and cash equivalents, as well as $4.0 billion in undrawn capacity on our revolving credit facilities.  We believe these sources of liquidity and our continued access to the capital markets on both a short-term and long-term basis, as needed, are adequate to fund our operations and investments to grow our business, repay our debt as it becomes due, pay dividends, and fund our share repurchases over the next twelve months.\nAs of January 28, 2022, our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments consist of leases, long-term debt, purchase obligations, and letters of credit.  See\n,\n, and\nof the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements in\n, “Financial Statements and Supplementary Data”, of this Annual Report for amounts outstanding related to leases, long-term debt, and commitments, respectively, as of January 28, 2022.\nCash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities continued to provide the primary source of our liquidity.  The decrease in net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended January 28, 2022, versus the year ended January 29, 2021, was due primarily to changes in working capital, partially offset by higher net earnings.  Accounts payable increased for fiscal 2021 by $466 million compared to an increase of $3.2 billion in fiscal 2020, driving a reduction of $2.7 billion in operating cash flows for fiscal 2021.  Inventory decreased operating cash flow for fiscal 2021 by approximately $1.4 billion compared to a decrease of $3.0 billion for fiscal 2020.  The increase in accounts payable and inventory in the prior year was driven by a ramp up in inventory purchase volume to meet sustained customer demand at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.  In the current year, we have continued to experience sustained demand levels and maintained a higher level of inventory and related accounts payable.  Other operating liabilities decreased $570 million for fiscal 2021 compared to an increase of $813 million in fiscal 2020.  The decrease in other operating liabilities in the current year compared to the prior year is primarily driven by COVID-related accrued discretionary compensation for hourly associates in the prior year and timing of tax payments.\nCash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities primarily consists of transactions related to capital expenditures.\nCapital expenditures\nOur capital expenditures generally consist of investments in our strategic initiatives to enhance our ability to serve customers, improve existing stores, and support expansion plans.  Capital expenditures were $1.9 billion in 2021 and $1.8 billion in 2020.  The following table provides the allocation of capital expenditures for 2021 and 2020:\n1\nIncludes merchandising resets, facility repairs, replacements of IT and store equipment, among other specific efforts.\n2\nRepresents investments related to our strategic focus areas aimed at improving customers’ experience and driving improved performance in the near and long term.\n3\nRepresents expenditures primarily related to land purchases, buildings, and personal property for new store projects and new corporate facilities projects as well as expenditures related to our international operations.\nFor 2022, our capital expenditures forecast is approximately $2.0 billion.  The following table provides the allocation of our fiscal 2022 capital expenditures forecast:\nCash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nNet cash used in financing activities primarily consist of transactions related to our debt, share repurchases, and cash dividend payments.\nTotal Debt\nIn 2021, we issued $4.0 billion of unsecured notes.  This is comprised of $2.0 billion of unsecured notes issued in March 2021 and $2.0 billion of unsecured notes issued in September 2021, the proceeds of which were designated for general corporate purposes.  In April 2021, we also entered into a $1.0 billion unsecured 364-day term loan facility (the 2021 Term Loan), which was repaid during fiscal 2021.  In 2021, we also paid approximately $1.0 billion to retire scheduled debts at maturity.\nIn December 2021, we entered into a $2.0 billion five-year unsecured revolving third amended and restated credit agreement (the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks.  The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company’s amended and restated credit agreement, dated September 10, 2018 (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), to among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to December 2026 and (ii) increase the aggregate availability to a total of $2.0 billion.\nAlso in December 2021, we amended the five-year unsecured revolving credit agreement dated March 23, 2020 (the 2020 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks.  The amendment, among other things, increased the availability of the unsecured revolving credit agreement to $2.0 billion, maturing in March 2025.  Subject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the 2020 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, the Company may increase the combined aggregate availability of both agreements by an additional $1.0 billion.\nThe Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the 2020 Credit Agreement (collectively, the Credit Agreements) support our commercial paper program.  The amount available to be drawn under the Credit Agreements is reduced by the amount of borrowings under our commercial paper program.  There were no outstanding borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program, the 2020 Credit Agreement, or the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of January 28, 2022.  There were no outstanding borrowings under the commercial paper program, the 2020 Credit Agreement, or the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of January 29, 2021.  Total combined availability under the 2020 Credit Agreement and the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement as of January 28, 2022, was $4.0 billion.\nThe Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the 2020 Credit Agreement contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants.  We were in compliance with those covenants at January 28, 2022.\nOur ratio of debt to capital (shareholder’s (deficit)/equity plus debt) was 124.2% and 93.8% as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\nThe following table includes additional information related to our debt for 2021 and 2020:\nShare Repurchases\nWe have an ongoing share repurchase program, authorized by the Company’s Board of Directors, that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions.  We also withhold shares from employees to satisfy tax withholding liabilities on share-based payments.  Shares repurchased are returned to authorized and unissued status.  The following table provides, on a settlement date basis, the total number of shares repurchased, average price paid per share, and the total amount paid for share repurchases for 2021 and 2020:\nAs of January 28, 2022, we had $19.7 billion remaining under our share repurchase program with no expiration date.  For 2022, we expect to repurchase shares totaling approximately $12.0 billion, subject to market conditions.\nDividends\nIn the third quarter of 2021, we increased our quarterly dividend payment by 33% to $0.80 per share.  Our dividend payment dates are established such that dividends are paid in the quarter immediately following the quarter in which they are declared.  The following table provides additional information related to our dividend payments for 2021 and 2020:\nCapital Resources\nWe expect to continue to have access to the capital markets on both short-term and long-term bases when needed for liquidity purposes by issuing commercial paper or new long-term debt.  The availability and the borrowing costs of these funds could be\nadversely affected, however, by a downgrade of our debt ratings or a deterioration of certain financial ratios.  The table below reflects our debt ratings by Standard & Poor’s (S&P) and Moody’s as of March 21, 2022, which is disclosed to provide an enhanced understanding of our sources of liquidity and the effect of our ratings on our cost of funds.  Our debt ratings have enabled, and should continue to enable, us to refinance our debt as it becomes due at favorable rates in capital markets.  Our commercial paper and senior debt ratings may be subject to revision or withdrawal at any time by the assigning rating organization, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nThere are no provisions in any agreements that would require early cash settlement of existing debt or leases as a result of a downgrade in our debt rating or a decrease in our stock price.  In addition, we do not believe it will be necessary to repatriate significant cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments held in foreign affiliates to fund domestic operations.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements presented in this Annual Report requires us to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  We base these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nOur significant accounting policies are described in\n1\nto the consolidated financial statements included herein.  We believe that the following accounting policies affect the most significant estimates and management judgments used in preparing the consolidated financial statements.\nMerchandise Inventory\nDescription\nWe record an obsolete inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on our current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends and historical experience.  During 2021, our reserve decreased approximately $14 million to $168 million as of January 28, 2022.\nWe also record an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  During 2021, the inventory shrink reserve increased approximately $49 million to $414 million as of January 28, 2022, in response to higher volumes and estimated shrinkage rates based on results from previous physical inventories.\nIn addition, we receive funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments or promotions of vendors’ products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental and identifiable costs that we incurred to sell the vendor’s product.  Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter.  The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned.  As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nWe do not believe that our merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and we have the ability to adjust purchasing practices based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns or a deterioration in product quality could result in the need for additional reserves.  Likewise, changes in the estimated shrink reserve may be necessary, based on the timing and results of physical inventories.  We also apply judgment in the determination of levels of obsolete inventory and assumptions about net realizable value.\nFor vendor funds, we develop accrual rates based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, we perform analyses and review historical purchase trends and volumes throughout the year, adjust accrual rates as appropriate and confirm actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are\nappropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our inventory valuation or the related reserves for obsolete inventory or inventory shrinkage during the past three fiscal years.  We believe that we have sufficient current and historical knowledge to record reasonable estimates for both of these inventory reserves.  However, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded reserves.  A 10% change in either the amount of products considered obsolete or the weighted average estimated loss rate used in the calculation of our obsolete inventory reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $13 million for 2021.  A 10% change in the estimated shrinkage rate included in the calculation of our inventory shrink reserve would have affected net earnings by approximately $31 million for 2021.\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to recognize vendor funds during the past three fiscal years.  If actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and estimates used, we could be exposed to additional adjustments that could positively or negatively impact gross margin and inventory.  However, substantially all receivables associated with these activities do not require subjective long-term estimates because they are collected within the following fiscal year.  Adjustments to gross margin and inventory in the following fiscal year have historically not been material.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\nDescription\nWe review the carrying amounts of locations whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  When evaluating locations for impairment, our asset group is at an individual location level, as that is the lowest level for which cash flows are identifiable.  Cash flows for individual locations do not include an allocation of corporate overhead.\nWe evaluate locations for triggering events relating to long-lived asset impairment on a quarterly basis to determine when a location’s assets may not be recoverable.  For operating locations, our primary indicator that assets may not be recoverable is consistently negative cash flow for a twelve month period for those locations that have been open in the same location for a sufficient period of time to allow for meaningful analysis of ongoing operating results.  Management also monitors other factors when evaluating operating locations for impairment, including individual locations’ execution of their operating plans and local market conditions, including incursion, which is the opening of either other Lowe’s locations or those of a direct competitor within the same market.  We also consider there to be a triggering event when there is a current expectation that it is more likely than not that a given location will be closed or otherwise disposed of significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.\nA potential impairment has occurred if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the location’s assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets.  The carrying value of a location’s asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets and operating liabilities including inventory payables, salaries payable and operating lease liabilities.   Financial and nonoperating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group.  When determining the stream of projected future cash flows associated with an individual operating location, management makes assumptions, incorporating local market conditions, about key store variables including sales growth rates, gross margin and controllable expenses, such as store payroll and operating expense, as well as asset residual values or lease rates.  Operating lease payments are included in the projected future cash flows.  Financing lease payments are excluded from the projected future cash flows.  An impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of the operating location is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.\nWe use an income approach to determine the fair value of our individual operating locations, which requires discounting projected future cash flows.  This involves making assumptions regarding both a location’s future cash flows, as described above, and an appropriate discount rate to determine the present value of those future cash flows.  We discount our cash flow estimates at a rate commensurate with the risk that selected market participants would assign to the cash flows.  The selected market participants represent a group of other retailers with a market footprint similar in size to ours.\nWe use a market approach to determine the fair value of our individual locations identified for closure.  This involves making assumptions regarding the estimated selling prices or estimated lease rates by obtaining information from property brokers or appraisers in the specific markets being evaluated.  The information includes comparable sales of similar assets and assumptions about demand in the market for purchase or lease of these assets.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nOur impairment evaluations require us to apply judgment in determining whether a triggering event has occurred, including the evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its previously estimated useful life.  Our impairment loss calculations require us to apply judgment in estimating expected future cash flows, including estimated sales, margin, and controllable expenses, assumptions about market performance for operating locations, and estimated selling prices or lease rates for locations identified for closure.  We also apply judgment in estimating asset fair values, including the selection of an appropriate discount rate for fair values determined using an income approach.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nDuring fiscal years 2021 and 2020, long-lived asset impairment recorded within selling, general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of earnings was immaterial.  We have not made any material changes in the methodology used to estimate the future cash flows of operating locations or locations identified for closure during the past three fiscal years.  If the actual results are not consistent with the assumptions and judgments we have made in determining whether it is more likely than not that a location will be closed significantly before the end of its useful life or in estimating future cash flows and determining asset fair values, our actual impairment losses could vary from our estimated impairment losses.  In the event that our estimates vary from actual results, we may record additional impairment losses, which could be material to our results of operations.\nSelf-Insurance\nDescription\nWe are self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation, automobile, general and product liability, extended protection plans, and certain medical and dental claims.  We have excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from single events and earnings volatility.  Our self-insured retention or deductible, as applicable, is limited to $2 million per occurrence involving workers’ compensation, $10 million per occurrence involving general or product liability, and $10 million per occurrence involving automobile.  We do not have any excess insurance coverage for self-insured extended protection plan or medical and dental claims.  Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon our estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience.  During 2021, our self-insurance liabilities increased approximately $23 million to $1.1 billion as of January 28, 2022.\nJudgments and uncertainties involved in the estimate\nThese estimates are subject to changes in the regulatory environment, utilized discount rate, projected exposures including payroll, sales and vehicle units, as well as the frequency, lag and severity of claims.\nEffect if actual results differ from assumptions\nWe have not made any material changes in the methodology used to establish our self-insurance liability during the past three fiscal years.  Although we believe that we have the ability to reasonably estimate losses related to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities.  A 10% change in our self-insurance liability would have affected net earnings by approximately $84 million for 2021.  A 100 basis point change in our discount rate would have affected net earnings by approximately $23 million for 2021."

    "text": "In addition to the risks inherent in our operations, we are exposed to certain market risks, including changes in interest rates, commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe use forward starting interest rate swaps to hedge our exposure to the impact of interest rate changes in future debt issuances.  The fair value of our derivative financial instruments as of January 28, 2022, was not material.  Fluctuations in interest rates do not have a material impact on our financial condition and results of operations because our long-term debt is carried at amortized cost and consists primarily of fixed-rate instruments.  Therefore, providing quantitative information about interest rate risk is not meaningful for our financial instruments.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe purchase certain commodity products that are subject to price volatility caused by factors beyond our control, which could potentially have a material impact on our financial condition and/or results of operations.  We believe that the price volatility of these products is partially mitigated by our ability to adjust selling prices.  The selling prices of these commodity products are influenced, in part, by the market price we pay and our competitive environment.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nAlthough we have international operating entities, our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations is not material to our financial condition and result of operations."

    "text": "MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nManagement of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and its subsidiaries is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (Internal Control) as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  Our Internal Control was designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation and fair presentation of published financial statements.\nAll internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations, including the possibility of human error and the circumvention or overriding of controls.  Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to the reliability of financial reporting and financial statement preparation and presentation.  Further, because of changes in conditions, the effectiveness may vary over time.\nOur management, with the participation of the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, evaluated the effectiveness of our Internal Control as of January 28, 2022.  In evaluating our Internal Control, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013).  Based on our management’s assessment, we have concluded that, as of January 28, 2022, our Internal Control is effective.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, the independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements contained in this Annual Report, was engaged to audit our Internal Control.  Their report appears on page\n.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lowe’s Companies, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, the related consolidated statements of earnings, comprehensive income, shareholders’ (deficit)/equity, and cash flows, for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 28, 2022, and the related notes and the schedule listed in the Index at Item 15 (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three fiscal years in the period ended January 28, 2022, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated March 21, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nMerchandise Inventory – Vendor Funds – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company receives funds from its vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes and sales. In the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022, the Company purchased inventory from a significant number of vendors. Many of the vendor funds associated with these purchases are earned under agreements that are negotiated on an annual basis or shorter. The funds are recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory as they are earned. As the related inventory is sold, the amounts are recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.\nWe identified vendor funds as a critical audit matter because of the volume and varying terms of the individual vendor agreements. This required an increased extent of effort when performing audit procedures to evaluate whether the vendor funds were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to whether the vendor funds were recorded in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over vendor funds, including management’s controls over the accrual and recording of vendor funds as a reduction to the cost of inventory or cost of sales in accordance with the terms of the vendor agreements.\n•\nWe selected a sample of vendor funds and recalculated the amount earned using the terms of the vendor agreement, including the amount recorded as a reduction to the cost of inventory and/or the amount recorded as a reduction to cost of sales.\n•\nWe selected a sample of vendor funds and confirmed the amount earned and terms of the agreement directly with the vendor.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nMarch 21, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1962.\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Lowe’s Companies, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Lowe’s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of January 28, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 28, 2022, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control\n–\nIntegrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022, of the Company and our report dated March 21, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nMarch 21, 2022\nLowe’s Companies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\n(In millions, except per share and percentage data)\nLowe’s Companies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n(In millions, except percentage data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nLowe’s Companies, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(In millions, except par value)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nLowe’s Companies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ (Deficit)/Equity\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nLowe’s Companies, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nYEARS ENDED JANUARY 28, 2022, JANUARY 29, 2021, AND JANUARY 31, 2020\nNOTE 1:\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nLowe’s Companies, Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) is the world’s second-largest home improvement retailer and operated\n1,971\nstores in the United States and Canada at January 28, 2022.  Below are those accounting policies considered by the Company to be significant.\nFiscal Year -\nThe Company’s fiscal year ends on the Friday nearest the end of January.  Each of the fiscal years presented contained 52 weeks.  All references herein for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019 represent the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n- The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned or controlled operating subsidiaries.  All intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nImpacts of COVID-19 -\nOn March 11, 2020, the World Health Organization declared the novel strain of coronavirus (COVID-19) a pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide.  In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, restrictions were put in place in an attempt to control the spread of the disease.  At the onset of the pandemic, the Company implemented a number of measures to facilitate a safer store environment and to provide support for its associates, customers and community.  Beginning in fiscal 2020, the Company expanded associate benefits in response to COVID-19 to provide additional paid time off, special payments to hourly associates, temporary wage increases and other benefits, which continued through 2021.  The Company also continued enhanced cleaning protocols.  These actions resulted in $\n162\nmillion and $\n1.2\nbillion of expense included in selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the consolidated statements of earnings for the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\nIn addition, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the CARES Act), which was enacted on March 27, 2020, included measures to assist companies in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  In accordance with the CARES Act, the Company deferred the payments of qualifying employer payroll taxes which were required to be paid over\ntwo years\n, with half due by December 31, 2021, and the other half due by December 31, 2022.  These amounts are included in cash flows from other operating liabilities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nThe following table presents the qualifying employer payroll taxes deferred in accordance with the CARES Act along with the location in the consolidated balance sheets:\nForeign Currency\n- The functional currencies of the Company’s international subsidiaries are generally the local currencies of the countries in which the subsidiaries are located.  Foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.  Results of operations and cash flows are translated using the average exchange rates throughout the period.  The effect of exchange rate fluctuations on translation of assets and liabilities is included as a component of shareholders’ (deficit)/equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss.  Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are included in SG&A expense.\nUse of Estimates\n- The preparation of the Company’s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, sales and expenses, and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities.  The Company bases these estimates on historical results and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, all of which form the basis for making estimates concerning the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n- Cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits, and short-term investments with original maturities of three months or less when purchased.  Cash and cash equivalents are carried at amortized cost on the consolidated balance sheets.  The majority of payments due from financial institutions for the settlement of credit card and debit card transactions process within two business days and are, therefore, classified as cash and cash equivalents.\nInvestments\n- Investments generally consist of agency securities, commercial paper, corporate debt securities, governmental securities, and money market funds, which are classified as available-for-sale.  Available-for-sale debt securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe proceeds from sales of available-for-sale debt securities were $\n308\nmillion, $\n42\nmillion, and $\n121\nmillion for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  Gross realized gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale debt securities were not significant for any of the periods presented.\nInvestments with a stated maturity date of one year or less from the balance sheet date or that are expected to be used in current operations are classified as short-term investments.  All other investments are classified as long-term.  Investments classified as long-term at January 28, 2022, will mature in\none\nto\nthree years\n, based on stated maturity dates.\nThe Company classifies as investments restricted balances primarily pledged as collateral for the Company’s extended protection plan program.\nRestricted balances included in short-term investments were $\n271\nmillion at January 28, 2022, and $\n506\nmillion at January 29, 2021.  Restricted balances included in long-term investments were $\n199\nmillion at January 28, 2022, and $\n200\nmillion at January 29, 2021.\nMerchandise Inventory\n- The majority of the Company’s inventory is stated at the lower of cost and net realizable value using the first-in, first-out method of inventory accounting.  Inventory for certain subsidiaries representing approximately\n7\n% of the consolidated inventory balances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, are stated at lower of cost and net realizable value using the weighted average cost method.  The cost of inventory includes certain costs associated with the preparation of inventory for resale, including distribution center costs, and is net of vendor funds.\nThe Company records an inventory reserve for the anticipated loss associated with selling inventories below cost.  This reserve is based on management’s current knowledge with respect to inventory levels, sales trends, and historical experience.  Management does not believe the Company’s merchandise inventories are subject to significant risk of obsolescence in the near term, and management has the ability to adjust purchasing patterns based on anticipated sales trends and general economic conditions.  However, changes in consumer purchasing patterns could result in the need for additional reserves.\nThe Company also records an inventory reserve for the estimated shrinkage between physical inventories.  This reserve is based primarily on actual shrink results from previous physical inventories.  Changes in the estimated shrink reserve are made based on the timing and results of physical inventories.\nThe Company receives funds from vendors in the normal course of business, principally as a result of purchase volumes, sales, early payments, or promotions of vendors’ products.  Generally, these vendor funds do not represent the reimbursement of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred by the Company to sell the vendor’s product.  Therefore, the Company treats these funds as a reduction in the cost of inventory and are recognized as a reduction of cost of sales when the inventory is sold.  Funds that are determined to be reimbursements of specific, incremental, and identifiable costs incurred to sell vendors’ products are recorded as an offset to the related expense.  The Company develops accrual rates for vendor funds based on the provisions of the agreements in place.  Due to the diversity of the individual vendor agreements, the Company performs analyses and reviews historical trends throughout the year and confirms actual amounts with select vendors to ensure the amounts earned are appropriately recorded.  Amounts accrued throughout the year could be impacted if actual purchase volumes differ from projected annual purchase volumes, especially in the case of programs that provide for increased funding when graduated purchase volumes are met.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n- The Company is exposed to the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates, benchmark interest rates, and the prices of commodities used in the normal course of business.  The Company occasionally utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage certain business risks.  All derivative financial instruments are recognized at their fair values as either assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date and reported on a gross basis.\nThe Company held forward interest rate swap agreements to hedge its exposure to changes in benchmark interest rates on forecasted debt issuances as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.  The cash flows related to forward interest rate swap agreements are included within operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.  The Company accounts for these contracts as cash flow hedges, thus the effective portion of gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income, net of tax effects, in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income and are recognized in earnings when the underlying hedged transaction impacts the consolidated statements of earnings.\nThe Company held fixed-to-floating interest rate swap agreements as fair value hedges on certain debt as of January 28, 2022.  The Company evaluates the effectiveness of the fair value hedges using the shortcut method of accounting under which the hedges are assumed to be perfectly effective.  Thus, the change in fair value of the derivative instruments offsets the change in\nfair value on the hedged debt, and there is no net impact in the consolidated statements of earnings from the fair value of the derivatives.\nTo hedge the economic risk of changes in value of the October 2020 cash tender offers prior to its pricing date, the Company entered into reverse treasury lock derivative contracts which were not designated as hedging instruments.  The cash flows related to these contracts are included within financing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nCredit Programs and Sale of Business Accounts Receivable\n- The Company has branded and private label proprietary credit cards which generate sales that are not reflected in receivables.  Under an agreement with Synchrony Bank (Synchrony), credit is extended directly to customers by Synchrony.  All credit program-related services are performed and controlled directly by Synchrony.  The Company has the option, but no obligation, to purchase the receivables at the end of the agreement.\nThe Company also has an agreement with Synchrony under which Synchrony purchases at face value commercial business accounts receivable originated by the Company and services these accounts.  The Company primarily accounts for these transfers as sales of the accounts receivable.  When the Company transfers its commercial business accounts receivable, it retains certain interests in those receivables, including the funding of a loss reserve and its obligation related to Synchrony’s ongoing servicing of the receivables sold.  Any gain or loss on the sale is determined based on the previous carrying amounts of the transferred assets allocated at fair value between the receivables sold and the interests retained.  Fair value is based on the present value of expected future cash flows, taking into account the key assumptions of anticipated credit losses, payment rates, late fee rates, Synchrony’s servicing costs, and the discount rate commensurate with the uncertainty involved.  Due to the short-term nature of the receivables sold, changes to the key assumptions would not materially impact the recorded gain or loss on the sales of receivables or the fair value of the retained interests in the receivables.\nTotal commercial business accounts receivable sold to Synchrony were $\n4.3\nbillion in 2021, $\n3.3\nbillion in 2020, and $\n3.2\nbillion in 2019.  The Company recognized losses of $\n50\nmillion in 2021, $\n54\nmillion in 2020, and $\n41\nmillion in 2019 on these receivable sales, which primarily relates to servicing costs that are remitted to Synchrony monthly.\nProperty and Depreciation\n- Property is recorded at cost.  Costs associated with major additions are capitalized and depreciated.  Capital assets are expected to yield future benefits and have original useful lives which exceed one year.  The total cost of a capital asset generally includes all applicable sales taxes, delivery costs, installation costs, and other appropriate costs incurred by the Company, including interest in the case of self-constructed assets.  Upon disposal, the cost of properties and related accumulated depreciation is removed from the accounts, with gains and losses reflected in SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nProperty consists of land, buildings and building improvements, equipment, finance lease assets, and construction in progress.  Buildings and building improvements includes owned buildings, as well as buildings under finance lease and leasehold improvements.  Equipment primarily includes store racking and displays, computer hardware and software, forklifts, vehicles, finance lease equipment, and other store equipment\n.\nIn addition, excess properties held for use are included within land and buildings.\nDepreciation is recognized over the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets.  Assets are depreciated using the straight-line method.  Leasehold improvements and finance lease assets are depreciated and amortized, respectively, over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.  The amortization of these assets is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment\n-\nThe carrying amounts of long-lived assets are reviewed whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.  A potential impairment has occurred for long-lived assets held-for-use if projected future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the assets are less than the carrying amounts of the assets.  The carrying value of a location’s asset group includes inventory, property, operating and finance lease right-of-use assets, and operating liabilities, including inventory payables, salaries payable and operating lease liabilities.  Financial and non-operating liabilities are excluded from the carrying value of the asset group.  An impairment loss is recorded for long-lived assets held-for-use when the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value.  Impairment losses are included in SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nExcess properties that are expected to be sold within the next twelve months and meet the other relevant held-for-sale criteria are classified as long-lived assets held-for-sale.  Excess properties consist primarily of retail outparcels and property associated with relocated or closed locations.  An impairment loss is recorded for long-lived assets held-for-sale when the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value less cost to sell.  A long-lived asset is not depreciated while it is classified as held-for-sale.\nFor long-lived assets to be abandoned, the Company considers the asset to be disposed of when it ceases to be used.  Until it ceases to be used, the Company continues to classify the asset as held-for-use and tests for potential impairment accordingly.  If the Company commits to a plan to abandon a long-lived asset before the end of its previously estimated useful life, its depreciable life is evaluated.\nGoodwill\n- Goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, less liabilities assumed, in a business combination.  The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is the operating segment level or one level below the operating segment level.  Goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated for impairment at least annually on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The evaluation begins with a qualitative assessment to determine whether a quantitative impairment test is necessary.  If, after assessing qualitative factors, we determine it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount, then the quantitative goodwill impairment test is performed.\nThe quantitative goodwill impairment test used to identify potential impairment compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, including goodwill.  Fair value represents the price a market participant would be willing to pay in a potential sale of the reporting unit and is based on a combination of an income approach, based on discounted future cash flows, and a market approach, based on market multiples applied to free cash flow.  If the fair value exceeds carrying value, then no goodwill impairment has occurred.  If the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit.  Any impairment identified is included within SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.  The income tax effect from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit, if applicable, is considered in determining the goodwill impairment loss.\nA reporting unit is an operating segment or a business unit one level below that operating segment, for which discrete financial information is prepared and regularly reviewed by segment management.  During fiscal 2021, goodwill was allocated to the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit.  In fiscal 2021, we completed our annual qualitative assessment of the recoverability of goodwill for the U.S. Home Improvement reporting unit and concluded that the fair value of the reporting unit significantly exceeded its carrying value.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\nGross carrying amounts and cumulative goodwill impairment losses are as follows:\nOther Intangible Assets -\nIntangible assets with indefinite lives are evaluated for impairment on the first day of the fourth quarter or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.  The cost of definite-lived intangible assets is amortized over their estimated useful lives, which range up to\n20\nyears.  Intangible assets are recorded within other assets on the consolidated balance sheets.\nLeases\n- The Company leases certain retail stores, warehouses, distribution centers, office space, land and equipment under finance and operating leases.  Lease commencement occurs on the date the Company takes possession or control of the property or equipment.  Original terms for facility-related leases are generally between\nfive\nand\n20\nyears.  These leases generally contain provisions for\nfour\nto\nsix\nrenewal options of\nfive years\neach.  Original terms for equipment-related leases, primarily material handling equipment and vehicles, are generally between\none\nand\nseven years\n.  Some of the Company’s leases also include rental escalation clauses and/or termination provisions.  Renewal options and termination options are included in the determination of lease payments when management determines the options are reasonably certain of exercise, considering\nfinancial performance, strategic importance and/or invested capital.  Leases with an original term of twelve months or less are not recognized on the Company’s balance sheet, and the lease expense related to those short-term leases is recognized over the lease term.  The Company does not account for lease and non-lease (e.g. common area maintenance) components of contracts separately for any underlying asset class.\nIf readily determinable, the rate implicit in the lease is used to discount lease payments to present value; however, substantially all of the Company’s leases do not provide a readily determinable implicit rate.  When the implicit rate is not determinable, the Company’s estimated incremental borrowing rate is utilized, determined on a collateralized basis, to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement.\nThe Company’s real estate leases typically require payment of common area maintenance and real estate taxes which represent the majority of variable lease costs.  Certain lease agreements also provide for variable rental payments based on sales performance in excess of specified minimums, usage measures, or changes in the consumer price index.  Variable rent payments based on future performance, usage, or changes in indices were not significant for any of the periods presented.  Variable lease costs are excluded from the present value of lease obligations.\nThe Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material restrictions, covenants, or any material residual value guarantees.  The Company subleases certain properties that are not used in its operations.  Sublease income was not significant for any of the periods presented.\nAccounts Payable -\nThe Company has agreements with third parties to provide accounts payable tracking systems which facilitate participating suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations from the Company with designated third-party financial institutions.  Participating suppliers may, at their sole discretion, make offers to finance one or more payment obligations of the Company prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price to participating financial institutions.  The Company’s goal in entering into these arrangements is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing, payment terms, or vendor funding, created by facilitating suppliers’ ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates, while providing them with greater working capital flexibility.\nThe Company’s obligations to its suppliers, including amounts due and scheduled payment dates, are not impacted by suppliers’ decisions to finance amounts under these arrangements.  However, the Company’s right to offset balances due from suppliers against payment obligations is restricted by these arrangements for those payment obligations that have been financed by suppliers.\nThe Company’s outstanding payment obligations with participating suppliers were $\n3.0\nbillion as of January 28, 2022, and $\n2.5\nbillion as of January 29, 2021, and are included in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets, and participating suppliers financed $\n2.3\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion, respectively, of those payment obligations to participating financial institutions.  Total payment obligations that were placed and settled on the accounts payable tracking systems were $\n11.0\nbillion and $\n9.7\nbillion for each of the years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.\nOther Current Liabilities\n- Other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets consist of:\nSelf-Insurance\n- The Company is self-insured for certain losses relating to workers’ compensation, automobile, property, and general and product liability claims.  The Company has excess insurance coverage above certain retention amounts to limit exposure from these claims.  The Company is also self-insured for certain losses relating to extended protection plans, as well as medical and dental claims.  Self-insurance claims filed and claims incurred but not reported are accrued based upon management’s estimates of the discounted ultimate cost for self-insured claims incurred using actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and historical experience.  Although management believes it has the ability to reasonably estimate losses\nrelated to claims, it is possible that actual results could differ from recorded self-insurance liabilities.  Total self-insurance liabilities, including the current and non-current portions, were $\n1.1\nbillion at January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.\nThe Company provides surety bonds issued by insurance companies to secure payment of workers’ compensation liabilities as required in certain states where the Company is self-insured.\nOutstanding surety bonds relating to self-insurance were $\n270\nmillion at January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.\nIncome Taxes\n- The Company establishes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the tax and financial accounting bases of assets and liabilities.  The tax effects of such differences are reflected in the consolidated balance sheets at the enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the differences reverse.  A valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the asset will not be realized.  The tax balances and income tax expense recognized by the Company are based on management’s interpretation of the tax statutes of multiple jurisdictions.\nThe Company establishes a liability for tax positions for which there is uncertainty as to whether or not the position will be ultimately sustained.  The Company includes interest related to tax issues as part of net interest on the consolidated statements of earnings.  The Company records any applicable penalties related to tax issues within the income tax provision.\nShareholders’ (Deficit)/Equity -\nThe Company has a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private market transactions.  Shares purchased under the repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status.  Any excess of cost over par value is charged to additional paid-in capital to the extent that a balance is present.  Once additional paid-in capital is fully depleted, remaining excess of cost over par value is charged to (accumulated deficit)/retained earnings.\nRevenue Recognition -\nThe Company recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services.  A description of the Company’s principle revenue generating activities is as follows:\n•\nProducts -\nRevenue from products primarily relates to in-store and online merchandise purchases, which are recognized at the point in time when the customer obtains control of the merchandise.  This occurs at the time of in-store purchase or delivery of the product to the customer.  A provision for anticipated merchandise returns is provided through a reduction of sales and cost of sales in the period that the related sales are recorded.  The merchandise return reserve is presented on a gross basis, with a separate asset and liability included in the consolidated balance sheets.\n•\nServices\n-\nRevenues from services primarily relate to professional installation services the Company provides through subcontractors related to merchandise purchased by a customer.  In certain instances, installation services include materials provided by the subcontractor, and both product and installation are included in service revenue.  The Company recognizes revenue associated with services as they are rendered, and the majority of services are completed within one week from initiation.\nRetail deferred revenue consists of amounts received for which customers have not yet taken possession of the merchandise or for which installation has not yet been completed.  Deferred revenue is recognized in sales either at a point in time when the customer obtains control of merchandise through pickup or delivery, or over time as services are provided to the customer.  The majority of revenue for goods and services is recognized in the quarter following revenue deferral.  In addition, the Company defers revenues from stored-value cards, which include gift cards and returned merchandise credits, and recognizes revenue into sales when the cards are redeemed.\nThe Company also defers revenues for its separately-priced long-term protection plan contracts (Lowe’s protection plans), which is a Lowe’s-branded program for which the Company is ultimately self-insured.  The Company recognizes revenue from Lowe’s protection plan sales on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term.  Expenses for claims are recognized in cost of sales when incurred.  Incremental direct acquisition costs associated with the sale of Lowe’s protection plans for contracts greater than one year are also deferred and recognized as expense on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term.  Lowe’s protection plan contract terms primarily range from\none\nto\nfive years\nfrom the date of purchase or the end of the manufacturer’s warranty, as applicable.\nCost of Sales\nand\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses -\nThe following lists the primary costs classified in each major expense category:\nAdvertising\n- Costs associated with advertising are charged to expense as incurred.\nAdvertising expenses were $\n877\nmillion, $\n798\nmillion, and $\n871\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nComprehensive Income\n- The Company reports comprehensive income in its consolidated statements of comprehensive income and consolidated statements of shareholders’ (deficit)/equity.  Comprehensive income represents changes in shareholders’ (deficit)/equity from non-owner sources and is comprised of net earnings adjusted primarily for foreign currency translation adjustments and cash flow hedge derivative contracts.\nNet foreign currency translation losses, net of tax, classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss were $\n41\nmillion, $\n37\nmillion, and $\n115\nmillion at January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.  Net cash flow hedge (gains)/losses, net of tax, classified in accumulated other comprehensive loss were ($\n6\n) million, $\n103\nmillion, and $\n24\nmillion at January 28, 2022, January 29, 2021, and January 31, 2020, respectively.\nSegment Information\n- The Company’s home improvement retail operations represent a single reportable segment.  Key operating decisions are made at the Company level in order to maintain a consistent retail customer experience.  The Company’s home improvement retail and hardware stores, in addition to online selling channels, sell similar products and services, use similar processes to sell those products and services, and sell their products and services to similar classes of customers.  In addition, the Company’s operations exhibit similar long-term economic characteristics.\nThe amounts of long-lived assets and net sales outside of the U.S. were approximately\n7.2\n% and\n6.1\n%, respectively, at January 28, 2022.  The amounts of long-lived assets and net sales outside of the U.S. were approximately\n7.5\n% and\n5.9\n%, respectively, at January 29, 2021.  The amounts of long-lived assets and net sales outside of the U.S. were approximately\n7.7\n% and\n6.9\n%, respectively, at January 31, 2020.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\n- Recent accounting pronouncements pending adoption not discussed in this Form 10-K are either not applicable to the Company or are not expected to have a material impact on the Company.\nNOTE 2:\nRevenue\nNet sales consists primarily of revenue, net of sales tax, associated with contracts with customers for the sale of goods and services in amounts that reflect consideration the Company is entitled to in exchange for those goods and services.\nThe following table presents the Company’s sources of revenue:\nThe balances and classification within the consolidated balance sheets for anticipated sales returns and the associated right of return assets are as follows:\nDeferred revenue - retail and stored-value cards\nDeferred revenue for retail and stored-value cards are as follows:\nDeferred revenue - Lowe’s protection plans\nDeferred revenue associated with Lowe’s protection plans is as follows:\nLowe’s protection plan sales previously recorded as deferred revenue and claim expenses incurred are as follows:\nDisaggregation of Revenues\nThe following table presents the Company’s net sales disaggregated by merchandise division:\nNote:  Merchandise division net sales for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n1\nHome Décor includes the following product categories: Appliances, Décor, Flooring, Kitchens & Bath, and Paint\n2\nBuilding Products includes the following product categories: Building Materials, Electrical, Lighting, Lumber, Millwork, and Rough Plumbing\n3\nHardlines includes the following product categories: Hardware, Lawn & Garden, Seasonal & Outdoor Living, and Tools\nThe following table presents the Company’s net sales disaggregated by geographical area:\nNOTE 3:\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date.  The authoritative guidance for fair value measurements establishes a three-level hierarchy, which encourages an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value.  The three levels of the hierarchy are defined as follows:\n•\nLevel 1\n-\ninputs to the valuation techniques that are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities\n•\nLevel 2\n-\ninputs to the valuation techniques that are other than quoted prices but are observable for the assets or liabilities, either directly or indirectly\n•\nLevel 3\n-\ninputs to the valuation techniques that are unobservable for the assets or liabilities\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial assets and financial liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThere were no transfers between Levels 1, 2, or 3 during any of the periods presented.\nWhen available, quoted prices were used to determine fair value.  When quoted prices in active markets were available, investments were classified within Level 1 of the fair value hierarchy.  When quoted prices in active markets were not available, fair values were determined using pricing models, and the inputs to those pricing models were based on observable market inputs.  The inputs to the pricing models were typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, issuer spreads and benchmark securities, among others.\nAssets and Liabilities that are Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nFor the fiscal years ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, the Company had no material measurements of assets and liabilities at fair value on a nonrecurring basis subsequent to their initial recognition.\nOther Fair Value Disclosures\nThe Company’s financial assets and liabilities not measured at fair value on a recurring basis include cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and long-term debt and are reflected in the financial statements at cost.  With the exception of long-term debt, cost approximates fair value for these items due to their short-term nature.  As further described in\n, certain long-term debt is associated with a fair value hedge, and the changes in fair value of the hedged debt is included in the carrying value of long-term debt on the consolidated balance sheets.  The fair values of the Company’s unsecured notes were estimated using quoted market prices.  The fair values of the Company’s mortgage notes were estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, based on the future cash outflows associated with these arrangements and discounted using the applicable incremental borrowing rate.\nCarrying amounts and the related estimated fair value of the Company’s long-term debt, excluding finance lease obligations, are as follows:\nNOTE 4:\nProperty and Accumulated Depreciation\nProperty is summarized by major class in the following table:\nIncluded in property, less accumulated depreciation are right-of-use assets under finance leases.  The related amortization expense for right-of-use assets under finance leases is included in depreciation and amortization expense.  The Company recognized depreciation and amortization expense, inclusive of amounts presented in cost of sales, of $\n1.8\nbillion in 2021, $\n1.5\nbillion in 2020, and $\n1.4\nbillion in 2019.\nNOTE 5:\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nThe carrying amount of goodwill as well as the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of intangible assets consist of the following:\n1\nCertain definite-lived intangible assets are denominated in a foreign currency and subject to translation.\n2\nIn April 2021, the Company acquired the STAINMASTER\n®\nbrand for total consideration of $\n134\nmillion, which was determined to have an indefinite life.\nAmortization expense for intangible assets is as follows:\nAmortization expense expected to be recognized in future periods for intangible assets is as follows:\nNOTE 6:\nLeases\nThe lease-related assets and liabilities recorded on the balance sheet are summarized in the following table:\n1\nFinance lease assets are recorded net of accumulated amortization of $\n206\nmillion as of January 28, 2022, and $\n122\nmillion as of January 29, 2021.\nThe table below presents the lease costs for finance and operating leases:\n1\nIncludes short-term leases and sublease income, which are immaterial.\nThe future minimum rental payments required under operating and finance lease obligations as of January 28, 2022, having initial or remaining non-cancelable lease terms in excess of one year are summarized as follows:\n1\nOperating lease payments include $\n268\nmillion related to options to extend lease terms that are reasonably certain of being exercised and exclude $\n638\nmillion of minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.\n2\nFinance lease payments exclude $\n6\nmillion of minimum lease payments for leases signed but not yet commenced.\n3\nCalculated using the lease-specific incremental borrowing rate.\n4\nIncludes the current portion of $\n636\nmillion for operating leases and $\n103\nmillion for finance leases.\n1\nExcludes $\n638\nmillion of leases signed but not yet commenced as of January 28, 2022.\nNOTE 7:\nExit Activities\nDuring fiscal years 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred costs associated with an ongoing strategic reassessment of its business to drive an increased focus on its core home improvement operations and to improve overall operating performance and profitability.  As a result of this reassessment, the Company decided to exit certain activities and close certain locations as further described below.  Expenses associated with long-lived asset impairment, severance, and other closing costs are included in SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.  Expenses associated with accelerated depreciation are included in depreciation and amortization expense in the consolidated statements of earnings.\nCanada Restructuring\nDuring the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the Company began a strategic review of its Canadian operations, and as a result, recognized pre-tax charges of $\n53\nmillion associated with long-lived asset impairment.  Subsequent to the end of the Company’s third quarter of fiscal 2019, a decision was made to close\n34\nunder-performing stores in Canada and take additional\nrestructuring actions to improve future sales and profitability of the Canadian operations.  As a result of these actions, during fiscal 2020, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of $\n35\nmillion.\nA summary of the significant charges associated with the restructuring of the Canadian operations are as follows:\nThe following table summarizes store closing lease obligations activity during the twelve months ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021:\n1\nAdjustments represent lease terminations and changes in estimates around sublease assumptions.\nNOTE 8:\nDebt\nCommercial Paper Program\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into a $\n2.0\nbillion\nfive-year\nunsecured revolving third amended and restated credit agreement (the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks.  The Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement amends and restates the Company’s amended and restated credit agreement, dated September 10, 2018 (the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement), to among other things (i) extend the maturity date of the revolving credit facility to December 2026 and (ii) increase the aggregate availability to a total of $\n2.0\nbillion.  Borrowings under the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement will bear interest calculated according to a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate, plus an applicable margin.\nAlso in December 2021, the Company amended the\nfive-year\nunsecured revolving credit agreement dated March 23, 2020 (the 2020 Credit Agreement) with a syndicate of banks.  The amendment, among other things, increased the availability of the unsecured revolving credit agreement to $\n2.0\nbillion, maturing in March 2025.  Borrowings under the 2020 Credit Agreement will bear interest calculated according to a Base Rate or a Eurocurrency Rate, plus an applicable margin.\nSubject to obtaining commitments from the lenders and satisfying other conditions specified in the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement and the 2020 Credit Agreement (collectively, the Credit Agreements), the Company may increase the combined aggregate availability of both agreements by an additional $\n1.0\nbillion.  The Credit Agreements contain customary representations, warranties, and covenants for transactions of these type.  The Company was in compliance with those financial covenants at January 28, 2022.\nThe Credit Agreements support the Company’s commercial paper program.  The amounts available to be drawn under the Credit Agreements are reduced by the amount of borrowings under the commercial paper program.   There were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program, the Third Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, or the 2020 Credit Agreement as of January 28, 2022.  There were\nno\noutstanding borrowings under the Company’s commercial paper program, the Second Amended and Restated Credit Agreement or the 2020 Credit Agreement as of January 29, 2021.  Total combined availability under the Credit Agreements was $\n4.0\nbillion as of January 28, 2022.\nOther Short-Term Borrowings\nIn April 2021, the Company entered into a $\n1.0\nbillion unsecured\n364-day\nterm loan facility (the 2021 Term Loan), which was scheduled to mature in April 2022, but was repaid early in January 2022.\nLong-Term Debt\n1\nReal properties with an aggregate book value of $\n16\nmillion as of January 28, 2022, were pledged as collateral for secured debt.\nDebt maturities, exclusive of unamortized original issue discounts, unamortized debt issuance costs, fair-value hedge adjustments, and finance lease obligations, for the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows:\nThe Company’s unsecured notes are issued under indentures that generally have similar terms and, therefore, have been grouped by maturity date for presentation purposes in the table above.  The notes contain certain restrictive covenants, none of which are expected to impact the Company’s capital resources or liquidity.  The Company was in compliance with all financial covenants of these agreements at January 28, 2022.\nDuring 2021, the Company issued $\n4.0\nbillion of unsecured fixed rate notes (collectively, the 2021 Notes) as follows:\nInterest on the September 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears in March and September of each year until maturity.  Interest on the March 2021 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears in April and October of each year until maturity.\nDuring 2020, the Company issued $\n8.0\nbillion of unsecured fixed rate notes (collectively, the 2020 Notes) as follows:\nInterest on the 2020 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears in April and October of each year until maturity.\nThe indentures governing the 2021 and 2020 Notes contain a provision that allows the Company to redeem these notes at any time, in whole or in part, at specified redemption prices, plus accrued interest, if any, up to the date of redemption.  The indentures also contain a provision that allows the holders of the notes to require the Company to repurchase all or any part of their notes if a change of control triggering event occurs.  If elected under the change of control provisions, the repurchase of the notes will occur at a purchase price of\n101\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any, on such notes up to the date of purchase.  The indentures governing the notes do not limit the aggregate principal amount of debt securities that the Company may issue and do not require the Company to maintain specified financial ratios or levels of net worth or liquidity.  However, the indentures include various restrictive covenants, none of which is expected to impact the Company’s liquidity or capital resources.\nThe discounts associated with these issuances, which include the underwriting and issuance discounts, are recorded in long-term debt and are being amortized over the respective terms of the notes using the effective interest method.\nDuring 2020, the Company completed cash tender offers to purchase and retire $\n3.0\nbillion combined aggregate principal amount of its outstanding notes with a weighted average interest rate of\n4.80\n%.  As a result of the 2020 cash tender offers, the Company recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n1.1\nbillion which includes premium paid to holders of the debt, unamortized deferred financing fees and original issue discounts, and loss on reverse treasury lock derivative contracts.  See\nfor additional information regarding the reverse treasury lock derivative contracts.\nNOTE 9:\nDerivative Instruments\nDerivatives Designated as Hedging Instruments\nThe notional amounts of the Company’s material derivative instruments are as follows:\nSee\nfor the gross fair values of the Company’s outstanding derivative financial instruments and corresponding fair value classifications.\nThe impact of forward interest rate swap derivatives, both matured and outstanding, designated as cash flow hedges recorded in other comprehensive income and earnings for 2021, 2020, and 2019, including its line item in the financial statements, is as follows:\nOther Derivatives Not Designated as Hedging Instruments\nTo hedge the economic risk of changes in value of the 2020 cash tender offers prior to the pricing date, the Company entered into reverse treasury lock derivative contracts with a combined notional amount of $\n2.0\nbillion.  Upon the pricing of the 2020 cash tender offers, the Company settled the reverse treasury lock derivative contracts and made a payment to its counterparty for $\n26\nmillion, which is included in loss on extinguishment of debt in the consolidated statements of earnings for the year ended January 29, 2021.  The cash flows related to these contracts are included within financing activities in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows.\nNOTE 10:\nShareholders’ (Deficit)/Equity\nAuthorized shares of preferred stock were\n5.0\nmillion ($\n5\npar value) at January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021,\nnone\nof which have been issued.  The Board of Directors may issue the preferred stock (without action by shareholders) in one or more series, having such voting rights, dividend and liquidation preferences, and such conversion and other rights as may be designated by the Board of Directors at the time of issuance.\nAuthorized shares of common stock were\n5.6\nbillion ($\n0.50\npar value) at January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.\nThe Company has a share repurchase program that is executed through purchases made from time to time either in the open market or through private off-market transactions.  Shares purchased under the repurchase program are returned to authorized and unissued status.  On December 15, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors authorized a $\n13.0\nbillion share repurchase under the program, in addition to the $\n15.0\nbillion of share repurchases authorized by the Board of Directors in December 2020, with no expiration.  As of January 28, 2022, the Company had $\n19.7\nbillion remaining under the program.\nDuring the year ended January 28, 2022, the Company entered into Accelerated Share Repurchase (ASR) agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase a total of\n41.6\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock for $\n8.7\nbillion.  At inception, the Company paid the financial institutions using cash on hand and took initial delivery of shares.  Under the terms of the ASR agreements, upon settlement, the Company would either receive additional shares from the financial institution or be required to deliver additional shares or cash to the financial institution.  The Company controlled its election to either deliver additional shares or cash to the financial institution and was subject to provisions which limited the number of shares the Company would be required to deliver.\nThe final number of shares received upon settlement of each ASR agreement was determined with reference to the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock over the term of the ASR agreement.  The initial repurchase of shares under these agreements resulted in an immediate reduction of the outstanding shares used to calculate the weighted-average common shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share.\nThese ASR agreements were accounted for as treasury stock transactions and forward stock purchase contracts.  The par value of the shares received was recorded as a reduction to common stock with the remainder recorded as a reduction to capital in excess of par value and (accumulated deficit)/retained earnings.  The forward stock purchase contracts were considered indexed to the Company’s own stock and were classified as equity instruments.\nThe terms of each ASR agreement entered into during the last three fiscal years, structured as outlined above, are as follows (in millions):\n1\nThe Company entered into variable notional ASR agreements with third-party financial institutions to repurchase between a minimum notional amount and a maximum notional amount.  At inception of each transaction, the Company paid the maximum notional amount and received shares.  When the Company finalized each transaction, it received additional shares as well as a cash payment from the third-party financial institution equal to the difference between the prepayment amount (maximum notional amount) and the final notional amount.\nDuring the year ended January 28, 2022, the Company also repurchased shares of its common stock through the open market totaling\n21.0\nmillion shares for a cost of $\n4.3\nbillion.\nThe Company also withholds shares from employees to satisfy either the exercise price of stock options exercised or the statutory withholding tax liability resulting from the vesting of restricted stock awards and performance share units.\nTotal shares repurchased for 2021, 2020, and 2019 were as follows:\n1\nReductions of $\n12.6\nbillion, $\n4.7\nbillion, and $\n4.1\nbillion were recorded to (accumulated deficit)/retained earnings, after capital in excess of par value was depleted, for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nNOTE 11:\nShare-Based Payments\nOverview of Share-Based Payment Plans\nThe Company has a number of active equity incentive plans (the Incentive Plans) under which the Company has been authorized to grant share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors.  The Company also has an employee stock purchase plan (the ESPP) that allows employees to purchase Company shares at a discount through payroll deductions.  All of these plans contain a non-discretionary anti-dilution provision that is designed to equalize the value of an award as a result of any stock dividend, stock split, recapitalization, or any other similar equity restructuring.\nA total of\n80.0\nmillion shares were authorized for grants of share-based awards to key employees and non-employee directors under the Company’s currently active Incentive Plans, of which there were\n27.0\nmillion shares remaining available for grants as of January 28, 2022.\nOn May 29, 2020, shareholders approved the Lowe’s Companies, Inc. 2020 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the 2020 ESPP), which permits a maximum number of shares offered under the new plan of\n20.0\nmillion shares.  The first offering date under\nthe 2020 ESPP began December 1, 2020, following the expiration of the Lowe’s Companies Employee Stock Purchase Plan – Stock Options for Everyone (the Former ESPP).  From its adoption to expiration on November 30, 2020, there were\n50.5\nmillion of the\n70.0\nmillion authorized shares issued under the Former ESPP.  The first offering period under the 2020 ESPP ended May 31, 2021, with the automatic exercise of options occurring the same day.  As of January 28, 2022, there were\n19.4\nmillion s\nhares remaining available for purchases.\nThe Company recognized share-based payment expense within SG&A expense in the consolidated statements of earnings of $\n230\nmillion, $\n155\nmillion, and $\n98\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  The total associated income tax benefit recognized, exclusive of excess tax benefits, was $\n40\nmillion, $\n29\nmillion, and $\n15\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nTotal unrecognized share-based payment expense for all share-based payment plans was $\n299\nmillion at January 28, 2022, of which $\n186\nmillion will be recognized in 2022, $\n97\nmillion in 2023, and $\n16\nmillion thereafter.  This results in these amounts being recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.5\nyears.\nFor all share-based payment awards, the expense recognized has been adjusted for estimated forfeitures where the requisite service is not expected to be met.  Estimated forfeiture rates are developed based on the Company’s analysis of historical forfeiture data for homogeneous employee groups.\nGeneral terms and methods of valuation for the Company’s share-based awards are as follows:\nStock Options\nStock options have terms of\n10\nyears, with one-third of each grant vesting each year for\nthree years\n, subsequent to the date of the grant, and are assigned an exercise price equal to the closing market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  Options are expensed on a straight-line basis over the grant vesting period, which is considered to be the requisite service period.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.  When determining expected volatility, the Company considers the historical volatility of the Company’s stock price, as well as implied volatility.  The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant, based on the options’ expected term.  The expected term of the options is based on the Company’s evaluation of option holders’ exercise patterns and represents the period of time that options are expected to remain unexercised.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes option-pricing model and weighted-average grant date fair value for options granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised, representing the difference between the exercise price and the market price on the date of exercise, was approximately $\n46\nmillion, $\n60\nmillion, and $\n44\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nTransactions related to stock options for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022 are summarized as follows:\n1\nIncludes outstanding vested options as well as outstanding nonvested options after a forfeiture rate is applied.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nRestricted stock awards are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  In general, these awards vest\n50\n% at the end of a\ntwo-year\nperiod from the date of grant and\n50\n% at the end of a\nthree-year\nperiod from the date of grant.  Certain awards vest\n100\n% at the end of a\nthree-year\nperiod from the date of grant.  All awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over a\nthree-year\nperiod, which is considered to be the requisite service period.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of restricted stock awards granted was $\n192.26\n,\n$\n83.83\n, and\n$\n109.04\nin 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock awards vesting each year was approximately $\n200\nmillion, $\n31\nmillion, and $\n64\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nTransactions related to restricted stock awards for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022 are summarized as follows:\nDeferred Stock Units\nDeferred stock units are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.  For non-employee Directors, these awards vest immediately and are expensed on the grant date.  During 2021, 2020, and 2019, each non-employee Director was awarded a number of deferred stock units determined by dividing the annual award amount by the fair market value of a share of the Company’s common stock on the award date and rounding up to the next 100 units.  The annual award amount used to determine the number of deferred stock units granted to each Director was $\n175,000\nfor 2021, 2020, and 2019.  During 2021,\n9,800\ndeferred stock units were granted and immediately vested for non-employee Directors.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of deferred stock units granted was $\n194.83\n, $\n130.35\n, and $\n93.28\nin 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  The total fair value of deferred stock units vested was $\n2\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion, and $\n2\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  At January 28, 2022, there were\n107,000\ndeferred stock units outstanding, all of which are vested.\nPerformance Share Units\nThe Company issues performance share units classified as equity awards.  Expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, based on the probability of achieving the performance condition, with changes in expectations\nrecognized as an adjustment to earnings in the period of the change.  Compensation cost is not recognized for performance share units that do not vest because service or performance conditions are not satisfied, and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed.  Performance share units do not have dividend rights.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the timing and amount of forfeitures.\nThe Company’s performance share units are classified as equity and contain performance and service conditions that must be satisfied for an employee to earn the right to benefit from the award.  The performance share units contain a market condition modifier, in addition to having a performance and service condition.  The performance condition for these awards continues to be based primarily on the achievement of the Company’s return on invested capital (ROIC) targets.  The market condition is based on the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the median TSR of companies listed in the S&P 500 Index over a three-year performance period.  The Company uses a Monte-Carlo simulation to determine the grant date fair value for these awards, which takes into consideration the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected during the requisite service period, as well as the possible outcomes pertaining to the TSR market condition.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo simulations for these awards granted in 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:\nIn general,\n0\n% to\n200\n% of the Company’s performance share units vest at the end of a\nthree-year\nservice period from the date of grant based upon achievement of the performance condition, or a combination of the performance and market conditions, specified in the performance share unit agreement.\nThe weighted-average grant-date fair value per unit of performance share units classified as equity awards granted was $\n208.74\n, $\n203.85\n, and $\n115.93\nin 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  There were\nno\nperformance share units vesting in 2021 or 2020.  The total fair value of performance share units vesting was approximately $\n19\nmillion in 2019.\nTransactions related to performance share units classified as equity awards for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022 are summarized as follows:\n¹\nThe number of units presented is based on achieving the targeted performance goals as defined in the performance share unit agreements.  As of January 28, 2022, the maximum number of nonvested units that could vest under the provisions of the agreements was\n1.3\nmillion.\nRestricted Stock Units\nRestricted stock units do not have dividend rights and are valued at the market price of a share of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant less the present value of dividends expected during the requisite service period.  In general, these awards vest\n50\n% at the end of a\ntwo-year\nperiod from the date of grant and\n50\n% at the end of a\nthree-year\nperiod from the date of grant.  Certain awards vest\n100\n% at the end of a\nthree-year\nperiod from the date of grant.  All awards are expensed on a straight-line basis over that period, which is considered to be the requisite service period.  The Company uses historical data to estimate the\ntiming and amount of forfeitures.  The weighted-average grant-date fair value per share of restricted stock units granted was $\n184.40\n, $\n75.59\n, and $\n103.40\nin 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.  The total fair value of restricted stock units vesting was approximately $\n47\nmillion, $\n5\nmillion, and $\n9\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nTransactions related to restricted stock units for the fiscal year ended January 28, 2022 are summarized as follows:\nESPP\nThe purchase price of the shares under both the 2020 ESPP and the Former ESPP equals\n85\n% of the closing price on the date of purchase.  The Company’s share-based payment expense per share is equal to\n15\n% of the closing price on the date of purchase.  The ESPP is considered a liability award and is measured at fair value at each reporting date, and the share-based payment expense is recognized over the six-month offering period.  Under the 2020 ESPP, the Company issued\n0.6\nmillion shares of common stock in 2021 and recognized $\n20\nmillion of share-based payment expense.  Under the Former ESPP, the Company issued\n0.7\nmillion and\n0.8\nmillion shares of common stock in 2020 and 2019, respectively, and recognized $\n16\nmillion and $\n13\nmillion of share-based payment expense pursuant to the Former ESPP in 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNOTE 12:\nEmployee Retirement Plans\nThe Company maintains a defined contribution retirement plan for eligible employees (the 401(k) Plan).  Eligible employees may participate in the 401(k) Plan the first of the month after\nthirty days\nof employment.  The Company makes contributions to the 401(k) Plan each payroll period, based upon a matching formula applied to employee deferrals (the Company Match).  Participants are eligible to receive the Company Match pursuant to the terms of the 401(k) Plan.  The Company Match varies based on how much the employee elects to defer up to a maximum of\n4.25\n% of eligible compensation.  The Company Match is invested identically to employee contributions and is immediately vested.\nThe Company maintains a Benefit Restoration Plan to supplement benefits provided under the 401(k) Plan to participants whose benefits are restricted as a result of certain provisions of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.  This plan provides for employee salary deferrals and employer contributions in the form of a Company Match.\nThe Company maintains a non-qualified deferred compensation program called the Lowe’s Cash Deferral Plan.  This plan is designed to permit certain employees to defer receipt of portions of their compensation, thereby delaying taxation on the deferral amount and on subsequent earnings until the balance is distributed.  This plan does not provide for Company contributions.\nThe Company recognized expense associated with these employee retirement plans of $\n177\nmillion, $\n175\nmillion, and $\n175\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nNOTE 13:\nIncome Taxes\nThe following is a reconciliation of the federal statutory tax rate to the effective tax rate:\nThe components of the income tax provision are as follows:\n1\nAmounts applicable to foreign income taxes were insignificant for all periods presented.\nThe tax effects of cumulative temporary differences that gave rise to the deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows:\nAs of January 28, 2022, the Company reported a deferred tax asset of $\n225\nmillion, for the capital loss realized in 2017 for U.S. federal income tax purposes related to the exit from the Company’s joint venture investment in Australia.  Since no present or future capital gains have been identified through which the asset can be realized, the Company has a full valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset.  For U.S. federal tax purposes, this loss has a five-year carryforward period expiring at the end of fiscal 2022.\nThe Company operates Lowe’s Companies Canada, ULC as a branch and has cumulatively incurred Canadian net operating losses of $\n750\nmillion and $\n769\nmillion as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.  The Company operates RONA inc. as a foreign corporation and has cumulatively incurred Canadian net operating losses of $\n189\nmillion and $\n261\nmillion as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.  These net operating losses are subject to expiration in 2024 through 2041.  Deferred tax assets have been established for these foreign net operating losses in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.  Given the uncertainty regarding the realization of the foreign net deferred tax assets, the Company recorded cumulative valuation allowances of $\n346\nmillion and $\n357\nmillion as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.  These valuation allowances are based on management’s assessment of the available positive and negative evidence to estimate the realization of this entity’s existing deferred tax assets.  A significant piece of objective negative evidence evaluated was the cumulative loss incurred over the three-year periods ended January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021, respectively.  The amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable, however, could be adjusted if objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present and if estimates of future taxable income are increased.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would favorably impact the effective tax rate were $\n38\nmillion as of January 28, 2022 and $\n2\nmillion as of January 29, 2021.\nThe net interest expense recognized by the Company related to uncertain tax positions was $\n12\nmillion for 2021, and insignificant for 2020 and 2019.  The Company had $\n11\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion of accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions as of January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.\nPenalties recognized related to uncertain tax positions were $\n4\nmillion for 2021 and insignificant for tax years 2020 and 2019.  The Company had $\n4\nmillion of accrued penalties related to uncertain tax positions as of January 28, 2022, and\nno\naccrued penalties as of January 29, 2021.\nThe Company is subject to examination by various foreign and domestic taxing authorities.  There are ongoing U.S. state audits covering tax years 2015 to 2020.  An audit of the Company’s Canadian operations by the Canada Revenue Agency for fiscal years 2015 and 2016 is on-going.  The Company remains subject to income tax examinations for fiscal years 2015 through 2020.  The Company believes appropriate provisions for all outstanding issues have been made for all jurisdictions and all open years.\nNote 14:\nEarnings Per Share\nThe Company calculates basic and diluted earnings per common share using the two-class method.  Under the two-class method, net earnings are allocated to each class of common stock and participating security as if all of the net earnings for the period had been distributed.  The Company’s participating securities consist of share-based payment awards that contain a nonforfeitable right to receive dividends and, therefore, are considered to participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders.\nBasic earnings per common share excludes dilution and is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period.  Diluted earnings per common share is calculated by dividing net earnings allocable to common shares by the weighted-average number of common shares as of the balance sheet\ndate, as adjusted for the potential dilutive effect of non-participating share-based awards.\nThe following table reconciles earnings per common share for 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nNOTE 15:\nCommitments and Contingencies\nThe Company is, from time to time, party to various legal proceedings considered to be in the normal course of business, none of which, individually or in the aggregate, are expected to be material to the Company’s financial statements.  In evaluating liabilities associated with its various legal proceedings, the Company has accrued for probable liabilities associated with these matters.  The amounts accrued were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in any of the years presented.  Reasonably possible losses for any of the individual legal proceedings which have not been accrued were not material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAs of January 28, 2022, the Company had non-cancellable commitments of $\n1.6\nbillion related to certain marketing and information technology programs, and purchases of merchandise inventory.  These commitments include agreements to purchase goods or services that are enforceable, are legally binding, and specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed, minimum or variable price provisions; and the approximate timing of the transaction.  Payments under these commitments are scheduled to be made as follows: 2022, $\n1.1\nbillion; 2023, $\n402\nmillion; 2024, $\n78\nmillion; 2025, $\n68\nmillion; 2026, $\n9\nmillion.\nAt January 28, 2022, the Company held standby and documentary letters of credit issued under banking arrangements which totaled $\n462\nmillion.  The majority of the Company’s letters of credit were issued to support the Company’s warranty program.\nNOTE 16:\nRelated Parties\nA former member of the Company’s Board of Directors also serves on the Board of Directors of a vendor that provides branded consumer packaged goods to the Company.  The Company purchased products from this vendor in the amount of $\n203\nmillion in 2021, $\n214\nmillion in 2020, and $\n165\nmillion in 2019.  Amounts payable to this vendor were insignificant to the Company at January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.  This was no longer considered a related party relationship as of January 28, 2022.\nThe Company’s President and Chief Executive Officer also serves on the Board of Directors of a vendor that provides transportation and business services to the Company.  The Company purchased services from this vendor in the amount of $\n269\nmillion in 2021, $\n138\nmillion in 2020, and $\n117\nmillion in 2019.  Amounts payable to this vendor were insignificant to the Company at January 28, 2022 and January 29, 2021.\nNOTE 17:\nOther Information\nNet interest expense is comprised of the following:\nSupplemental disclosures of cash flow information:\n1\nSee\nfor supplemental cash flow disclosures related to finance and operating leases.\nSales by product category:\nNote: Product category sales for prior periods have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nSUPPLEMENTARY DATA\nSelected Quarterly Data (UNAUDITED)\nThe following table summarizes the quarterly consolidated results of operations for 2021 and 2020:"
