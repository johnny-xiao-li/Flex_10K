    "text": "The following description of the business should be read in conjunction with the information included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2021. This description contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements due to the factors set forth in “Risk Factors” and elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOverview\nCboe Global Markets, Inc., a leading provider of market infrastructure and tradable products, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to market participants around the world. The Company is committed to operating a trusted, inclusive global marketplace, and to providing leading products, technology and data solutions that enable participants to define a sustainable financial future. Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest stock exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates one of the largest stock exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns EuroCCP, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Trading, a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., MATCHNow, a leading equities ATS in Canada, Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, and Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan. Cboe also is a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading.\nThe graphic below provides a brief overview of Cboe’s history:\n​\n8\nOur Business\nCboe Global Markets reports on the following five business segments:\nSee “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” and Note 16 (“Segment Reporting”) in the notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements for discussion of revenues and certain operational and financial metrics, and operating income (or loss) by business segment. Certain activities within our segments operate globally. For information regarding risks related to our international operations see “Risk Factors.”\n​\n9\nCompetitive Strengths\nCboe is a leading provider of market infrastructure and tradable products across cash and spot markets, derivative markets and data and access solutions. Cboe delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions across the globe through a comprehensive ecosystem that helps drive innovation and growth.\nKey Growth Strategy Initiatives\nOur strategy is to build one of the world’s largest global derivatives and securities networks to create value and drive growth by:\n​\n10\nProprietary Products\nIn addition to providing cash and spot markets, derivative markets, and data and access solutions, we also offer for trading proprietary products and are a leader in the volatility space with our proprietary products. These proprietary products are built both through our in-house research and development staff of the Data and Access Solutions business and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. Our most frequently traded proprietary products include SPX options and VIX options and futures.\nSPX Options\nThe S&P 500 Index is an index comprised of 500 large-cap U.S. listed companies. It is one of the most commonly followed indices and is considered a bellwether for the U.S. economy. The SPX options we offer on the S&P 500 Index are exclusive to Cboe and contribute substantially to our volumes and transaction fees. Because of the S&P 500 Index’s status as a bellwether, SPX options are used in many different trading strategies by customers with different goals, including pension funds hedging their equity exposure by buying put options, asset managers seeking enhanced returns by selling covered call options and hedge funds using risk-managed strategies to capture so-called “risk premia” embedded in option prices. We also offer SPX Weeklys options, which have settlements on Mondays, Wednesdays, Fridays and on the last trading day of each month and nearly 24x5 trading in SPX options. We believe these additional expirations provide customers with more precision when hedging overall portfolio risk.\nVolatility Trading\nCboe pioneered the trading of exchange-traded volatility products with its introduction of VIX futures in 2004 and VIX options in 2006. The VIX Index (as defined below), although not directly tradable, is based on the mid-point of real-time quotes of SPX options and is designed to reflect investors’ consensus view of future 30-day expected stock market volatility. The VIX methodology provides the basis for the creation of VIX options and futures. The final settlement value of VIX derivatives is determined on their expiration date through a Special Opening Quotation (“SOQ”) of the VIX Index. The SOQ calculation uses opening trade prices of selected options; unless there is no opening price, in which case the opening price used in the SOQ calculation is the midpoint of the highest bid and lowest offer at the time of the opening. Since we started offering these products, we have seen trading from a number of different customer segments utilizing a number of different trading strategies, including hedging extreme stock market declines, also known as “tail risk” hedging, and risk-managed strategies that seek to capture the relative price changes of expected volatility at different times in the future. We also offer VIX Weeklys options and futures, mini VIX futures, and nearly 24x5 trading in VIX options and futures to provide investors with additional tools to trade volatility.\nProprietary Indices\nWe also calculate and disseminate proprietary indices that are licensed for use by third parties or are used as the basis for other proprietary products. These proprietary indices are built both through our in-house research and development staff of the Data and Access Solutions business and our strategic relationships and license agreements with index providers, which are both described below in further detail. Our proprietary indices include:\nIn addition to any transaction fee revenue generated on products created based on these indices, we have granted licenses for third parties to use and sublicense some of these proprietary indices to create third-party indices and products. Accordingly, we generate revenue from proprietary indices by distributing them for reference purposes, using them as the basis for proprietary products and licensing them for use for third-party indices and products.\n11\nStrategic Relationships\nThe Company has long-term business relationships with several providers of market indices. We license their indices, including on an exclusive basis, as the foundation for indices, index options and other products. The Company also acquires interests in and agrees to work jointly with key providers to develop new products and services that are expected to capitalize on our core competencies and diversify our sources of revenue. Of particular note are the following:\nData and Access Solutions\nThe Data and Access Solutions business provides an offering of market data and information solutions products across multiple asset classes and geographic regions that are designed to suit our customers’ diverse needs. The Data and Access Solutions business consists of five product groups:\n12\nIn 2021, we started to provide data services to market participants globally through Cboe Global Cloud with a plan to disseminate most of Cboe’s real-time market data and analytics products via the cloud as an additional distribution channel.\nU.S. Tape Plans\nWe also derive a portion of our revenue from market data fees from U.S. tape plans, including Unlisted Trading Privileges (“UTPs”), the Consolidated Tape Association (“CTA”) and OPRA. Fees, net of plan costs, from UTP, CTA, and OPRA are allocated and distributed to plan participants like us according to their share of tape fees based on a formula, required by Regulation NMS, which may take into account both trading and quoting activity.\nOur Market Models\nWe operate a variety of derivatives and cash and spot markets. Our markets use a combination of pricing and market models to differentiate them from each other and from our competitors.\nFor our U.S. derivatives options markets, Cboe Options is a hybrid market combining open outcry floor trading with electronic trading. For multi-listed products, we utilize public customer priority, market turner in certain products, participation rights and pro-rata allocation market models, combined with the “classic” pricing model. Under the classic pricing model, professional participants pay transaction fees, public customers generally do not pay transaction fees and market makers compensate brokers for sending order flow to the exchange (known as payment for order flow). For proprietary products, we use price-time or pro-rata allocation, sometimes with public customer priority, and market turner market models, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees. Our other three options markets are fully electronic. BZX options utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a “maker-taker” pricing model. Under the maker-taker pricing model, market participants who make the market (a “maker”) generally receive a rebate, while market participants who trade against those markets (a “taker”) pay a transaction fee. EDGX options utilizes customer priority, participation rights and pro-rata allocation market models, combined with the classic pricing model. C2 options utilizes a pro-rata allocation market model, combined with the maker-taker pricing model.\nFor our U.S. derivatives futures market, which is fully electronic, CFE utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a pricing model where all market participants generally pay fees, subject to specified exceptions.\nFor our cash and spot markets, the U.S. equities exchanges, which are fully electronic, offer various market models. BZX equities utilizes a price-time market model, combined with the maker-taker pricing model. EDGX equities utilizes a price-time with retail priority market model, combined with the maker-taker pricing model. BYX equities utilizes a price-time with price improvement for retail customers market model, combined with the “taker-maker” pricing model. Under the taker-maker pricing model, market participants who make the market pay a transaction fee, while market participants who trade against those markets receive a rebate. EDGA equities utilizes a price-time market model, combined with a taker-maker pricing model. In addition to these market models, each of the U.S. equity exchanges provides numerous specific order types that are designed to enhance their respective market models.\nFor our cash and spot markets, MATCHNow, the Canadian equities ATS, which is fully electronic, utilizes a model that combines frequent call matches and continuous execution opportunities in a confidential trading book. The system uses real-time quotes for protected transparent Canadian markets, and orders may be firm or conditional. Firm orders matched within MATCHNow are executed at three levels of price improvement: (1) the mid-point between the Canadian best bid and offer (the “CBBO”); (2) one price increment better than the CBBO or; (3) at the bid or offer for orders that meet a specified large threshold. Trading fees are typically calculated as a function of trade volume and share price.\nIn Europe, following the implementation of the Directive on Markets in Financial Instruments (Directive 2014/65/EU) (“MiFID II”), for the derivatives and cash and spot markets, rebates are generally available if they are tied to a market making scheme or specific service.\nFor our cash and spot markets, BIDS Trading, the U.S. equities ATS market, which is fully electronic, utilizes a sponsored access model to provide anonymous executions in NMS stocks. BIDS Trading provides numerous order types, including both firm and conditional orders. All orders matched within BIDS Trading are executed at or better than the\n13\nNBBO. BIDS Trading charges fees based on disclosed, objective criteria: (i) means of access; (ii) the type of order; and (iii) the total volume of executions during the calendar month.\nIn Australia, for our derivatives and cash and spot markets, Cboe Australia, a regulated stock exchange, which is fully electronic, utilizes a model\nthat charges a different ad valorem fee rate depending on whether a participant is making or taking liquidity. Fee waivers are also provided to participants registered as market makers, but payments for order flow are prohibited.\nIn Japan, for our cash and spot markets, Cboe Japan, offers two fully electronic displayed markets, Chi-Alpha, which utilizes a price-time market model, combined with the “maker-taker” pricing model and Chi-Select, which utilizes a price-time retail customers focused market model, combined with the “taker-maker” pricing model. Cboe Japan also offers two fully electronic non-displayed markets, Chi-Match, which matches VWAP orders during pre-market hours and Kai-X, which utilizes a price-time market model aiming for primary market mid-point trades.\nFor our FX spot markets, the Cboe FX platform utilizes a price-firmness-time priority market model, combined with a pricing model where users are charged either a flat or tiered commission rate based upon the notional amount traded on the platform. For our FX NDF markets, Cboe SEF and Cboe Swiss platforms utilize a price-firmness-time priority market model and charge a flat commission based upon the notional amount traded on the platform and the capacity in which a participant is trading.\nOur markets also charge fees for the opportunity to trade or access our markets, including fees for trading-related functionality. To facilitate trading, we also charge fees for certain technology services, terminal and other equipment rights, maintenance services, trading floor space and telecommunications services.\nListing\nCboe serves as a listing destination for ETPs in the U.S., the UK, Europe and Australia, and its markets are structured and designed for ETP issuers and their investors. In 2021, Cboe added 121 ETP listings in the U.S. and won 25% of all new U.S. ETP listings. There are now 643 ETPs globally listed on Cboe from 84 different issuers. We offer fully-\nautomated opening, closing and halt reopening auctions for our listed securities, which are designed to maximize the efficiency of the price discovery process.\nClearing\nOur subsidiary EuroCCP, a European central counterparty (“CCP”), provides post-trade services, including clearing, to stock exchanges, multilateral trading facilities and for over-the-counter equities trades and derivatives trades. EuroCCP acts as a central counterparty that, for its clearing participants, becomes the buyer to every seller and the seller to every buyer. As a result, it guarantees the timely performance of the obligations of buyers and sellers and takes on the risk of the performance of the transactions that it clears. Additionally, as a critical Financial Market Infrastructure, EuroCCP is subject to strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight. In 2021, EuroCCP provided CCP protection for an average of\n€\n43 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2021, EuroCCP eliminated 72%, or\n€\n31 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of\n€\n12 billion. In 2020, EuroCCP provided CCP protection for an average of\n€\n41 billion of cleared value on a daily basis. Through the process of netting, in 2020, EuroCCP eliminated 80%, or\n€\n30 billion of the average daily cleared value, leaving an average daily settlement value of\n€\n11 billion.\nCustomers\nOur customers generally include financial institutions, trading platforms, institutional and individual investors, and professional traders. Our equities and options customers in the United States include trading permit holders and members of Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers, and the customers of those broker-dealers. Our Canadian equities customers include subscribers of MATCHNow, which are Canadian registered investment dealers, and certain clients of those dealers. Our Australian customers include trading participants of Cboe Australia, which are Australian registered investment dealers, and certain clients of those dealers. Our Japanese customers include participants of Chi-Alpha, Chi-Select, Chi-Match and Kai-X, which are Japanese registered broker-dealers, and certain clients of those dealers. Our ATS equities participants in the United States include subscribers of BIDS Trading, which are SEC-registered broker-dealers, and certain customers of those broker-dealers. Our futures customers include banks, futures commission merchants and their customers, hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms, and Commodity Trading Advisors. Similarly, our equities’ customers in Europe are European Union (“EU”)\n14\nregulated brokerage and proprietary trading firms, as well as sponsored access clients of these brokerage firms and certain non-EU regulated and unregulated direct access participants. EuroCCP clears equities, equity like instruments from 18 European markets and from the United States. EuroCCP also clears equity derivative instruments as traded on Cboe NL. EuroCCP clearing participants include EEA regulated banks and brokerage trading firms. Our institutional global FX customers include banks, broker-dealers, hedge funds, asset managers, proprietary trading firms, Commodity Trading Advisors, and corporates. Access to our markets and trading rights and privileges depend upon the nature of the customer, such as whether the individual or firm is (or is eligible to become) a trading permit holder, trading privilege holder, member, participant, or subscriber of one of our markets.\nCompetition\nThe industry in which we operate is intensely competitive. We believe we face competition on a number of factors, including:\nWe believe that we compete favorably with respect to these factors through a variety of methods, including:\nIn our proprietary products, we compete against other futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products, as well as against financial market participants that offer similar over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as options on SPY, which may offer similar market exposure of our proprietary products, such as SPX options.\nThe multi-listed options industry is extremely competitive. We expect this trend to continue. As of December 31, 2021, we compete with 12 U.S. options exchanges, in large part due to existing exchange holding companies opening new exchanges that offer different markets and pricing models on existing technology. Most of the equity and ETP options listed and traded on our exchanges are also listed and traded on the other exchanges. In addition, the options exchanges that we compete with set fees and rebates to attract multi-listed options business to their exchanges, which has historically reduced the net revenue per contract that we generate from multi-listed options, and the options exchanges that we compete with structure their options businesses in partnership with established market participants, such as consolidators, and other order flow providers, to increase their volume traded.\nOur U.S. listed equity securities and listing services and the BIDS Trading ATS compete against 12 other exchanges as of December 31, 2021, and several other ATSs and single dealer platforms. Market participants have multiple venues for the execution of orders, including national securities exchanges and numerous off-exchange venues, including other ATSs and broker-dealers who internalize orders off-exchange. Additionally, issuers have multiple venues for the listing of their products. In Canada, our equities ATS, MATCHNow, competes with several Canadian exchanges and other ATSs. In Australia, our exchange, Cboe Australia, competes with other Australian exchanges and ATSs. In Japan, our equities exchanges and ATSs, compete with several Japanese exchanges and other ATSs.\n15\nThe market for execution and clearing services in Europe became more competitive following the introduction of MiFID II and the Regulation on Markets in Financial Instruments (Regulation (EU) No 600/2014) (“MiFIR”). Furthermore, MiFID II and MiFIR placed more onerous conditions on trading venues and investment firms and restricted certain types of trading activity. Our major competitors in Europe include national stock exchanges, other pan-European MTFs, European clearinghouses, dark pools, and systematic internalizers.\nThe global FX market remains severely fragmented, with transparent automated marketplaces such as Cboe FX challenging a small number of similarly situated competitors. While the global FX market has experienced a shift from competing interbank platforms to ECNs, the electronification of the spot and NDF FX market may encounter resistance from customers that still prefer to utilize the phone, instant chats, terminals and key banking relationships for price discovery and trading. Furthermore, electronification of the FX market appears to be experiencing more resistance outside the United States. The electronic spot FX market is also intensely competitive, with over 10 other venues competing for market share as of December 31, 2021. Cboe measures and reports on market share against a narrower set of competitors, included in those venues.\nIn addition, our data and access solutions face competition from other securities exchanges, technology companies, third-party market data providers, and information and software vendors, which have their own substantial market data distribution capabilities that serve as alternative means for receiving open market data feeds instead of connecting directly to our exchanges or trading venues. The sale of our proprietary data products is also under competitive threat from ATSs and trading venues that offer similar products. Distributors and consumers of our market data may also use our market data as an input into a product that competes against one of our traded or cleared products.\nTechnology\nCboe Trading Technology\nThe trading platform for our equities, options, and futures markets is developed, owned, and operated in-house and is designed to optimize reliability, speed, scalability, and versatility. Each of our exchanges provide different market models, appealing to different user bases, and the trading technologies support all of them. Further, the technologies are designed to support many specialized features for each of the markets, such as: dark pools, trade reporting facility, systematic internalizer, Large-in-Scale, smart order routing, FLEX options, 24x5 trading, and hybrid trading (combining electronic and open outcry). In addition, Cboe and its applicable subsidiaries operate separate trading and/or clearing platforms, as applicable, for BIDS Trading, MATCHNow, EuroCCP, Global FX, Cboe Australia, and Cboe Japan.\nOur trading platforms have experienced very low operational downtime and low latency. The trading platforms use readily available hardware, thereby minimizing capital outlays required for each new market entry. Also, in order to continue to implement new enhancements to our trading platforms, new releases of software are generally deployed routinely in all of the applicable markets.\nDisaster Recovery\nWe operate and maintain geographically diverse disaster recovery facilities for all of our markets. We expect that the disaster recovery facilities can be up and running in a short period of time and in certain instances we work with our market participants to try to quickly reopen marketplaces. We regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests using our back-up data centers, as well as an annual test with our U.S. trading participants. In Canada, as required by local regulations, MATCHNow conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually, and it participates in the bi-annual testing coordinated by IIROC. In Australia and Japan, Chi-X Asia Pacific conducts internal testing of its disaster recovery data processing capabilities at least annually. In Europe, we also regularly test our data center recovery plans and periodically carry out weekend tests which use our back-up data center, as well as an annual test with our European trading participants. We continue to work to improve both the availability of our technology and our disaster recovery facilities.\nRouting and Clearing\nOCC is the sole provider of clearing on all of our U.S. options and futures exchanges. National Securities Clearing Corporation (“NSCC”), a subsidiary of the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation (“DTC”), is the sole provider of clearing on our U.S. listed equity exchanges. The Canadian Depository for Securities (“CDS”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on MATCHNow. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, Cboe Australia delivers matched trades of its customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia. The Japan Securities Clearing Corporation\n16\n(“JSCC”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on Cboe Japan’s Chi-Alpha, Chi-Select,\nChi-Match and Kai-X. BofA Securities, Inc. (“BOA”) is the sole provider of clearing on all equities transactions occurring on BIDS Trading. Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives relies on LCH Limited and LCH SA (“LCH”), EuroCCP, which is described above, and SIX x-clear Ltd (“SIX x-clear”) to clear trades in European listed equity securities and derivatives as part of an interoperable clearing model.\nCboe Trading is a routing broker-dealer used by our four U.S. equities exchanges and our four U.S. options exchanges, including the electronic platform portion of Cboe Options. Cboe Trading’s clearings firms are Wedbush Securities, Inc. (“Wedbush”) and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC (“Morgan Stanley”)\n.\nRegulatory Environment and Compliance\nVarious aspects of our business are subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, IIROC, the Ontario Securities Commission (the “OSC”), the Australian Securities & Investments Commission (“ASIC”), JFSA, JSDA, ESMA, FCA, the Central Bank of the Netherlands (“DNB”), AFM, and other international regulatory authorities where our exchanges or EuroCCP may be authorized to act as foreign exchanges or provide clearing services, and market participants may be subject to regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FINRA, National Futures Association (“NFA”), FCA, Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve, U.S. Department of the Treasury and/or foreign regulators. The following is a discussion of the more significant areas of regulation of us by the SEC, the CFTC, and certain European regulators.\nRecent Developments\nLaws and regulations regarding our business are frequently modified or changed to address perceived problems, new products, or competition or at the request of market participants. The following is a brief discussion of recent regulatory developments that may significantly impact our business.\nUnited States\nConsolidated Data Plan Order\nOn May 6, 2020, the SEC issued an order (the “Consolidated Data Plan Order”) that would require U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA to develop and file a new consolidated data plan (the “Plan”) that would replace the three current U.S. equities tape data plans and require certain governance provisions, such as changes to the voting structure. Pursuant to the Consolidated Data Plan Order, we and the other U.S. equities exchanges and FINRA were required to file the proposed Plan for public comment before the SEC takes any definitive action on such new plan. The proposed Plan was filed on August 11, 2020 and on August 6, 2021 the SEC approved such Plan. The Plan was subsequently challenged by exchanges and the courts granted a stay of the Plan. Until a decision is made by the courts, the current data plans will continue to govern. Our equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, may require additional resources to comply with or challenge the Consolidated Data Plan Order and the Plan may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there is a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan. See “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nFinancial Transaction Taxes\nA number of federal, state and local jurisdictions in the U.S. and EU Member States have considered a financial transaction tax, but many details remain to be discussed and agreed, including how to assess the tax.\nAdditionally, legislation has been proposed from time to time on a federal level that would introduce in the U.S. mark-to-market tax treatment for all derivatives contracts and require gains and losses be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. Implementation of such taxes could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our operations. See “Risk Factors” for more information\n.\nMarket Data Infrastructure Rule\nOn December 9, 2020, the SEC issued a Market Data Infrastructure Final Rule, which makes significant additions to the content available on the Securities Information Processors (“SIPs”) and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model. The implementation of the new rules could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a\n17\nmaterial impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. See “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nEurope\nCapital Markets Union\nThe European Council (“E.C.”) has highlighted one of its top priorities as being the establishment of a fully functioning, well-regulated Capital Markets Union (“CMU”). An Action Plan of concrete steps was set out in September 2015, and an update of the list of initiatives was published in September 2016. In November 2019, the E.C. set up a High Level Forum on CMU, resulting in a final report published in June 2020. On September 24, 2020, the E.C. published a new CMU Action Plan, and on November 25, 2021, published a set of legislative proposals in furtherance of the CMU, including proposals to amend the Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFIR”) described in the EU Transparency Rules section below. This therefore remains an ongoing project for the E.C., which may result in additional regulation or legislation. In November 2021 the EU Commission published an update regarding progress against the CMU Action Plan alongside a number of new legislative proposals designed to contribute to the objectives of CMU. These included proposals to:\nOTC Derivatives, Central Counterparties and Trade Repositories\nRegulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of July 4, 2012 on OTC derivatives, central counterparties and trade repositories (the “European Market Infrastructure Regulation\n” or “\nEMIR”) sets out rules relating to over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives markets, central counterparties and trade repositories. The rules introduce a reporting obligation for OTC derivatives markets, a clearing obligation for eligible OTC derivatives markets, measures to reduce counterparty credit and operational risk for bilateral OTC derivatives markets, CCPs, and trade repositories, and rules on the establishment of interoperability between CCPs. EMIR was enhanced and amended in June 2019. In addition, regulation governing the authorization and supervision of Central Securities Depositories (“CSDR”) was approved in September 2014, with the publication of most “Level 2” Regulatory Technical Standards in March 2017, with implementation in March 2019. CSDR may result in the introduction of mandatory buy-ins for OTC business in 2022 although recent communications from ESMA and the EU Commission have indicated that the intended implementation date of February 1, 2022 will be postponed pending a further review of those proposals by the EU Commission during 2022. Rules in relation to the calculation and collection of cash penalties are expected to come in to force in February 2022. The Central Counterparty Recovery and Resolution Regulation (“R&R Regulation”) was published in the Official Journal of the EU on January 22, 2021, which may, among other things, increase the amount of prefunded capital EuroCCP is required to maintain. This additional prefunded capital may be required to be drawn before any recovery measures can be taken by the CCP. On July 12, 2021, and November 18, 2021, ESMA proposed a set of level 2 and level 3 guidance pursuant to the R&R Regulation. As European authorities finalize and potentially adopt level 2 and 3 guidance, the final R&R Regulation may have a material adverse effect on our clearing business, financial condition and operating results.\nEU Transparency Rules\nOn November 11, 2021, the European Council (“E.C.”) published its proposal for a review of EU market structure legislation, including proposed amendments to Markets in Financial Instruments Regulation (“MiFiR”) and Directive 2014/65/EU on markets in financial instruments (“MiFID II”). The proposal includes, among other provisions, provision for\n18\na consolidated tape for the EU and changes to the transparency regime for equities. These proposals are expected to be implemented in late 2023 or early 2024.\nIn addition, the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) also published its proposal for a review of EU transparency rules. The proposal includes, among other provisions, provision for increased pre-trade transparency for periodic auctions and post-trade flagging. These proposals may be implemented in the second half of 2022 although they may also be incorporated into the wider MiFiR review.\nAs proposed, these proposals may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. See “Risk Factors” for more information.\nCompliance\nU.S. Securities Industry\nFederal securities laws have established a two-tiered system for the regulation of securities exchanges and market participants. The first tier consists of the SEC, which has primary responsibility for enforcing federal securities laws. The second tier consists of self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”), which are non-governmental entities that must register with and are regulated by the SEC. The Exchanges are SROs, each registered under Section 6 of the Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange Act”) as a “national securities exchange,” and are subject to oversight by the SEC.\nSROs are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. To be registered as a national securities exchange, an exchange must successfully undergo an application and review process with the SEC prior to beginning operations. Among other things, the SEC must determine that the SRO has the ability to comply with the Exchange Act and to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder and the rules of the exchange.\nIn general, an exchange SRO is responsible for operating its trading platforms consistent with its rules, and regulating its members through the adoption and enforcement of rules governing the business conduct of its members. The rules of the exchange must also assure fair representation of its members in the selection of its directors and administration of its affairs and, among other things, provide that one or more directors be representative of issuers or investors and not be associated with a member of the exchange or with a broker or dealer. Additionally, the rules of the exchange must be adequate to ensure fair dealing and to protect investors and may not impose any burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.\nAs registered national securities exchanges, virtually all facets of our Exchange operations are subject to the SEC’s oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder impose on us many regulatory and operational responsibilities, including record keeping and the day-to-day responsibilities for market operations and broker-dealer oversight. Furthermore, as SROs, the Exchanges are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC or other interested parties. The SEC also has broad enforcement powers to censure, fine, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit us from engaging in some of our businesses, suspend or revoke our designation as a registered securities exchange or remove or censure any of our officers or directors who violate applicable laws or regulations. For example, in 2013, Cboe Options and C2 and, in 2015, EDGX and EDGA, entered into consent orders with the SEC, under which they were censured, ordered to cease and desist from violating certain sections of the Exchange Act, paid fines and agreed to complete certain undertakings. We have certified to the completion of these undertakings and are no longer required to certify.\nAs part of its regulatory oversight, the SEC conducts periodic reviews and inspections of exchanges, and the Exchanges have been subject to such routine reviews and inspections. To the extent such reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business. We collect certain fees to cover Section 31 fees charged to the Exchanges by the SEC and certain fees derived from our regulatory function and fines in connection with our disciplinary proceedings. The Exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment of Section 31 fess to the SEC. Additionally, under the rules of each of our exchanges, as required by the SEC, any revenue derived from the regulatory fees and fines cannot be used for non-regulatory purposes.\nSection 19 of the Exchange Act also provides that we must submit to the SEC proposed changes to any of the Exchanges’ rules, including revisions of their certificates of incorporation, bylaws, or other governing documents of the\n19\nSROs or their parent companies. The SEC will typically publish the proposal for public comment, following which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. Certain categories of rule changes, like fee changes, can be effective on filing, but the SEC retains the ability to suspend or reject such filings within a prescribed period of time.\nCanadian Securities Industry\nMATCHNow is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by its primary provincial securities regulatory authority, the OSC, and by IIROC. The regulations applicable to MATCHNow cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nAustralian Securities Industry\nCboe Australia is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by the ASIC. The regulations applicable to Cboe Australia cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nJapanese Securities Industry\nCboe Japan is subject to comprehensive regulation and oversight by the JFSA and the JSDA. The regulations applicable to Cboe Japan cover a wide array of areas, including, but not limited to, marketplace operations (which include corporate governance, fair access, systems compliance and integrity, and conflict management requirements), trading rules, electronic trading risk management, and financial viability.\nFutures and Swaps Industry-CFE and Cboe SEF\nThe operations of each of CFE and Cboe SEF are subject to regulation by the CFTC under the Commodity Exchange Act. The Commodity Exchange Act generally requires that futures trading in the United States be conducted on a designated contract market and, in some cases, requires swaps trading to be conducted on swap execution facility (“SEF”) or designated contract market (“DCM”). The Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations establish criteria for an exchange to be designated as a contract market on which futures and futures options contracts may be traded, and for a trading platform to be designated as a swap execution facility on which certain swaps may be traded. Designation as a contract market or swap execution facility for the trading of specified futures or swaps contracts is non-exclusive. This means that the CFTC may permit additional exchanges or trading platforms to be contract markets or swap execution facilities for trading the same or similar contracts.\nCFE is a designated contract market, and Cboe SEF is a swap execution facility, each of which is subject to the oversight of the CFTC and to a variety of ongoing regulatory and reporting responsibilities under the Commodity Exchange Act. As a designated contract market, CFE is required to comply with the applicable core principles and regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act, as is Cboe SEF as a swap execution facility. Each of CFE and Cboe SEF has surveillance and regulatory operations and procedures to monitor and enforce compliance by trading privilege holders with CFE rules, and by participants with Cboe SEF rules, as applicable. If CFE or Cboe SEF fails to comply with applicable laws, rules or regulations, it may be subject to censure, fines, cease-and-desist orders, suspension of its business, removal of personnel or other sanctions, including revocation of CFE’s designation as a contract market or Cboe SEF’s designation as a swap execution facility.\nEurope\nCboe Europe is located in London and is subject to regulation in the UK and to certain European regulations. The current UK regulatory system was established by the Financial Services Act 2012 (“FSA12”), which amended the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. The legislation replaced the previous financial services regulator, the Financial Services Authority, with three new bodies: The Financial Policy Committee (“FPC”), The Prudential Regulation Authority, and the FCA. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the FCA, which is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the FSA12. The FCA has three statutory objectives: to secure an appropriate degree of protection for consumers; to protect and enhance the integrity of the UK financial system; and to promote effective competition in the interests of consumers in the markets for financial services. The FCA is accountable to Her Majesty’s Treasury Ministers and, through them, to Parliament.\n20\nEuroCCP and Cboe NL are located in Amsterdam and subject to Dutch law and regulation. The current Dutch regulatory system was established by the Act on Financial Supervision. Financial conduct of markets, including activity on, and the operation of, markets is regulated by the AFM. Financial conduct of CCPs, including clearing activity is regulated by the AFM and DNB. The AFM is an independent non-governmental body, given statutory powers by the Act on Financial Supervision. The AFM has three strategic objectives: to promote the fair and conscientious provision of financial services, to promote the fair and efficient operation of the capital markets and to contribute to the stability of the financial system. The AFM is accountable to the Minister of Finance. The DNB is the Dutch central bank, financial sector supervisor and resolution authority. The DNB is committed to a stable financial system: stable prices, solid financial institutions and properly functioning payment transfers.\nMuch of the UK and Dutch financial services regulation originates from the EU. Such regulation includes organizational requirements, capital resources requirements and the specific requirements for RMs and MTFs and are applicable to both Cboe Europe and Cboe NL. MiFID II and MiFIR set out requirements for RMs and MTFs with respect to the establishment of transparent and non-discretionary rules and procedures governing access and for fair and orderly trading and the efficient execution of orders, as well as to facilitate the efficient settlement of transactions conducted on RMs and MTFs and monitoring compliance with the rules. EMIR governs the CCPs operating in the EU and requires them to meet common risk management, governance and capital adequacy standards. The regulatory functions required of Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, including EuroCCP, by MiFID II, MiFIR, EMIR and other relevant legislation and regulations are performed by in-house staff. Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives utilizes the same state-of-the-art, real-time surveillance system is used on the U.S. to monitor trading and market activities on BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX. EuroCCP utilizes proprietary risk management software to monitor settlement and funding flows.\nGlobal FX\nWhile the global institutional spot FX market remains largely unregulated, the enactment of the Dodd Frank Act and its related regulations in the United States and the ongoing implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe have impacted the regulatory landscape for currency derivative products. For example, certain standardized currency derivative products are required to trade on an organized trading venue such as a SEF or DCM in the United States or on an MTF or organized trading facility in Europe. Moreover, even in the largely unregulated spot FX market, this movement towards additional trading standards and norms is highlighted by the publication of the FX Global Code in 2017 by the Global Foreign Exchange Committee, reflecting principles of good conduct for the wholesale FX market, and whose publication may lead to additional oversight in the global FX market. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Following the publication of the FX Global Code regulators are taking a new look at the spot FX market, and any decision to impose new regulations may affect our spot FX business line.\nBroker\n-\nDealer\nCboe Trading and BIDS Trading are registered broker-dealers regulated by the SEC, FINRA, other SROs of which they are members and various state securities regulators. Cboe Trading currently operates as a routing broker-dealer for sending orders from the Exchanges to other venues for execution, including routing orders among the Exchanges. Cboe Trading is considered a facility of each of the Exchanges and is subject to the rules of the Exchanges. The Exchanges are responsible for enforcing Cboe Trading’s compliance with their rules, including to ensure Cboe Trading is not given preferential treatment. BIDS Trading currently operates an ATS, which is designed to bring counterparties together to anonymously trade large blocks of U.S. equities. BIDS Trading is not a member of any of the U.S. national securities exchanges and is not subject to exchange rules.\nCboe Trading and BIDS Trading are subject to SEC and SRO rules, as applicable, and, as registered broker-dealers, regulations concerning all aspects of their businesses, including trading practices, order handling, best execution, anti-money laundering, handling of material non-public information, safeguarding data, reporting, capital adequacy, record retention, market access and the conduct of their officers, employees and other associated persons. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct proceedings which can result in injunctions or other sanctions, censures, fines, the issuance of cease and desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. The SEC and FINRA impose certain minimum capital requirement rules that require notification when a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer, constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances and impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital.\n21\nIn addition, the ATS operated by BIDS Trading is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof, as such, Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges. The Chief Executive Officer of BIDS Trading is expected to lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the board of Cboe Global Markets. Further, Cboe Trading will not route orders to BIDS Trading on behalf of the Exchanges.\nCboe Global Markets\nCertain aspects of Cboe Global Markets are also subject to SEC, FCA and AFM oversight, including certain ownership and voting restrictions on its stockholders. The focus of the SEC’s regulation of Cboe Global Markets is to assure fair representation of members in the selection of the directors of the Exchanges, public participation in the governance of the Exchanges and that the Exchanges can satisfy their regulatory responsibilities under the Exchange Act. Furthermore, the SEC requires that Cboe Global Markets give due regard to the preservation of the independence of the self-regulatory function of the Exchanges\nand to Cboe Global Markets’ obligations to investors and the general public. The SEC also requires that Cboe Global Markets not take any actions that would interfere with the effectuation of any decisions by the Board of Directors of any of the Exchanges relating to its regulatory functions or the structure of the market that it regulates or that would interfere with the ability of such Exchange to carry out its responsibilities under the Exchange Act. To the extent that Cboe Global Markets’ business activities involve or relate to the Exchanges, the officers and directors of Cboe Global Markets may be deemed to be officers and directors of the exchanges for purposes of and subject to oversight under the federal securities laws. Accordingly, the SEC may exercise direct supervision and disciplinary authority over certain Cboe Global Markets’ activities and those activities may be subject to SEC approval and, in some cases, public notice and comment.\nIn addition, Cboe Global Markets indirectly holds all of the issued share capital and voting rights in Cboe Europe and its wholly owned subsidiaries, Cboe Chi-X Europe and Cboe NL. As a result, we and any person who holds, or has voting power with respect to, 10% or more of the outstanding shares of Cboe Global Markets common stock may be subject to certain regulatory requirements under UK and Dutch law.\nU.S. Regulatory Responsibilities\nOur U.S.-based exchanges are responsible for assessing the compliance of their TPHs or members, including Cboe Trading, with the respective exchange’s rules and the applicable rules of the SEC and/or CFTC. The main activities that the exchanges, as applicable, are required to monitor for the purpose of compliance with these rules include:\nIn order to ensure market integrity, we regulate and monitor our TPHs’ and members’ trading activities by using both our employees and third parties under regulatory services agreements (“RSAs”). See “Regulatory Agreements” below. Providing effective regulation is important for attracting and retaining the confidence and participation of market-makers, broker-dealers and institutional and retail investors.\nWe expend considerable time, financial resources and effort to ensure that the exchanges’ rules and regulations conform to regulatory best practices within the securities and futures exchange industries and within the regulatory regime overseen by the SEC and CFTC, our primary regulators. In order to support our efforts and those of our market participants to comply with applicable law and our exchange rules, we developed a regulatory program to monitor market activity on our exchanges.\nAll of our Exchanges and CFE are participants in the Intermarket Surveillance Group (“ISG”). ISG is an international information-sharing cooperative governed by a written agreement that provides for a comprehensive surveillance sharing arrangement. In addition to the agreement for confidential information sharing, the ISG provides a framework for the coordination of regulatory efforts among exchanges trading securities, commodity futures and related products to address potential intermarket manipulations and trading abuses.\n22\nAs part of the regulatory program, each of our Exchanges and CFE have rules pertaining to their respective disciplinary processes.\nU.S. Regulatory Agreements\nThe Exchanges and CFE have entered into agreements under which third parties have agreed to perform regulatory functions on behalf of our markets (e.g., RSAs). As discussed below, in addition, in certain other instances for our Exchanges, a third party has been allocated the regulatory responsibility under Rule 17d-1 or Rule 17d-2 under the Exchange Act, while in others, we retain the regulatory responsibility for the activities.\nRegulatory Services Agreement with FINRA\nThe Exchanges have entered into agreements with FINRA under which FINRA has agreed to provide regulatory services to the Exchanges. Under these agreements, FINRA performs certain regulatory functions on behalf of the Exchanges and, to avoid any potential conflicts of interest concerning the regulation and oversight of Cboe Trading, certain regulatory services specific to Cboe Trading. The Exchanges remain responsible for the regulation of their TPHs, members and marketplaces, and retain the authority for bringing disciplinary actions against their TPHs and members, although FINRA performs certain disciplinary-related functions on behalf of the Exchanges. Over the course of 2019 through 2021, certain regulatory and disciplinary-related functions that FINRA had performed on behalf of the Exchanges have been moved back in-house from FINRA.\nRegulatory Services Agreements with NFA and OCC\nThrough December 31, 2020, the NFA performed regulatory functions on behalf of CFE pursuant to an RSA with CFE. The RSA has been terminated and, starting January 1, 2021, these regulatory functions were moved in-house from the NFA. In addition, OCC has also performed and continues to perform certain regulatory functions on behalf of CFE pursuant to an RSA with CFE. CFE also performs other regulatory and disciplinary-related functions in-house. Whether performed under an RSA or in-house, CFE retains overall responsibility for the regulation of its marketplace and for bringing disciplinary actions. CFE is also a party to cooperative and regulatory information sharing agreements with other SROs and is a member of the ISG, described above.\nRule 17d-1 Designations and Rule 17d-2 Agreements\nSection 17(d) of the Exchange Act and the related Exchange Act rules permit SROs to allocate certain regulatory responsibilities to avoid duplicative oversight and regulation. Under Exchange Act Rule\n17d-1, the SEC designates one SRO to be the designated examining authority (“DEA”) for each broker-dealer that is a member of more than one SRO. The DEA is responsible for the regulatory oversight of applicable financial responsibility rules pertaining to that broker-dealer. Cboe Options is the DEA for several of its TPHs. Cboe Trading’s assigned DEA is FINRA.\nExchange Act Rule 17d-2 permits SROs to enter into agreements, commonly called Rule 17d-2 agreements, which are approved by the SEC and concern the allocation of regulatory responsibility for rules applicable to TPHs and members that those SROs have in common. The Exchanges have entered into certain bi-lateral Rule 17d-2 agreements under which FINRA is allocated responsibility for enforcing certain federal securities laws and certain exchange rules that are common with FINRA rules. The Exchanges have entered into certain other multi-party Rule 17d-2 agreements that allocate responsibility among the participating SROs, which may include the Exchanges, for oversight of their allocated common members compliance with certain rules governing, among other items, options related sales practices, options related market surveillance, insider trading, NMS and consolidated audit trail NMS plan (“CAT”) compliance.\nNational Market System Plans\nWe are member participants of several NMS plans including, but not limited to, the following: Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are member exchanges in OPRA, which is the designated securities information processor for market information that is generated through the trading of exchange-listed securities options in the United States, and it disseminates certain core trading information, such as last sale reports and quotations. Cboe Options, BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX also participate in the CTA/CQ and the UTP Plans, which perform analogous services for the U.S. equities market. Securities Information Automation Corporation (“SIAC”) acts as the “processor” for OPRA and the CTA/QC Plans. Nasdaq Stock Market, LLC acts as the processor for the Nasdaq Unlisted Trading Privileges Plan. Also, see “Regulatory Environment and Compliance - Recent Developments - United States - Consolidated Data Plan Order”, “Risk Factors” and “Legal Proceedings” for more information regarding the Consolidated Data Plan Order and the Plan.\n23\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Order Protection and Locked/Crossed Market Plan, which is designed to prohibit trade-throughs and avoid locked/crossed markets. Cboe Options, C2, BZX, and EDGX are also parties to the Options Listing Procedures Plan, which sets forth the procedures that the options exchanges must follow to list new options. Cboe Options, BZX, BYX, EDGA, and EDGX are also parties to the NMS plan for the selection and reservation of securities symbols.\nUnder the Options Regulatory Surveillance Authority Plan (“ORSA Plan”), U.S. securities options exchanges are permitted to act jointly in the administration, operation and maintenance of a regulatory system for the surveillance, investigation and detection of the unlawful use of undisclosed, material information in trading in one or more of their markets. The ORSA Plan is intended to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency with which the exchanges regulate their respective markets and to avoid duplication of certain regulatory efforts. FINRA operates the ORSA Plan facility for options insider trading.\nThe CAT involves the creation of a comprehensive audit trail that strives to enhance regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in the U.S. securities markets through a phased implementation. Upon final implementation of the provisions of the CAT, data will be required to be reported to a central repository the following day by each SRO (a “Plan Participant”) and broker-dealer (an “Industry Member”). On November 15, 2016, the SEC approved the CAT. The first of various phases of CAT were originally required to begin in November 2017; however, there have been some delays. In 2017, Thesys CAT LLC (“Thesys”), a subsidiary of Thesys Technologies, LLC, was selected as the plan processor with the responsibility to build and operate the CAT. The first phase of CAT ultimately went live in November 2018, at which time we and other SROs/Plan Participants began initial reporting to the CAT. In 2019, Thesys was replaced by a new plan processor, FINRA CAT, LLC, a subsidiary of FINRA. The second phase for Industry Member order and trade file submissions is now live and began in June 2020 (for equities), June/July 2020 (for options), and additional sub-phases related to order and trade file submissions were implemented through December 2021. The final implementation sub-phase, related to broker-dealer customer and account information submissions by Industry Members, is now scheduled to go live in July 2022 (or by a subsequent date in the event the current deadline is extended). While the funding of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both the SROs/Plan Participants (which includes our U.S.-based securities exchanges) and Industry Members, until fee filings associated with the funding model are effective with or approved by the SEC, the funding to date has solely been provided by the SROs/Plan Participants. The funding by the SROs/Plan Participants has been done in exchange for promissory notes expected to be repaid once such Industry Member fees are collected. Until those fees are collected, the SROs/Plan Participants may continue to incur additional significant costs, including as a result of replacing the plan processor, or result in the uncollectibility of promissory notes related to the funding of the implementation and operation of the CAT. See Note 8 (“Credit Losses”) and Note 9 (“Other Assets, Net”) for further information. In addition, on February 14, 2021, Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC, formed by SRO Plan Participants to implement the CAT requirements, filed motions to stay all or portions of two exemptive orders the SEC issued on December 16, 2020 related to the implementation of the CAT. On February 16, 2021, Consolidated Audit Trail, LLC also petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (“D.C. Circuit”) for judicial review of the two exemptive orders, asserting that the orders are unlawful. On April 7, 2021, the D.C. Circuit ordered the case to remain in abeyance, directed the filing of status reports every 60 days and ordered the parties “to file motions to govern future proceedings within 30 days after the discussions between the parties and the agency proceedings are completed.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe own or have rights to a number of intellectual property assets, including trademarks, service marks, domain names, trade names, copyrights, trade secrets and patents. While the majority of our intellectual property is protected under U.S. law, we have many intellectual property assets protected by laws in Europe, Asia and other parts of the world. We license some intellectual property assets to other entities. We attempt to protect our intellectual property rights, while respecting the legitimate intellectual property rights of others.\nHuman Capital Management\nCboe has a robust human capital management program in place focused on equal opportunities including diversity, equity and inclusion (“DEI”), performance and career development, health and well-being, comprehensive benefits, training, talent acquisition, and succession planning. Additional information on our approach to human capital and ESG issues can be found in the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. Environmental, Social and Governance Report located in the Corporate Social Responsibility section of our website at https://markets.cboe.com/about/corporate-social-responsibility, which does not form a part of this Form 10-K.\n24\nEqual Opportunity, Diversity, and Pay Equity\nCboe believes in a culture of diversity and inclusion that promotes creativity, collaboration and innovation, which is critical to the success of our business and defining the markets of tomorrow. Cboe is an equal opportunity employer and provides equal employment opportunities to all qualified persons without regard to sex, race, color, ethnicity, creed, religion, national origin, ancestry, citizenship status, age, veteran or military status, disability, marital status, domestic partnership or civil union status, pregnancy, sexual orientation, genetic status, gender identity or expression, and any other characteristic protected by law (a “Protected Characteristic”). Cboe is committed to applying our Equal Employment Opportunity Policy to all employment practices that impact the terms and conditions of employment including, but not limited to, hiring, evaluation, discipline, promotion, training, compensation, transfer, and termination. Actively nurturing and maintaining a diverse and inclusive culture at Cboe is a core imperative. We believe that our collective and unique perspectives fuel our capabilities, enhance our team spirit and enable us to attract and retain top talent as we define the markets of the future. Our commitment and responsibility in this regard starts at the top, with leadership and support from the full Cboe Board of Directors and executive team.\nOne of the most compelling examples of our pledge to equality, diversity and inclusion throughout our Company is the completion of our first pay equity study in 2019. In 2020, we finalized the implementation of the findings of our inaugural study. To maintain and strengthen our efforts in this area, we also review the critical touchpoints across the employee journey with Cboe to keep a level playing field, from the talent selection, promotion, leadership development and succession planning processes and make adjustments, as necessary, to ensure opportunity parity across the Company. Our goal is to ensure that equal pay and equal opportunity for all that results in a collaborative, high performing organization bringing new innovations to market and providing superior service to our customers.\nThe Cboe Women’s Initiative works toward its mission:\nto increase representation, strengthen voices, and build a culture of opportunity and advancement for the women of Cboe\n. The Women’s Initiative is led by an associate board and engages women throughout the Company on a variety of programs. More specifically, the Women’s Initiative is comprised of three committees that target areas where its membership strives to promote change, such as networking events,  building a formal mentorship program and an advocacy group aimed at gathering input on topics of importance for its membership. This outreach helps shape the planning and focus for the Initiative. Networking events include the “Trailblazers” events where senior women share their success stories through personal accounts of career growth and impact and speakers on Male Allyship in the workplace. In its first year, the mentorship program paired over 45 mentors with mentees across the Company\n.\nWe are also proud to share that Cboe recently formed an employee Diversity Leadership Council in 2020 focused on unlocking the potential of a variety of perspectives, capabilities and cultural experiences. We believe in a culture of diversity and inclusion that promotes creativity, collaboration and innovation, which is critical to the success of our business and defining the markets of tomorrow. To reinforce this belief, this council is a collective voice on how Cboe strives to create a diverse workforce that reflects the world in which we operate. Further, they are charged with oversight on how we build an inclusive culture where every employee feels welcome, safe and empowered. In 2021, we also created a new DEI leadership position within our human resources organization to be accountable for helping to establish the strategy and execution of our DEI approach to attract develop and retain top diverse talent while fostering a community of belonging and inclusion.\nTo reinforce our commitment to organizational wide education and commitment to diversity and inclusion we provided a full-day Unconscious Bias training through third-party experts for all managers around the globe in 2020 with the commitment to continue the rollout of this program for all employees.\nIn addition, in 2021, we launched Cboe Empowers and Cboe’s Veterans Initiative. Cboe Empowers is a community engagement program that provides mentorship, scholarship and guidance to under-resourced students throughout their educational journey through access to Cboe's associates, resources, work environment and other learning and experience opportunities. Initially launched in Chicago, the vision for Cboe Empowers is to support students through all stages of education from elementary or primary school to career by providing mentorship, learning and experience opportunities, professional development and scholarships to students within the Chicago Public School system and graduates pursuing higher education. Cboe Empowers expects to supplement its own programs by collaborating with local partners, including the Greenwood Project and Working in the Schools, to help create maximum impact for its participants. The Cboe Veterans Initiative is an Associate Resource Group that operates based on four main pillars: recruiting, mentorship, service, and networking. The vision for the Cboe Veterans Initiative is to actively seek Veteran talent, provide mentorship to veterans within and outside of the Company, commit to giving back to the Veteran community through financial and non-monetary support, and encourage outreach to Cboe Veterans.\n25\nPerformance and Career Development\nCboe expects employees to perform their duties to the best of their ability and to develop their competencies for career growth. We recognize the need to provide ongoing, timely, and constructive performance feedback. Cboe has designed a Performance Management Program that drives the professional development of our employees while also providing fair and equitable rewards and recognition.\nThe principles of performance management include:\nTo help promote employee career development, we started in 2021 and are planning to launch in 2022, SCOUT, which is an AI powered talent management tool that will help us deliver internal mobility and career development opportunities for our employees.\nEmployee Health and Well-Being and Comprehensive Benefits Program\nCboe’s vision is to support the overall wellness of employees and their families through education and activities that encourage a healthy lifestyle, resulting in improved health and productivity. Our programs and benefit plans provide a corporate atmosphere of collective well-being that incorporate strategies for physical, emotional, mental and financial wellness. Our programs focused on enhanced employee assistance programs, wellness programs and challenges, that include both mental and physical wellbeing, and webinars and classes through our retirement vendor to support the financial health of our employees.\nTo further these efforts, we launched the CboeFit program that creates an opportunity to elevate these programs and strengthen employee engagement as we execute against our wellness vision and strategies. With the global pandemic in 2020 and 2021, there was further focus on our Employee Assistance program that was strengthened across the globe with a diverse set of mental health resources aimed at supporting our employees during a unique and challenging time.\nEmployee Engagement and Pulse Surveys, Town Halls and an Open-Door Policy\nIn 2021, Cboe conducted our fourth annual employee engagement survey and has implemented career, leadership, and culture focused programs in response to the survey findings. Our participation rate exceeds standard benchmarks and a significant majority of our employees would recommend Cboe as a great place to work. To further cement our commitment to Diversity and Inclusion, we added new, enhanced questions in this area. Our Diversity Leadership Council hosted a special focus group to review these specific results to listen to the voices of our diverse population, prioritize their feedback and ideas, and create commitments for actionable improvements.\nOur senior management team continues to hold the commitment to an open-door policy and encourages the free flow of information and communication in furtherance of active transparency. With the global pandemic, our ability to tap into the voice of our employees was critically important. We conducted regular pulse surveys to gauge sentiment in making critical decisions. Our CEO also issues weekly letters to help connect with our employees. Human Resources also provided ongoing regular resources and tips to help support the variety of challenges from the new reality of fully remote work to childcare and elder care that our employees faced throughout 2021.\nCboe also continues to create an open and frank atmosphere in which any grievance, complaint, suggestion or question receives a timely response. Cboe offers a whistleblower hotline for complaints, which can be made anonymously. Additionally, employees can raise questions and suggestions to the Cboe Human Resources team either in-person or via a group email address and are either responded to individually or addressed at our Global Town Hall meetings. The objective of these town halls is to provide employees an update on Company news, share updates from major business lines, as well as provide a forum to ask questions and offer feedback. Town halls can include updates on anything from legislation that may impact our business to ESG topics. Employees are encouraged to participate in free\n26\nflow of information and communication and to offer positive and constructive feedback in furtherance of active transparency.\nTo further reinforce our commitment to employee engagement as a result of changing work styles due to COVID-19, we began in late 2021 a future-of-work study with a third party to help determine where Cboe employees might be best suited to work from in the future, whether it is in the office, remotely, or a hybrid mix.\nTraining and Succession Planning\nWe believe that the development of all Cboe employees helps drive our collective success. Through skill and competency development we signal our investment in all while also enabling enhanced productivity. Through our tuition reimbursement program, our employees receive financial support in their pursuit of specialized university courses and degrees. In addition to our ongoing offering of online courses on diverse topics through our corporate university, CboeU, employees can participate in the CboeLearns hybrid program focused on virtual classroom instruction combined with work application and CboeLive, which is focused on business topics to foster organizational-wide knowledge sharing and education.\nLeadership is another critical element to our success at Cboe. People managers globally participated in a two-day training focused on the “4 Essential Roles of Leadership” (1. Inspire Trust; 2. Create Vision; 3. Execute Strategy; 4. Coach Potential). We expanded on our leadership training through the design and launch of a bespoke 8-week program, CboeLeads, expanding on the development of our high potential leaders further strengthening the leadership bench and accelerating readiness of this key talent pool. The senior management team participated in an additional one-day workshop focused on their roles that was also accompanied by Leadership toolkits to guide an enhanced approach to coaching and career conversations.\nCboe has held several succession planning discussions with the Compensation Committee and Board of Directors to plan for the fulfillment of essential roles, such as the CEO and other senior officers. This process includes investments in advanced development planning for targeted successors to accelerate their readiness through key internal projects and assignments as well as tailored training. Diversity and inclusion are a formal part of Cboe's succession planning process as we work to identify and advance internal diverse talent and, in parallel, continually scan external talent pools for successors.\nEmployees\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed 1,196 individuals, 820 of whom are based in the United States, 128 of whom are located in London, England, 9 of whom are located in Belfast, Northern Ireland, 9 of whom are located in the Greater Toronto Area, Ontario, Canada, 18 of whom are located in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, 1 of whom are located in Coquitlam, British Columbia, 86 of whom are located in Amsterdam, Netherlands, 35 of whom are located in Sydney, Australia, 17 of whom are located in Tokyo, Japan, 51 of whom are located in Manila, Philippines, 15 of whom are located in Hong Kong, 5 of whom are located in Singapore, and 2 of whom are located in Switzerland.

Management believes that we have strong relationships with our employees, and we have never experienced a work stoppage.\n27\nInformation about our Executive Officers\nSet forth below is information regarding our executive officers:\n​\nEdward T. Tilly.\nMr. Tilly is our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer. Mr. Tilly has served as our President since January 2019, Chairman since February 2017 and as CEO and director since May 2013.

    "text": "The risks and uncertainties described below are those that we believe are material at this time relating to our business. These risks and uncertainties, however, are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem to be immaterial may also significantly impact us. Any of these risks and uncertainties may materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, liquidity, and cash flows.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the key risks and uncertainties described below that we believe are material to us at this time:\n​\nRisks Relating to Our Business\nLoss of our right to exclusively list and trade certain index options and futures could have a material adverse effect on our financial performance.\nWe hold exclusive licenses to list securities index options on the S&P 500 Index, the Russell 2000 Index, as well as others, granted to us by the owners of such indices, and additionally hold exclusive rights to our proprietary VIX methodology that provides the basis for VIX options and futures. In 2021, approximately 53.2% of our net transaction and clearing fees (defined below) were generated by futures and index options, the overwhelming majority of which were\n30\ngenerated by our exclusively-licensed products (e.g., SPX options) and products based on our proprietary VIX methodology (e.g., VIX options and futures). The bulk of this revenue is attributable to our SPX options and VIX options and futures. As a result, our revenues less cost of revenues are dependent in large part on the exclusive licenses we hold for these products and our ability to maintain our exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX methodology and related products and indices.\nThere is a risk, with respect to each of our current exclusive licenses, that the owner of the index may not renew the license with us on an exclusive basis or at all. In the first event, we would be subject to multiple listing in the trading of what is now an index product traded by us on an exclusive basis, which could result in a loss of market share and negatively impact our profitability. In the second event, we could lose the right to list the index product entirely. The loss or limited use of any of our exclusive index licenses, especially for the S&P 500 Index, for any reason could have a material adverse effect on our business and profitability.\nIn addition to the risks related to our exclusive licenses, if we are unable to retain exclusive proprietary rights in the VIX methodology and related products and indices, our volatility products could be subject to multiple listing which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nThe EU has adopted legislation affecting providers and users of benchmark indices in the EU. MiFIR requires benchmarks used to value a financial instrument in the EU to be made available on a non-discriminatory basis to all EU trading venues and central counterparty clearinghouses for the purposes of trading and clearing. As a result, owners of such benchmarks must provide licenses on fair, reasonable and non-discriminatory terms. While similar legislation to MiFIR has not been proposed in the U.S., if it were passed, it could cause us to lose our exclusive rights to list and trade proprietary and licensed index products. Further, in 2018, the EU implemented the EU Benchmark Regulation, which regulates users, data providers and calculators of benchmarks (“administrators”) in the EU, and among other things, prohibits use of benchmarks provided by administrators outside the EU in connection with EU financial instrument unless the administrator is deemed to be subject to an EU equivalent regulatory regime and the benchmark is registered in an EU member state. These regulations and other emerging regulatory regimes around the world may impact international customers’ interest in or ability to trade index-based products listed on our U.S. exchanges, as well as impact our expansion into foreign trading of our index-based products and our ability to license proprietary indices for use outside of the U.S.\nFurthermore, our competitors may succeed in developing, offering and providing a market for the trading of index-based or volatility products that are economically similar to those that we offer and they may become successful and take away volume from our products. It is also possible that a third party may offer trading in index-based products that are the same as those that are the subject of one of our exclusive licenses, but in a jurisdiction in which the index owner cannot require a license or in a manner otherwise not limited by our exclusive license.\nThe value of our licenses to exclusively list securities index options and futures also depends on the continued ability of index owners to require licenses for the trading of options and futures based on their indices. Although we and other index owners have prevailed in legal actions seeking to challenge our rights to exclusively license indices, we may be subject to changes in the law or other actions taken in the future that might impede our ability to exclusively offer trading in certain index options and futures.\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors beyond our control could significantly reduce demand for our products and services and harm our business.\nThe volume of trading and clearing transactions and the demand for our products and services are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere in the world that are beyond our control, including:\n31\nAny of these factors, individually or collectively, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading and clearing volumes and demand for market data.\nOur business may be adversely affected by price competition.\nThe securities industry is characterized by intense price competition, especially with respect to transaction fees. We may be required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. We also compete with respect to the pricing of market data and value-added market data, such as historical market data.\nIn our options segment, the pricing model for trade execution has changed in response to competitive market conditions, and our competitors have adjusted transaction fees and fee structures accordingly, including by opening new exchanges, which allow them to offer multiple pricing models that can appeal to different segments of market participants. These changes have resulted in significant pricing pressures on us, especially on transaction fees and incentives for multi-listed products. As a result of these pricing pressures, our average rate per multi-listed options contract may decrease. It is likely that this pressure will continue and even intensify as our competitors continue to seek to increase their share of trading by further reducing their transaction fees or by offering other financial incentives to order providers and liquidity providers to induce them to direct orders to their markets.\nIn addition, one or more competitors may engage in aggressive pricing strategies and significantly decrease or completely eliminate their profit margin for a period of time in order to capture a greater share of trading volume. Some order-providing firms on our exchanges have taken ownership positions in options exchanges that compete with us and such exchanges have given those firms added economic incentives to direct orders to them.\nWith respect to our proprietary products, we compete with futures exchanges and swap execution facilities that offer similar products and other financial market participants that offer over-the-counter derivatives. We also compete against certain multi-listed options products, such as SPY, which offer some of the features of our proprietary products, such as SPX.\nTo attract market share, we may offer “inverted” pricing specials or no-transaction fee trading from time to time, per various fee schedules across our equities exchanges. These forms of promotions, along with other supplemental liquidity programs, may adversely affect our profitability.\nFurther, regulatory and legal developments could also impact our ability to adjust pricing to respond to actions by new or existing competitors. In the U.S., we are generally required to file with the SEC any changes to the fees that we charge and in recent years the SEC has more heavily scrutinized pricing changes.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully with respect to the pricing of our services and products, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially and adversely affected. We could lose a substantial percentage of our share of trading if we are unable to price transactions in a competitive manner. Also, our profits could decline if competitive pressures or regulatory changes force us to reduce fees.\n32\nA significant portion of our operating revenues is generated by our transaction and clearing-based business. If the amount of trading volume on our markets or clearing volume decreases, or the product mix shifts to lower revenue products, our revenues from transaction and clearing fees will most likely decrease.\nIn 2021, approximately 64.7% of our revenues less cost of revenues were generated by our transaction and clearing-based business. This business is dependent on our ability to attract and maintain order flow, both in absolute terms and relative to other market centers. If the amount of trading volume on our Exchanges, CFE, BIDS Trading, and MATCHNow, notional value traded on Cboe FX, Cboe SEF, Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives, Cboe Australia, and Cboe Japan or clearing volumes at EuroCCP decreases, we are likely to see a decrease in fees.\nOur total trading or clearing volumes could decline if our market participants reduce their trading or clearing activity for any reason, such as:\nOver the past few years, a number of legislative actions have been taken, both domestically and internationally, that may cause market participants to be subject to increased capital requirements and additional compliance burdens. These actions, including the Collins Amendment to Dodd-Frank, MiFID II and MiFIR, may cause market participants to reduce trading activity on our markets.\nIn addition, the transaction fees generated are different based on type of product and other factors, including the type of customer and certain volume discounts. If the amount of our trading volume decreases, the mix traded shifts to our lower revenue per contract products, our revenues from transaction fees will most likely decrease. We can offer no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs to match the amount of any such decrease.\nRevenues from our market data fees and access and capacity fees may be reduced due to declines in our market share, trading volumes or regulatory changes.\nThe occurrence of any event that reduces the amount of market data fees that we receive, whether as a result of fee reductions, fewer members subscribing to the U.S. tape plans or other market data offerings, declines in market share, trading volumes, or notional volumes, or regulatory changes may have a direct negative impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results. For example, if our market share of U.S. listed equities and options or Cboe’s European equities trading volume were to decline, our share of market data fees could also decline. Moreover, market data fees could decline as a result of a reduction in the number of market data users, for example because of consolidation among market data subscribers or due to a decline in professional subscriptions as a result of staff reductions in the financial services industry or otherwise.\nRegulatory and legal developments could also impact the fees we receive from market data and access and capacity, or our cost in providing such services. In the U.S., we are generally required to file with the SEC any changes to the fees that we charge for our securities market data products and access and capacity fees. In recent years, certain industry groups have objected to the ability of exchanges to charge for certain market data products. In addition, the SEC and some media have scrutinized market data and market access. As discussed above, the implementation of the new Market Data Infrastructure rules could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules, which may have a material impact on our business, financial condition, and operating results, including if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\nIn addition, as discussed above, the SEC approved a Consolidated Data Plan to replace the three equity data plans that govern the dissemination of real-time, consolidated market data for NMS stocks. Such plan is being challenged, but if such Consolidated Data Plan were to be implemented, it may have a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan. See “Legal Proceedings” for more information.\n33\nWe believe Cboe Europe Equities and Derivatives currently offers market data to customers on a non-discriminatory basis at a reasonable cost. As European regulators determine how market data should be disaggregated and what is a reasonable commercial basis for providing market data, it could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner that we do today thereby causing an adverse effect on our European market data revenues. While MiFID II and MiFIR aim to encourage a commercial solution to a consolidated tape in Europe, should this fail to materialize, policy makers might be encouraged to implement a mandatory solution that could impact our ability to develop our own commercial offering.\nAs discussed above, the E.C. published provisions for a consolidated tape for the EU, which is expected to be implemented in late 2023 or early 2024. As proposed, these provisions may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, we must reduce the fees we charge for market data.\nThe technology upon which we rely, including those of our service providers, may be vulnerable to security risks, cybersecurity risks, insider threats, unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, operational disruptions, and other risks and events that could harm our business.\nThe secure and reliable operation of our technology, including our computer systems and communications networks, and those of our service providers, market participants and other third-parties, is a critical element of our operations. These systems and networks may be subject to various cybersecurity incidents, improper or inadvertent access to or disclosure of confidential, commercially sensitive, or personally identifiable information, data theft, corruption or destruction, cyber-attack, ransomware, supply chain attack, denial of service attack, malware and other security problems, as well as acts of terrorism, attacks by threat actors including criminal groups, political activist groups and nation-state actors, attacks in connection with geopolitical activity such as the recent escalating tensions along the Russia-Ukraine border, natural disasters, human error, criminal insider activity, employee error, power loss, service provider, market participant or third-party disruptions or security breaches and other events that are beyond our control. Our increased adoption of remote working, initially driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, usage of mobile and cloud-based technologies and amount of newly acquired companies and related integrations may increase our risk for a cybersecurity incident. Moreover, given our position in the global financial services industry and as critical infrastructure, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events. While we have experienced in the past, and we expect to continue to experience, cybersecurity threats and events of varying degrees, we are not aware of any of these threats or events having a material impact on our business, financial condition or operating results to date, however we cannot assure you that we will not experience future threats or events that may be material.\nWe currently maintain policies, procedures and controls designed to reasonably protect the confidentiality, integrity, availability and reliability of our systems, networks and information more broadly, and to guard against cybersecurity incidents and unauthorized access. These policies, procedures and controls are subject to periodic monitoring, auditing, and evaluation practices, pursuant to our enterprise risk management program, which is supported by a three lines of defense approach, and our other governance practices. Further, we developed and maintain cybersecurity and data privacy training programs for our employees and our third-party consultants who have access to our systems, which includes simulations, tabletop exercises, and response readiness tests. Independent third-party cybersecurity penetration assessments are also routinely performed. Collectively, these safeguards and measures or those of our third-party providers, including any cloud technologies, may prove inadequate to prevent the attendant risk posed by cybersecurity incidents, subjecting us to contractual restrictions, liability and damages, loss of business, penalties, unfavorable publicity, and increased scrutiny by our regulators, and materially impacting our business, financial condition and operating results. We may be required to expend significant resources in the event of any real or threatened breaches in security or system failures, including to protect against threatened breaches, to alleviate harm caused by an actual breach, and to address any reputational harm or litigation or regulatory liability. Despite our cybersecurity measures, it is possible for security vulnerabilities or breaches to remain undetected for an extended period of time. Such harms also could cause us to lose market participants, experience lower trading volume, and negatively impact our competitive advantage and business, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, as threats continue to evolve and increase, and as the domestic and international regulatory environment related to information security, data collection and use, and privacy becomes increasingly rigorous, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to modify and enhance our security controls and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf we fail to attract or retain highly skilled management and other employees our business may be harmed.\nOur success largely depends on the skills, experience and continued efforts of management and other key personnel. As a result, to be successful, we must retain and motivate executives and other key employees. However, we have no assurances that these employees will remain with us. The roles and responsibilities of departing executive\n34\nofficers and employees will need to be filled either by existing or new officers and employees, which may require us to devote time and resources to identifying, hiring and integrating replacements for the departed executives and employees that could otherwise be used to pursue business opportunities, which could have a material adverse effect on our overall business, financial condition and operating results.\nThere is substantial competition for qualified and capable personnel in the technology space, which may make it difficult for us to retain and recruit qualified employees in sufficient numbers. This competition has become exacerbated by the increase in employee resignations currently taking place throughout the United States as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is commonly referred to as the “great resignation,” as well as the growth of new asset classes such as the digital asset space. During this great resignation, we have faced increased challenges in retaining and attracting qualified employees. If we fail to retain our current employees, it would be difficult and costly to identify, recruit and train replacements needed to continue to conduct and expand our business. In particular, failure to retain and attract qualified technology personnel could result in systems failures. Consequently, our reputation may be harmed, we may incur additional costs and our profitability could decline. There can be no assurance that we will be able to retain and motivate our employees in the same manner as we\nhave historically done.\nAdditionally, effective succession planning is also important to our long-term success. Failure to ensure effective transfer of knowledge and smooth transitions involving our management team and key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution.\nIntense competition could materially adversely affect our market share and financial performance.\nThe market for trade execution services, clearing and products is intensely competitive in the asset classes and geographies in which we operate. Increased competition may result in a decline in our share of trading activity and a decline in our revenues from transaction and clearing fees and market data fees, thereby materially adversely affecting our operating results. We compete with a number of entities on several different fronts, including the cost, quality and speed of our trade execution, functionality and ease of use of our trading and clearing platforms, range of our products and services, our technological innovation and adaptation and our reputation. In particular, we have seen increased competition from off-exchange venues, which have increased their share of trading activity. See “Business – Competition” for more information.\nSome of our competitors and potential competitors have greater financial, marketing, technological, personnel and other resources than we do. These factors may enable them to develop similar or more innovative products, to offer lower transaction and clearing fees or better execution to their customers or to execute their business strategies more quickly or efficiently than we can. In addition, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected if we cannot successfully develop, introduce and/or market new services and products or if we need to adopt costly and customized technology for our services and products.\nFurthermore, new or existing competitors may:\nIf our products, markets, services and technology are not competitive or we fail to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology, customer preferences and regulatory requirements or any significant delays in product development efforts our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed.\n35\nWe depend on third-party service providers for certain services that are important to our business. An interruption, significant increase in fees or cessation or impairment of such service by any third party could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe depend on a number of service providers, including clearing organizations such as OCC, NSCC, DTC, CDS, LCH, EuroCCP, our wholly-owned subsidiary, JSCC, ASX Clear Pty Ltd, and SIX x-clear; securities information processors such as the CTA, UTP Securities Information Processor and OPRA; regulatory and other service providers such as FINRA and OCC; the hosts of our data and disaster recovery centers; and various vendors of communications and networking products and services. In addition, we also depend on third party routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing transactions on our behalf. More specifically:\nWith respect to options, all contracts traded on our exchanges must be cleared through clearing members of OCC. At December 31, 2021, there were 97 TPHs that are clearing members of OCC. Two clearing members accounted for approximately 61.5% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC in 2021. The next largest clearing member accounted for approximately 23.5% of transaction and other fees collected through OCC. Additionally, the two largest clearing members clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX and at all of the options exchanges. Should one of these clearing members or liquidity providers exit the business or withdraw from our options exchanges, impose additional market-maker financial requirements or if market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member or other liquidity providers were unable to provide additional liquidity, this could create a significant disruption to the options markets, including ours.\nWe cannot provide assurance that any of these providers will be able to continue to provide these services in an efficient manner or that they will be able to adequately expand their services to meet our needs. An interruption or malfunction in or the cessation or impairment of an important service by a third party or disruption of a third party’s operations could cause us to halt trading in some or all of our products or our services, make us unable to conduct other aspects of our business, cause us to experience the loss of a significant number of market participants or cause us to\n36\nexperience a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our inability to make alternative arrangements, such as moving clearing to another clearing agency, in a timely manner, or at all, could have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf an index provider from which we have a license or a service provider with respect to proprietary products fails to maintain the quality and integrity of their indices or fails to perform under our agreements with them, if we fail to maintain the quality and integrity of our proprietary indices or indices and other values that we calculate as an index provider, or if customer preferences change, the revenues that are generated from the trading of proprietary products or the calculation and dissemination of index values may suffer.\nWe are a party to a number of license agreements that permit us to list tradeable products related to various indices that are among the most actively traded products on our exchanges. We also enter into agreements pursuant to which we act as an index provider and calculate and disseminate proprietary indices and other values. We believe that demand for our products is based in part on market perception of the quality and integrity of these indices. The quality and integrity of these indices are dependent on the ability of index providers, including us, to maintain the index. Maintenance includes ongoing index calculation, index rebalancing and dependance on index providers for a number of things, including the provision of index data. We also rely on index providers to enforce intellectual property rights against unlicensed uses of the indices and uses of the indices that infringe on our licenses. Some of our agreements concerning our proprietary products obligate the parties to those agreements to provide important services to us. If any of our index providers, including us, are unable to maintain the quality and integrity of indices, or if any of the index providers or service providers, including us, fail to perform their obligations under the agreements, trading in these products, and therefore transaction fees we receive, may be materially adversely affected or we may not receive the financial benefits of the agreements that we negotiated.\nDifferences in the calculations from methodologies described in published materials or incorrect calculations of spot VIX Index values or our other spot volatility indices, including those instances that we announced on July 30, 2021, or the failure to implement any planned remedial changes may result in the loss of perceived quality and integrity of our indices, loss of demand for our products, increased potential for investigations and enforcement proceedings, increased potential for failure to perform our obligations under agreements concerning our products or in our capacity as an index provider, and increased exposure to third party claims and related litigation expenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and its effects have had significant impacts on economies around the world. Further impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had significant impacts on economies around the world. Governments, public institutions, and other organizations around the world have taken, and may take additional or reimpose previous, emergency measures to combat COVID-19’s spread, including vaccination requirements, implementation of travel bans, stay-at-home orders, border closures, and closures of offices, factories, schools, public buildings and businesses. These measures may disrupt the supply chain and may interfere with the ability of our employees, vendors, technology equipment suppliers, data and disaster recovery centers, and other service providers to perform their respective responsibilities and obligations relative to the conduct of our business. In addition to uncertain expenses and impacts to our business we may incur due to COVID-19 as part of us providing a safe and healthy work and trading environment, employees working remotely from different locations and in connection with our return to our offices, we may also be subject to claims from employees or customers alleging failure to maintain safe premises and restrictions with respect to protocols relating to COVID-19. Further, changes in trading behavior, impacts to trading behavior due to market disruptions, additional temporary suspensions of open outcry trading, temporary regulatory measures and other future developments caused by the effects of COVID-19, including a re-occurrence of cases and the emergence of variants, could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products, market data and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows and could heighten many of the other risks described herein.\nOur operations outside of the U.S. expose us to currency risk.\nIn addition to our operations in the U.S., we have operations in the UK, continental Europe, Canada, Hong Kong, Australia, Japan, Philippines, and Singapore. We, therefore, have exposure to exchange rate movements between the British pound, the Euro, the Canadian dollar, the Hong Kong dollar, the Australian dollar, the Japanese Yen, the\n37\nPhilippine Peso, and the Singapore dollar against the U.S. dollar. Significant inflation or changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic or political conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, or changes in local interest rates. These exchange rate differences would affect the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations and financial condition into U.S. dollars as part of our consolidated financial statements.\nWe and our licensors may not be able to protect our respective intellectual property rights.\nWe rely on patent, trade secret, copyright and trademark laws, the law of the doctrine of misappropriation and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary technology, proprietary products, index methodologies and other proprietary rights. In addition, we rely on the intellectual property rights of our licensors in connection with our listing of exclusively-licensed index options and futures products. We and our licensors may not be able to prevent third parties from copying, or otherwise obtaining and using, our intellectual property without authorization, listing our proprietary or exclusively-licensed index products without licenses or otherwise infringing on our rights. We and our licensors may have to rely on litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights, determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or defend against claims of infringement or invalidity. We and our licensors may not be successful in this regard. Such litigation, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs to us, diversion of our resources or a reduction in our revenues, any of which could materially adversely affect our business.\nOur clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties.\n​\nWe are subject to risks related to operating our clearinghouse, EuroCCP, including the\nrisks of failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight, risks of default by clearing participants and counterparties, due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons, and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin and default funds. These risks\ncould subject our business to substantial losses, reputational harm, regulatory consequences, including litigation, fines and enforcement actions, and the inability to operate our business, including the continued development of the European derivatives buildout.\n​\nTo mitigate the credit risks related to defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties, including the market risk that we would only be able to close out a defaulting participant’s positions at a loss, there are minimum participation criteria to become a clearing participant and clearing participants are required to provide collateral to cover the margin requirement and default fund contributions. No guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient or provide absolute assurance against us experiencing financial losses from defaults by the participants or counterparties on their obligations. In addition, although such collateral is preferably held in European central banks and central securities depositories, there are occasions where commercial banks are used, which can expose us to risk of default by those banks. In addition, EuroCCP entered into a\n€\n1.5 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility that is available to be drawn by EuroCCP towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system, however we can give no assurance that this facility will be sufficient to meet all such obligations or sufficiently mitigate EuroCCP’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Substantial amounts of the collateral, and any amounts drawn under this facility, may be at risk if a clearing participant defaults on its obligations to our clearinghouse and its margin and default fund deposits are insufficient to meet its obligations. This facility is expected to terminate on June 30, 2022 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. We cannot assure you that the mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures will be sufficient to detect problems or to protect us from a default or that we will not be materially and adversely affected in the event of a significant default.\nComputer and communications systems failures and capacity constraints could harm our reputation and our business.\nOur business depends on the integrity and performance of our computer and communications systems. If our systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in trading outages, lower trading and clearing volumes, financial losses, decreased customer service and satisfaction and regulatory sanctions and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to conduct our business. Although we have a back-up plan with respect to our significant trading and key corporate systems, the back-up systems or disaster recovery plans may prove to be inadequate in the event of a systems failure or cyber-security breach. Despite having disaster recovery facilities, there can be no guarantees that we will be able to open an efficient, transparent and liquid marketplace, if we can open at all, following a systems failure. Moreover, with extended trading\n38\nhours, we have to operate our systems longer and have fewer non-trading hours to address any potential concerns with the systems on which we rely.\nOur markets and clearinghouse have experienced occasional systems failures and delays in the past and in the future our systems may fail, in whole or in part, or may operate slowly, causing one or more of the following:\nAny of these events may cause:\nAs a consequence of any of these events, our business, financial condition and results of operations could suffer materially.\nIn addition to other measures, we test our systems to confirm whether they will be able to handle anticipated present and future peak trading and clearing activity or times of unusual market volatility. However, we cannot assure you that our estimates of future trading or clearing volume will be accurate or that our systems will always be able to accommodate actual trading or clearing volume without failure or degradation of performance.\nWe anticipate that we will need to continue to make significant investments in hardware, software and telecommunications infrastructure to accommodate the increases in traffic. If we cannot increase the capacity and capabilities of our systems to accommodate increasing trading or clearing activity and to execute our business strategy, our ability to maintain or expand our businesses would be materially adversely affected.\nOur use of open source software code may subject our software to general release or require us to re\n-\nengineer our software, which could harm our business.\nOur technology platform uses open source software code. Companies that incorporate open source software into their products have, from time to time, faced claims challenging the ownership of open source software. As a result, we could be subject to suits by parties claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. In addition, some open source software licenses require users who distribute open source software as part of their software to publicly disclose all or part of the source code in their software and make any derivative works of the open source code available on unfavorable terms or at no cost. Open source license terms may be ambiguous, and many of the risks associated with usage of open source software cannot be eliminated. We believe that our use of open source software is in compliance with the relevant open source software licenses and does not require disclosure of any of our source code. However, if we were found to have inappropriately used open source software, we may be required to release our proprietary source code, re-engineer or discontinue use of our software or take other remedial action any or all of which could cause disruptions in, or impose significant costs on, our business.\nDamage to our reputation could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe believe one of our competitive strengths is our strong industry reputation. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to:\n39\nDamage to our reputation could cause a reduction in the trading volume of our proprietary products or on our markets or cause us to lose customers. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFinancial or other problems experienced by third parties could have an adverse effect on our business.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, clearing agents and counterparties. For example, we are exposed to credit risk for transaction fees we bill to customers on a monthly basis in arrears. Our customers and other third parties may default on their obligations to us due to a lack of liquidity, operational failure, bankruptcy or other reasons. For additional credit risks related to our clearinghouse operations, see the Risk Factor “Our clearinghouse operations expose us to associated risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the defaults of clearing participants and other counterparties.”\nIn addition, with respect to orders Cboe Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Cboe Trading is exposed to counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our routing and clearing firms that are involved in processing equities and options transactions on our behalf, as well as failure on the part of such brokers to pass back any transactional rebates. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee equity trades until one day after the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. Thus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to an equity trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that Wedbush or Morgan Stanley fails to perform. Additionally, BIDS Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to BOA related to clearing until the day following the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. With respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver reports of matched trades of our customers to CDS, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, we deliver matched trades of our customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Australia. With respect to Japanese equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the JSCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Japan and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Japan.\nWith respect to routed U.S. equity transactions, Cboe Trading has counterparty credit risk exposure to Wedbush and Morgan Stanley related to clearing until the day following the trade date. Cboe Trading uses Wedbush to clear trades routed through affiliates of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC as well as for trades routed directly to other exchanges and optionally dark pools. Morgan Stanley clears trades routed through the Morgan Stanley routing brokers and also clears executions routed to most dark pools. Cboe Trading maintains counterparty credit risk exposure from routing brokers with respect to rebates earned until completion of the routing brokers next invoice cycle following the execution.\n40\nWith respect to U.S. listed equity and exchange traded product options, Cboe Trading is subject to counterparty credit risk exposure with respect to rebates earned from routing brokers until completion of the routing brokers’ next invoice cycle has completed for an execution.\nOur exposure to credit risk may be further impacted by volatile securities markets that may affect the ability of our customers, counterparties and other third parties to satisfy their obligations to us. Moreover, we may not be successful in managing our credit risk through mitigating measures, policies, safeguards and risk management procedures, reporting and control procedures or by maintaining credit standards. Any losses arising from such defaults or other credit losses could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results.\nWhile neither Cboe FX nor Cboe SEF has direct counterparty risk, Cboe FX or Cboe SEF may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Cboe FX and Cboe SEF may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade spot FX on the Cboe FX platform, or NDFs on Cboe SEF.\nWe may be required to assume ownership of a position in securities in connection with our order routing service, which could subject us to trading losses when our broker-dealer disposes of that position.\nWe offer a smart-order routing service through our broker-dealer subsidiary, Cboe Trading, which provides its customers with access to other market centers when we route their orders to those market centers for execution. In connection with this service, we may assume ownership of a position in securities. This may occur, for example, when a market center to which we have routed a customer’s order experiences systemic issues and is unable to determine the status of that order. When this happens, we may make a business decision to provide a cancellation notice to our customer, relieving our customer of any liability with respect to the order. We may be informed later, however, that the order was executed at the market center to which we routed it, in which case Cboe Trading would be required to take ownership of that securities position. Our third party clearing brokers maintain error accounts on behalf of Cboe Trading into which such positions settle, and we require the respective clearing broker to trade out of those positions as expeditiously as possible, which could result in our incurring trading losses.\nWe may not effectively manage our growth, which could materially harm our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe expect that our business will continue to grow, which may place a significant strain on our management, personnel, systems and resources. We must continually improve our operational, financial and regulatory systems and managerial controls and procedures, and may need to continue to expand, train and manage our workforce. We must also maintain close coordination among our technology, legal, accounting, finance, marketing, sales, regulatory and compliance functions. If we fail to manage our growth effectively, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. Furthermore, failure to successfully expand into new asset classes, such as the digital asset space or U.S. Treasuries, or new geographies may materially adversely affect our growth strategy and our future profitability.\nOur continued growth will require increased investment by us in technology, facilities, personnel, and financial and management systems and controls. It also will require expansion of our procedures for monitoring and assuring our compliance with applicable regulations, and we will need to integrate, train and manage a growing employee base. The expansion of our existing businesses, any expansion into new businesses and the resulting growth of our employee base will increase our need for internal audit and monitoring processes, which may be more extensive and broader in scope than those we have historically required. We may not be successful in identifying or implementing all of the processes that are necessary. Further, unless our growth results in an increase in our revenues that is proportionally greater than or equal to the increase in our costs associated with this growth, our business, financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected.\nWe selectively explore acquisition opportunities and strategic alliances relating to other businesses, products or technologies. We may not be successful in integrating other businesses, products or technologies with our business. Any such transaction also may not produce the results we anticipate, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe selectively explore and pursue acquisition and other opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our Company. We may enter into business combination transactions, make acquisitions or enter into strategic partnerships, joint ventures or alliances, any of which may be material. The market for acquisition targets and strategic alliances is\n41\nhighly competitive, which could make it more difficult to find appropriate merger or acquisition opportunities. If we are required to raise capital by incurring debt or issuing additional equity for any reason in connection with a strategic acquisition or investment, financing may not be available or the terms of such financing may not be favorable to us and our stockholders, whose interests may be diluted by the issuance of additional stock.\nFor example, at the end of 2021, we announced the planned acquisitions of ErisX, an operator of a U.S. based digital asset spot market, a regulated futures exchange and a regulated clearinghouse, and NEO, a Canadian securities exchange with a diverse product and services set ranging from corporate listings to cash equity trading. These planned acquisitions are expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Further, in 2021 we purchased Chi-X Asia Pacific, a holding company of alternative market operators in Australia and Japan, and in 2020, we purchased Hanweck and the assets of FT Options, which are providers of risk analytics market data, the assets of Trade Alert, a real-time alerts and order flow analysis service provider, EuroCCP, an operator of a European clearinghouse, and MATCHNow, an operator of an equities ATS in Canada. At the end of 2020, we also purchased BIDS Trading, a registered broker-dealer and operator of the BIDS ATS in the U.S., which is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof. Cboe intends to maintain the BIDS ATS as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the Exchanges.\nThe process of integration, including in new geographies and asset classes with new regulatory regimes, may expose us to a number of unforeseen risks and operating difficulties, including risks relating to information technology integration and security, regulatory issues and employee issues, and may divert the attention of management from the ongoing operation of our business and harm our reputation. We may not successfully achieve the integration objectives, and we may not realize the anticipated cost savings, revenue growth and synergies in full or at all, or it may take longer to realize them than expected, any of which could negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFor additional risks related to our potential consummation of the ErisX acquisition, see the Risk Factors Section entitled “Risks Relating to Our Business Following Consummation of ErisX Acquisition” below.\nRisks Relating to Legal and Regulatory Matters\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and other legal proceedings if we fail to comply with legal and regulatory obligations.\nCboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA are registered national securities exchanges and SROs, and, as such, are subject to comprehensive regulation by the SEC. CFE is a DCM and Cboe SEF is a SEF, each registered with the CFTC and subject to comprehensive regulation by the CFTC. In addition to its other SRO responsibilities, BZX, as a listing market, also is responsible for evaluating applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on BZX and monitoring each issuer’s compliance with BZX’s continued listing standards. The Exchanges may be subject to additional responsibilities in other international jurisdictions where the Exchanges may be authorized to act as foreign exchanges. Failure to comply with these SRO and other responsibilities could result in potential sanctions or fines and a negative impact on Cboe’s reputation and/or branding.\nOur European businesses are subject to regulatory oversight in the UK by the FCA and in the Netherlands by the DNB and the AFM, which, through the “passporting” regime, provides authorization to carry on business in other Member States of the EU and the EEA in accordance with the applicable EU legislation and regulation to which our European business is subject. MATCHNow is subject to regulatory oversight in Canada by the IIROC and the OSC. Cboe Australia is subject to regulatory oversight in Australia by the ASIC. Cboe Japan is subject to regulatory oversight in Japan by the JFSA and the JSDA. BIDS Trading is a registered broker-dealer subject to regulatory oversight in the U.S. by the SEC and FINRA and is expected to be maintained as an independently managed and operated trading venue, separate from and not integrated with the SROs. The Chief Executive Officer of BIDS Trading is expected to lead BIDS Trading as an independent business within Cboe, reporting into an independent committee of the Board of Directors of Cboe Global Markets. If a regulatory authority makes a finding of non-compliance, conditional fines could be imposed, and our licenses could be revoked. Any such fine or revocation of a license could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to the requirements related to operating our U.S. markets imposed by the SEC and the CFTC, we also have certain responsibilities for regulating the TPHs and members that trade on our Exchanges. While we have entered into agreements under which FINRA, with respect to our options and equities exchanges provides certain regulatory services, we retain ultimate responsibility for the regulation of our TPHs and members. We have begun to perform\n42\ninternally more of the regulatory services that FINRA used to handle and now perform internally the regulatory functions that NFA previously handled on behalf of CFE.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on the establishment and maintenance of appropriate systems and procedures, our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel, the ability of FINRA and OCC to perform under their respective RSAs, the ability of FINRA and OCC to transition to us any other potential responsibilities under their respective RSAs, our ability to complete the new additional responsibilities for regulating our TPHs and members and our oversight of the work done by FINRA and OCC. The SEC and CFTC have broad powers to audit, investigate and enforce compliance and to punish noncompliance by, as applicable, SROs, DCMs and SEFs pursuant to applicable laws, rules and regulations.\nIf a regulatory authority were to find one of our programs of enforcement or compliance to be deficient, our SROs, DCM, or SEF could be the subject of investigations and enforcement proceedings that may result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of registration as a national securities exchange, DCM, or SEF. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, our SROs, DCM, or SEF may be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.\nIn addition, SROs are required by federal law to perform a variety of regulatory functions. In light of these responsibilities, some courts have held that SROs are immune to certain private causes of action relating to the performance of these regulatory functions. There is a risk that some courts may not apply this immunity doctrine to all claims. There is also a risk that legislative or regulatory developments may change the application of this immunity doctrine. Limitations on the application of the immunity doctrine could result in an increased exposure to litigation, and increase liability and/or other legal expenses. Further under the Commodity Exchange Act, CFE and Cboe SEF may be subject to litigation alleging that they have acted in bad faith. We also could be exposed to liability to regulators or other governmental authorities even in situations where immunity would bar a civil claim.\nLegislative or regulatory changes affecting our markets could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nChanges in regulation by the SEC, CFTC, FCA, Central Bank of the Netherlands (“DNB”), AFM, IIROC, OSC, ASIC, JFSA, JSDA, other foreign regulators or other government action, including SEC approval of rule filings by other SROs or entities, including OCC, could materially affect our markets, products and clearinghouse. In recent years, the securities and derivatives industries have been subject to regulatory changes as a result of increasing government and public scrutiny of the securities and derivatives industries. We have also experienced, and we may also experience due to changes in administrations in the U.S. and expansion into other asset classes, such as the digital asset space or U.S. Treasuries and geographies, an increase in rulemaking and legislation that could affect our business.\nFurther, Congress, regulators and some media have been increasingly scrutinizing electronic trading, payment for order flow and other forms of remuneration, and the structure of equity markets in recent years. The SEC continues to consider various potential market structure changes, which could result in reduced trading volumes, or which could negatively affect our business. To the extent the SEC adopts regulatory changes, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted. In addition, high frequency trading has been the subject of private litigation and we are party to one such matter. See Note 23 (“Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees—Legal Proceedings”) for more information. To the extent the SEC adopts additional regulatory changes related to market data and access and capacity, our business, financial condition and operating results could be negatively impacted.\nUnder EU and UK regulations, European and UK banks and other European and UK financial institutions become subject to punitive capital charges if they transact options or futures through a third country central counterparty (“CCP”) that is not recognized in the applicable jurisdiction. OCC, our clearinghouse for U.S. options and futures, is not currently recognized as a third country CCP by the EU or the UK. However, the European Commission has issued equivalency determinations for CCPs regulated by the CFTC and SEC, which includes OCC, and OCC’s application for recognition as a third country CCP in the EU is pending. The UK has not issued any equivalency determination with respect to U.S. CCPs, and accordingly OCC has not yet submitted its application for recognition in the UK but is instead operating under the UK’s temporary recognition regime. As a prerequisite to ultimately achieving recognition in the EU or UK, it is possible that OCC could be required by the EU or UK to contribute capital to its default waterfall applicable in the event of clearing\n43\nmember default. This capital could be required to be drawn before the default fund contributions of non-defaulting clearing members in the event that a defaulting clearing member’s margin and other contributions were to be exhausted. OCC’s stockholders, including Cboe Options, could effectively be required to fund this capital. If the EU or UK do not recognize OCC as a third country CCP, then European or UK market participants that clear through OCC would become subject to punitive capital charges. As a result, we could experience the loss of a significant number of European or UK market participants and a significant reduction in trading activity on our options and futures markets, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR in Europe at the beginning of 2018 has encouraged competition among market centers in Europe. MiFID II and MiFIR have introduced a number of new rules, including enhanced internal organizational and compliance monitoring requirements, which apply directly to European trading venues such as our MTF and RM. The impact of MiFID II and MiFIR is significant, and the increased competition among market centers could reduce trading volumes and trading fees, while increasing our costs of operating in Europe. Additionally, European authorities are planning to continue to review MiFID in the second half of 2021 as a result of which new rules may come into effect that could have a material impact on our business.\nAs discussed above, in 2021 the E.C. and ESMA published proposals for the review of EU market structure, including provisions for a consolidated tape for the EU, changes to the transparency regime for equities, increased pre-trade transparency for periodic auctions, and post-trade flagging. These proposals are expected to be implemented from the middle of 2022 to late 2023 or early 2024. As proposed, these new rules may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe legislative and regulatory environment in which the spot FX market operates is evolving and has undergone significant changes in the recent past, and there may be future regulatory changes in the spot FX industry. The FX Global Code was published in 2017 and sets forth standards of conduct agreed by market participants and central banks on a global basis to apply to the wholesale FX market, and the effect of its publication on conduct and future regulation continues to evolve. Cboe FX issued a Statement of Commitment declaring its commitment to conduct its FX market activities in a manner consistent with the principles of the FX Global Code. Amendments to the FX Global Code, changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and regulations by applicable governmental bodies and regulatory organizations, or the adoption of new legal or regulatory requirements, may also adversely affect our spot FX business. Further, our FX NDF business may also be adversely affected by proposed regulatory changes to the rules governing swap execution facilities.\nIt is also possible that there will be additional legislative and regulatory changes or efforts in the environment in which we operate, or plan to operate, our businesses. Actions on any of the specific regulatory issues currently under review in the U.S. or internationally and other proposals could have a material impact on our business.\nIn addition, U.S. and foreign legislatures and regulators could impose legislative or regulatory changes that could materially adversely impact the ability of our market participants to use our markets or participate in the securities industry at all. Any such changes could result in the loss of a significant number of market participants or a reduction in trading activity on our markets, either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results. Changes or proposed changes in regulation may also result in additional costs of compliance and modification of market participants’ trading activity on our Exchanges and markets.\nAny infringement by us on intellectual property rights of others could result in litigation and could have a material adverse effect on our operations.\nOur competitors, as well as others, have obtained, or may obtain, patents or may otherwise hold intellectual property rights that are related to our technology or the types of products and services we offer or plan to offer. We may not be aware of all intellectual property that may pose a risk of infringement by our products, services or technologies. In addition, some potential patent applications in the U.S. are confidential until a patent is issued, and therefore we cannot evaluate the extent to which our products, services or technologies may be covered or asserted to be covered in pending patent applications. Thus, we cannot be sure that our products, services or technologies do not infringe on the rights of others or that others will not make claims of infringement against us. Claims of infringement are not uncommon in our industry, and even if we believe that such claims are without merit, they can be time-consuming and costly to defend and divert management resources and attention. If one or more of our products, services or technologies were determined to infringe a patent or other intellectual property right held by another party, we may be required to pay damages, stop using, developing or marketing those products, services or technologies, obtain a license from the intellectual property rights holders, or redesign those products, services or technologies to avoid infringement. If we were required to stop using,\n44\ndeveloping or marketing certain products, services or technologies, our business, financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed. Moreover, if we were unable to obtain required licenses, we may not be able to redesign our products, services or technologies to avoid infringement, which could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nMisconduct by our TPHs, members, participants or others could harm us.\nWe run the risk that our TPHs, members, participants, other persons who use our markets or our products, other persons for whom we clear transactions, our employees or those with which we have business relationships may engage in fraud, market or product manipulation, or other misconduct, which could result in regulatory and legal sanctions and penalties and serious harm to our reputation, especially because we are the parent company of SROs. It is not always possible to deter misconduct, or market or product manipulation, and the precautions we take to prevent and detect this activity may not be effective in all cases. In addition, misconduct, or market or product manipulation by, or failures of, participants on our or other exchanges may discourage trading on our Exchanges or of our products, which could reduce revenues.\nPotential conflicts of interest between our for-profit status and our regulatory responsibilities may adversely affect our business.\nAs a for-profit business with regulatory responsibilities, we are responsible for disciplining TPHs and members for violating our rules, including by imposing fines and sanctions. This may create a conflict of interest between our business interests and our regulatory responsibilities. Any failure by us to fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, increase regulatory scrutiny or cause the SEC or CFTC to take action against us, all of which could materially adversely affect our business, results of operations or financial condition.\nBIDS Trading’s ability to operate under its current regulatory framework is dependent upon the sufficiency of a novel operational and governance framework we have developed to govern our relationship with BIDS Trading and our ability to comply with such framework and if we fail to adhere to such framework or the BIDS Trading ATS is otherwise deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\n​\nThe U.S. equities ATS operated by BIDS Trading is regulated as a broker-dealer sponsored alternative trading system and not a registered national securities exchange. Because we acquired BIDS Trading, it is now under common ownership with our registered national securities exchanges that, in some cases, offer trading in the same securities as those traded on the BIDS Trading ATS. Absent sufficient separation, this common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities presents the potential for the BIDS Trading ATS to be deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. If the BIDS Trading ATS were to be deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, certain exchange regulations could be extended to the BIDS Trading ATS, which could have a material adverse impact on BIDS Trading’s business model. This could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us. This could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a “facility,” which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results\n.\n​\nTo mitigate the risk that the BIDS Trading ATS is deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, we have developed and implemented an operational and governance framework for our ownership of BIDS Trading that is intended to preserve the strategic, technological, business, and operational independence of the BIDS Trading ATS from our registered national securities exchange businesses, such that the BIDS Trading ATS and our registered national securities exchanges would not be deemed to be integrated or otherwise linked for “facility” purposes. This framework is supported by highly detailed policies, procedures and controls. However, because of the lack of precedent for common ownership of an ATS and registered national security exchanges offering trading in the same securities, there is risk that our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls could be deemed to be insufficient to prevent the BIDS Trading ATS from being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. In addition, because of the comprehensive and highly detailed nature of our framework and supporting policies, procedures and controls, there is risk that we could inadvertently fail to fully adhere to our operational and governance framework and related policies, procedures and controls. There is also risk that new legislation or regulation, or changes in existing regulation or other government action, relating to “facilities” of registered national securities exchanges and/or the common ownership of an ATS and registered national securities exchanges offering trading in the same securities could materially affect our ability to own and operate the BIDS Trading ATS under the current operational and governance framework, including without the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges. Occurrence of any of the\n45\nrisks described in this paragraph could result in the BIDS Trading ATS being deemed to be a “facility” of our registered national securities exchanges, which could reduce the BIDS Trading ATS’ competitiveness and volumes and could result in a reduction of the value of the BIDS Trading ATS to us, and could also potentially result in fines or other penalties being assessed against us for our failure to operate the BIDS Trading ATS as a “facility,” which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIf our risk management and compliance methods are not effective, our business, financial condition and operating results may be adversely affected.\nOur ability to comply with applicable laws and rules is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, risk, audit, and reporting systems and procedures, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance, risk and audit management personnel. These systems and procedures may not be fully effective. We face the risk of intervention by regulatory authorities, including extensive examination and surveillance activity. In the case of actual or alleged non-compliance with applicable laws or regulations, we could be subject to investigations and judicial or administrative proceedings that may result in penalties, settlements or civil lawsuits, including by customers, or third parties, for damages, which may be substantial. For example, the SEC has previously brought actions against exchange operators, including us, for failing to fulfill their obligations to have an effective regulatory system. Any failure to comply with applicable laws and rules could materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results and, in extreme cases, our ability to conduct our business or portions thereof. As the parent company for SROs, other markets, and a clearinghouse, we are responsible for maintaining markets that comply with securities and futures laws, SEC, FCA, AFM, DNB, IIROC, OSC, ASIC, JFSA, JSDA, ESMA, and CFTC regulations and the rules of the respective exchanges, markets and clearinghouse.\nWe have methods to identify, monitor and manage our risks. Management of legal, compliance, and regulatory risk, among other risks, requires policies and procedures to properly monitor and manage risk. If our policies, procedures, and compliance systems are not effective or we are not successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected. We cannot provide assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective, or that our management, compliance department, risk department and related enterprise risk management program and internal audit department would be able to identify any such ineffectiveness. If these departments or the enterprise risk program, and related policies and procedures are not effective, we may be subject to monetary or other penalties by our regulators, and our insurance policies may not provide adequate coverage.\nOur ability to implement or amend rules could be limited or delayed because of regulation, which could negatively affect our ability to implement needed changes.\nOur Exchanges registered with the SEC must submit proposed rule changes to the SEC for its review and, in many cases, its approval. Even where a proposed rule change may be effective upon filing with the SEC, the SEC retains the right to suspend and disapprove such a rule change. Also, the CFTC may stay or disapprove rules that we file with it for CFE or Cboe SEF. The rule review process can be lengthy and can significantly delay the implementation of proposed rule changes that we believe are necessary to the operation of our markets. If the SEC or CFTC delays, including because of a government shutdown, or does not allow one of our Exchanges to implement a rule change, this could negatively affect our ability to make needed changes or implement business activities.\nSimilarly, the SEC must approve amendments to our exchange subsidiaries’ certificates of incorporation and bylaws as well as certain amendments to the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of Cboe Global Markets. The SEC may decide not to approve a proposed amendment or may delay such approval in a manner that could negatively affect our ability to make a desired change, which could prevent or delay us from improving the operations of our markets or recognize income from new products.\nChanges in the tax laws and regulations affecting us, our products and our market participants could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nLegislation may be proposed, both domestically and internationally, that could add a transaction tax on our products or change the way that our market participants are taxed on the products they trade on our markets. More recently, a number of federal, state and local jurisdictions in the U.S. and EU Member States have considered a financial transaction tax, but many details remain to be discussed and agreed, including how to assess the tax. Additionally, the proposed Modernization of Derivatives Tax Act of 2021 would introduce in the U.S. mark-to-market tax treatment for all derivatives contracts and require gains and losses be taxed at ordinary income tax rates. If such proposals were to become law, they\n46\ncould have a negative impact on the securities industry and on us by making transactions more costly to market participants, which may impact derivatives trading behavior, reduce trading or clearing and could make our markets less competitive, and they could result in a reduction in volumes and liquidity, which would have a negative impact on our operations.\nIn addition to proposed tax changes that could affect our market participants, like other corporations, we are subject to taxes at federal, state and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies or successful claims by tax authorities could result in our having to pay higher taxes, which would in turn reduce our net income. If this occurs, we may experience a higher effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to litigation risks and other liabilities.\nMany aspects of our business involve substantial risks of litigation and other liabilities. Although under current law we expect to be immune from private suits arising from conduct within our regulatory authority and from acts and forbearances incident to the exercise of our regulatory authority, we expect this immunity will only cover certain of our activities in the U.S., and we could be exposed to liability under foreign, national and local laws, court decisions and rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies.\nSome of our other liability risks arise under the laws and regulations relating to the tax, employment, intellectual property, anti-money laundering, technology export, cybersecurity, foreign asset controls, foreign corrupt practices, employee labor and employment areas, including anti-discrimination and fair-pay laws and regulations. Liability could also result from disputes over the terms of a trade executed on one of our markets, claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, claims we entered into an unauthorized transaction or claims that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a transaction.\nFor example, we are subject to on-going legal disputes that could result in the payment of fines, penalties or damages and could expose us to additional liability in the future. See Item 3 “Legal Proceedings” in this Annual Report for a general description of our legal proceedings and claims and Note 23 (“Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees – Legal Proceedings”) to the consolidated financial statements and related notes, which are included elsewhere in this Annual Report, for a summary of specific legal proceedings.\nFurther, we could incur significant expenses vigorously defending the claims mentioned above (including those found to be barred due to immunity) and any future claims, even those without merit, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. The outcomes of existing claims and any future claims cannot be determined and an adverse resolution of any lawsuit or claim against us may require us to pay substantial damages or impose restrictions on how we conduct business, either of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results. In addition, we may have to establish accruals for those matters in circumstances when a loss contingency is considered probable and the related amount is reasonably estimable. Any such accruals may be adjusted as circumstances change.\nRisks Related to Our Common Stock and Indebtedness\nWe have outstanding indebtedness, which may decrease our business flexibility and adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $159.5 million outstanding under our term loan facility, $646.5 million of senior unsecured notes due 2027, $493.3 million of senior unsecured notes due 2030, no funds outstanding under our revolving credit facility and no funds outstanding under the EuroCCP credit facility. The financial and other covenants to which we have agreed and our indebtedness may have the effect of reducing our flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions, thereby placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to competitors that have less indebtedness and making us more vulnerable to general adverse economic and industry conditions. Further, we may default on our obligations or violate the covenants, in which case, we may be required to seek a waiver of such default or the debt obligations may be accelerated. A default under any of our indebtedness with cross default provisions could result in a default on our other indebtedness. Our indebtedness may also increase future borrowing costs, and the covenants pertaining thereto may also limit our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock, increase dividends or obtain additional financing to fund working capital, capital expenditures, acquisitions or general corporate requirements. We are also required to dedicate a larger portion of our cash flow from operations to payments on our indebtedness, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow for other purposes, including working capital, capital expenditures and\n47\ngeneral corporate purposes. Further, a portion of our borrowings are at variable rates of interest, which exposes us to the risk of increased interest rates unless we enter into offsetting hedging transactions.\nOur ability to make payments on and to refinance our debt obligations and to fund planned capital expenditures depend on our ability to generate cash from our operations. This, to a certain extent, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control.\nWe may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. If we cannot service our indebtedness, we may have to take actions such as selling assets, seeking additional equity or reducing or delaying capital expenditures, strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances, any of which could impede the implementation of our business strategy or prevent us from entering into transactions that would otherwise benefit our business. Additionally, we may not be able to affect such actions, if necessary, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Any of the foregoing consequences could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nDeterioration in our credit profile may increase our costs of borrowing money.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have investment grade credit ratings from S&P Global Ratings (A-) and Moody’s Investor Service (A3). Ratings from credit agencies are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold our securities, and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating. There is no assurance that we will maintain such credit ratings, since credit ratings may be lowered or withdrawn entirely by a rating agency if, in its judgment, the circumstances warrant. If a rating agency were to downgrade our rating below investment grade, our borrowing costs could increase.\nIf our goodwill, long-lived assets, investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets become impaired, the resulting charge to earnings may be significant.\nWe are required to assess investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries and intangible assets for impairment at least annually. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired. In the future, we may take charges against earnings resulting from impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of our goodwill, long-lived assets, intangible assets or investments in non-consolidated subsidiaries could materially adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon the earnings and cash flow of our operating subsidiaries. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay dividends to our stockholders.\nAny decision to pay dividends on our common stock in the future will be at the discretion of our Board of Directors, which may determine not to declare dividends at all or at a reduced amount. The board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and the SEC and other factors that the board deems relevant. As a holding company with no significant business operations of its own, Cboe Global Markets depends entirely on distributions, if any, it may receive from its subsidiaries to meet its obligations and pay dividends to its stockholders. If these subsidiaries are not profitable, or even if they are and they determine to retain their profits for use in their businesses, we will be unable to pay dividends to our stockholders.\nCertain provisions in our organizational documents and governing law could prevent or delay a change of control.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that could block actions that stockholders might find favorable, including discouraging, delaying or preventing a change of control or any unsolicited acquisition proposals for us. These include provisions:\n​\n​\n48\nIn addition, our organizational documents include provisions that:\n​\nFurthermore, our Board of Directors has the authority to issue shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights and preferences of these shares without stockholder approval. Any series of our preferred stock is likely to be senior to our common stock with respect to dividends, liquidation rights and, possibly, voting rights. The ability of the Board of Directors to issue preferred stock also could have the effect of discouraging unsolicited acquisition proposals, thus materially adversely affecting the market price of our common stock.\nDelaware law makes it difficult for stockholders that have recently acquired a large interest in a corporation to cause the merger or acquisition of the corporation against the board’s wishes. Under Section 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law, a Delaware corporation may not engage in any merger or other business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder except in limited circumstances, including by approval of the corporation’s Board of Directors.\nFurthermore, the European countries where we operate regulated entities, such as the UK and Netherlands, may require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10% or more of the outstanding shares of our common stock.\nRisks Relating to Our Business Following Consummation of Pending ErisX Acquisition\nWe may not realize the expected benefits of our pending acquisition of ErisX and the acquisition introduces additional risks to our business due to its evolving business model.\nWe expect to acquire ErisX, a U.S.-based digital asset spot market, a regulated futures exchange and a regulated clearinghouse, which we plan to rebrand as Cboe Digital following close. This planned acquisition is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Leveraging digital asset data from ErisX’s and our existing index calculation capabilities, we intend to develop and distribute digital asset indices for potential use in exchange traded products and other derivative product opportunities. We also plan to develop a robust market data offering based on actionable bid and offer prices from the ErisX spot crypto market, and ultimately intend to develop a benchmark to help ErisX’s industry partners and other market participants evaluate the appropriateness of crypto execution prices and offer digital asset trading to their clients. We expect to have increased financial and reputational risks if there is a failure to develop and launch one or more of anticipated products resulting from this potential acquisition, or if the development or launch of a new product is unsuccessful. Also, there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the necessary regulatory approvals or receive support from market participants, industry partners and users to develop and launch products as planned, that ErisX will continue to operate as anticipated, or that we will realize the expected return on our investment. Furthermore, our potential investment in ErisX entails numerous risks, including risks relating to our ability to:\nIn addition, we expect that certain market participants intend to acquire minority ownership interests in Cboe Digital and to serve as partners in the growth of the business. If these market participants do not acquire minority ownership interests or serve as partners in the growth of the business, then we may not be able to realize the expected return on our investment.  Insufficient participation from market participants in ownership and partnership may adversely affect the ability of ErisX to operate as anticipated or grow, which may have a material adverse effect on our business following the acquisition.\nAs digital assets technologies evolve, once under our management, ErisX may add, modify or discontinue certain aspects of its business model relating to the product mix and service offerings. Future additions and modifications to ErisX’s business will increase the complexity of its business and may place significant strain on ErisX’s management, personnel, operations, systems, technical performance, financial resources and internal financial control and reporting\n49\nfunctions. We cannot offer any assurance that these or any other additions or modifications will be successful or will not result in harm to our business following the acquisition.\nAdditionally, sources of ErisX revenue are dependent on digital assets and the broader blockchain ecosystem. Due to the highly volatile nature of the blockchain ecosystem and the prices of digital assets, ErisX’s operating results have fluctuated, and may continue to fluctuate, significantly from period to period in accordance with market sentiments and movements in the broader blockchain ecosystem.\nAdditionally, the blockchain ecosystem is highly innovative, rapidly evolving and characterized by intense competition, experimentation and frequent introductions of new products and services, and is subject to uncertain and evolving industry and regulatory requirements. We expect competition to increase in the future as existing and new competitors introduce new products or enhance existing products that may compete with ErisX. We have limited experience in the digital assets space, and ErisX has limited experience applying its digital platform to a global exchange and clearing infrastructure for digital assets. The creation and operation of a global cryptocurrency spot and derivatives trading market is subject to potential technical, legal and regulatory constraints. Any problems that we encounter with the operation of the ErisX systems, including technical, legal and regulatory problems, could negatively impact our business and plan of operations following the acquisition.\nErisX may be unsuccessful in retaining its key personnel.\nThe success of ErisX will depend in part on the ability to retain its key employees, while the acquisition is pending and following our acquisition of ErisX. If ErisX is unable to retain key employees, including management, who are critical to the successful integration and future operations, we and ErisX could face disruptions in our respective operations, loss of customers, loss of key information, expertise or know-how and unanticipated additional recruitment costs. In addition, if key employees terminate their employment, ErisX’s business activities may be adversely affected and management’s attention may be diverted from successfully integrating ErisX to hiring suitable replacements, all of which may cause ErisX’s business to suffer. In addition, hiring qualified and experienced personnel in this specialized technology space is difficult due to the high level of competition and scarcity of experience. We and ErisX may have difficulty finding, hiring and integrating qualified employees to fill positions following the acquisition.\nThe characteristics of digital assets and digital asset platforms have been, and may in the future continue to be, exploited to facilitate illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, ransomware scams and other types of cybercrime, as well as other technical issues, which could adversely affect ErisX.\nDigital assets and the digital asset industry are relatively new and, in many cases, lightly regulated or largely unregulated. Digital asset platforms on which digital assets trade pose special risks, as these platforms are generally new and the rules governing their activities are unsettled and their activities may be largely unregulated, and may therefore be more exposed to theft, fraud, and failure than established, regulated exchanges for other products.\nSome types of digital assets, particularly cryptocurrencies, have characteristics, such as the speed with which transactions can be conducted, the ability to conduct transactions without the involvement of regulated intermediaries, the ability to engage in transactions across multiple jurisdictions, the irreversible nature of certain transactions and encryption technology that anonymizes these transactions, that make those assets potentially susceptible to use in illegal activity such as fraud, money laundering, tax evasion, ransomware scams and other types of cybercrime. Digital asset platforms have been shut down or experienced losses of assets placed on the platform as a result of cybercrime, and any such event is likely to result in the complete loss of assets placed on such a platform. Any governmental or regulatory action against such a digital asset trading platform may cause assets on such platform to become frozen for a substantial period of time or forfeited, and could result in material opportunity costs or even in the total loss of such assets. In addition, banks may refuse to process or support wire transfers to or from digital asset trading platforms.\nWhile we believe that ErisX’s risk management and compliance framework is reasonably designed to detect any such illicit activities, we cannot ensure that we and ErisX will be able to detect such illegal activity in all instances. Because the speed, irreversibility and anonymity of certain digital asset transactions potentially makes them difficult to track, fraudulent transactions may be more likely to occur. ErisX may be specifically targeted by individuals seeking to conduct transfers for fraudulent purposes, and it may be difficult or impossible for us and ErisX to detect and avoid such transactions in certain circumstances.\nVarious other technical issues with blockchain networks have also been uncovered from time to time that resulted in disabled functionality, exposure of certain users’ personal data, theft of users’ assets, and other negative consequences, and which required resolution with the attention and efforts of their global miner, user and development communities. If any\n50\nsuch risks or other risks materialize, the development and growth of digital assets may be significantly affected and, as a result, ErisX’s business, operating results and financial condition could be adversely affected.\nThe acquisition of ErisX may increase regulatory costs and risks, and there can be no assurance that our or ErisX’s employees or agents will not violate applicable laws and regulations.\nVarious aspects of the business that ErisX is engaging in, or planning to engage in, are heavily regulated. ErisX's futures exchange and clearinghouse are regulated by the CFTC, and ErisX's clearinghouse is registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network and is licensed as a money transmitter in many U.S. states and territories. The trading, clearance, and settlement of digital asset transactions may be subject to the federal securities laws and regulated by the SEC if the asset is considered a security. We and ErisX are also subject to federal and state anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing laws and regulations.\nWe and ErisX currently maintain policies and procedures designed to reasonably help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our or ErisX’s employees or agents will not violate such laws and regulations. A failure by us or ErisX, including the respective employees or agents, to comply with such laws and regulations and subsequent judgment or settlement against us or ErisX under these laws could subject us or ErisX to monetary penalties, damages, and/or have a significant reputational impact.\nRegulatory or other legislative changes or actions may restrict the use of digital assets in a manner that adversely affects ErisX’s business, prospects or operations and, consequently, our potential investment in ErisX.\nRegulatory or other legislative changes or actions may impact the ability of ErisX to continue to operate, and such actions could affect the ability of ErisX to continue as a going concern. The regulatory and legislative framework is unsettled with respect to many forms of digital assets, which means that federal or state regulators or legislators may in the future curtail or prohibit the acquisition, use or redemption of certain digital assets. Ownership of, holding or trading in certain digital assets may become subject to sanction. Federal or state regulators or legislators may also take regulatory or legislative action that may increase the cost and/or subject companies to additional regulations and laws regarding custody or facilitating the trading of digital assets.\nIn addition, as ErisX expands its business to new products and services, it will come under the jurisdiction of additional regulators - both with respect to jurisdiction and subject matter. Any failure or perceived failure to comply with existing or new laws, regulations, or orders of any governmental authority (including changes to or expansion of the interpretation of those laws, regulations, or orders), including those discussed in this risk factor, may subject us and ErisX to significant fines, penalties, criminal and civil lawsuits, forfeiture of significant assets, and enforcement, result in additional compliance and licensure requirements, increase regulatory scrutiny of its business, restrict ErisX’s operations, and force ErisX to change its business practices, make product or operational changes, or delay planned product launches or improvements. We and ErisX currently maintain policies and procedures designed to reasonably help ensure compliance with applicable laws and regulations, but there can be no assurance that our or ErisX’s employees, contractors, or agents will not violate such laws and regulations.\nDigital asset custodial solutions and related technology, including ErisX’s systems and custodial arrangements, are subject to risks related to a loss of funds due to theft of digital assets, employee or vendor sabotage, security and cybersecurity risks, system failures and other operational issues which could cause damage to our and ErisX’s reputation and brand.\nThe secure storage and transmission of digital assets and data over networks is a critical element of ErisX’s operations. Threats to ErisX’s storage and transmission of digital assets and data may come from external factors such as governments, organized crime, hackers and other third parties such as outsourced or infrastructure-support providers and application developers, or may originate internally from an employee or service provider to whom ErisX has granted access to its systems.\nDigital asset transactions may be irrevocable, and stolen or incorrectly transferred digital assets may be irretrievable. Once a transaction has been verified and recorded in a block that is added to the blockchain, an incorrect transfer of a digital asset generally will not be reversible, and ErisX may not be capable of seeking compensation for any such transfer or theft. It is possible that, through computer or human error, or through theft or criminal action, the digital asset could be transferred in incorrect amounts or to unauthorized third parties, or to uncontrolled accounts. Such events would have a material adverse effect on the ability of ErisX to continue as a going concern, which may have an adverse effect on our business following the acquisition.\n51\nWhile we and ErisX maintain cybersecurity procedures and policies, those procedures and policies may not be adequate to avoid the potential losses caused by security breaches, and ErisX may lose digital assets without any recourse. Unlike bank accounts or accounts at some other financial institutions, in the event of loss or loss of utility value, there is no public insurer, such as the Securities Investor Protection Corporation or the FDIC, to offer recourse to us, ErisX, or to any investor and the misappropriated digital assets may not easily be traced to the bad actor.\nFurther, when cryptocurrency custodial solutions (whether involving ErisX systems or others) experience system failures or other operational issues, such events could result in a reduction in cryptocurrency prices or confidence and impact the success of ErisX and have a material adverse effect on the ability of ErisX to continue as a going concern, which may have an adverse effect on our business following the acquisition.\nErisX’s clearinghouse operations are exposed to risks, including credit, liquidity, market and other risks related to the potential defaults of clearing members and other counterparties.\nErisX is subject to risks related to operating its clearinghouse, Eris Clearing, which is a derivatives clearing organization (“DCO”), registered with the CFTC. Risks associated with the operation of Eris Clearing include failing to meet strict business continuity requirements and regulatory oversight, risks of default by clearing members and counterparties due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons, and the risks associated with the adequacy of participants’ margin and guaranty funds. There is no guarantee the collateral deposited will continue to maintain its value, and the use of digital assets as collateral may introduce additional volatility in value. Please also refer to the risk factors above for a discussion of other risks associated with the use of digital assets. These risks could subject ErisX to substantial losses, reputational harm, regulatory consequences, including litigation, fines and enforcement actions, and the inability to operate its business."

The contemplated new NMS Plan is referred to as the “CT Plan” and it will replace three Equity Data Plans that govern the dissemination of real-time, consolidated market data for NMS stocks. The Consolidated Data Plan Order set forth certain changes to be included in the proposed CT Plan, including governance structure changes related to voting rights and a deadline of August 11, 2020 by which the proposed CT Plan had to be filed.\n​\nOn June 29, 2020, the Company filed a Petition for Review (“PFR”) with the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit Court (“D.C. Circuit) challenging the Consolidated Data Plan Order. Briefing concluded on March 12, 2021 and oral argument was held on April 26, 2021. On June 15, 2021, the D.C. Circuit issued an order dismissing the PFR for lack of jurisdiction, holding that the Consolidated Data Plan Order was not a “final order” because the SEC had not determined whether the challenged features would make it into the new CT Plan.\n​\nOn August 6, 2021, the SEC issued an order approving the CT Plan that was previously filed on August 11, 2020 (as mandated by the Consolidated Data Plan Order) and subject to public comment (“CT Plan Order”). On August 9, 2021, the Company filed another PFR with the D.C. Circuit challenging the CT Plan Order and the prior Consolidated Data Plan Order. On September 13, 2021, the Company filed a motion requesting that the D.C. Circuit stay the CT Plan Order pending resolution of the appeal and also requesting that the D.C. Circuit expedite the appeal. On October 13, 2021, the D.C. Circuit granted the motion to stay the CT Plan order and to expedite the appeal and established a briefing schedule. Briefing concluded in January 2022 and oral argument is scheduled for March 24, 2022.\n​\nThe new CT Plan approved by the SEC may cause the Company’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or challenge such new consolidated data plan and it may have a material impact on our business, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there is a negative impact on the applicable market data revenues that we receive that are generated from such new plan.\n​\nMarket Data Infrastructure Final Rule\n​\nOn December 9, 2020, the SEC issued a Market Data Infrastructure Final Rule (“Final Rule”), which makes significant additions to the content available on the Securities Information Processors (“SIPs”) and replaces the exclusive processors with a competing consolidator model. The Final Rule is limited to market data disseminated by the equities SIPs and does not apply to proprietary market data, or the dissemination of options market data through OPRA.\n​\nOn February 5, 2021, the Company filed a Petition for Review (the “2/5 PFR”) with the Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit challenging the Final Order. Additionally, on February 5, 2021, the Company filed a motion for stay of the Final Rule with the SEC, which the SEC denied on March 24, 2021.\n​\nOn March 24, 2021, the SEC filed a Motion to Dismiss (“MTD”) with the D.C. Circuit: (1) arguing that the PFR is not ripe because the Final Rule had not been published in the Federal Register (“FR”), (2) suggesting (if there is ambiguity) that the D.C. Circuit clarify whether publication in the FR opens the filing window, and (3) suggesting that the D.C. Circuit could hold the case in abeyance pending filing of a PFR after publication in the FR.\n​\nOn April 9, 2021, the Final Rule was published in the FR. On April 13, 2021, the Company filed another PFR (the “4/ PFR””) as a protective measure in the event the D.C. Circuit determined that the time to file a PFR does not commence until publication of the Final Rule in the FR.\n​\nOn June 15, 2021, the D.C. Circuit entered an order granting the SEC’s MTD respecting the 2/5 PFR. This order does not affect the 4/13 PFR, which was filed after publication of the Final Rule in the FR on April 9, 2021. On July 9, 2021, the D.C. Circuit entered a briefing schedule, which concluded in January 2022. Oral argument is scheduled for March 18, 2022.\n​\nThe implementation of the Final Rule could cause Cboe’s equities exchanges, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, to require additional resources to comply with or to challenge the new rules and they may have a material impact on our\n54\nbusiness, financial condition and operating results if, for example, there are lower SIP plan revenues or we must reduce the fees we charge for market data.

As of January 31, 2022, there were approximately 123 holders of record of our common stock.\nDividends\nEach share of common stock, including restricted stock awards and restricted stock units, is entitled to receive dividend and dividend equivalents, respectively, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the Company.\nThe Company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant. Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, our ability to pay dividends.\nAs a holding company, the Company’s ability to declare and continue to pay dividends in the future with respect to its common stock will also be dependent upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to it under applicable corporate law.\nRecent Sales of Unregistered Securities\nNot applicable.\nUse of Proceeds\nNot applicable.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer and Affiliated Purchasers\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2011, the Board of Directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of $100 million and approved additional authorizations of $100 million in each of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, $250 million in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, and $200 million in February 2021, for a total authorization of $1.6 billion. The program permits the Company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws.

The following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the Company and the notes thereto included in Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following discussion contains forward-looking statements. Actual results could differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. See\n“\nRisk Factors\n”\nand\n“\nForward-Looking Statements\n”\nabove.\nA detailed comparison of the Company’s 2020 operating results to its 2019 operating results can be found in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations section in the Company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed February 19, 2021 at\nwww.sec.gov\n.\nINTRODUCTION\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations is organized as follows:\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nOverview\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. (“Cboe” or “the Company”), a leading provider of market infrastructure and tradable products, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to market participants around the world. The Company is committed to operating a trusted, inclusive global marketplace, providing leading products, technology and data solutions that enable participants to define a sustainable financial future. Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest stock exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates one of the largest stock exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns EuroCCP, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Trading, a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., MATCHNow, a leading equities ATS in Canada, and Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, and Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan. Cboe also is a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading.\nThe Company is headquartered in Chicago with offices in Amsterdam, Belfast, Calgary, Hong Kong, Kansas City, London, Manila, New York, San Francisco, Sarasota Springs, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Toronto.\n58\nRecent Developments\nAcquisition of BIDS Holdings\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of BIDS Holdings, which is included in the Company’s North American Equities segment. BIDS Holdings owns BIDS Trading, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS ATS, the largest block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S. The BIDS ATS is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof. The acquisition follows Cboe and BIDS Trading’s successful partnership in Europe, which began in 2016 with the creation of Cboe LIS for European equities block-trading. Since its launch, Cboe LIS has grown to become one of the largest block-trading platforms in Europe. BIDS Trading’s proven block-trading capability provides the Company a foothold in the off-exchange segment of the U.S. equities market. Additionally, BIDS Trading’s differentiated network of global buy-side investment managers and sell-side constituents provides the foundation for Cboe to potentially build more off-exchange products and services in non-U.S. equities or options products and in geographies beyond the U.S.\nAcquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific Holdings, Ltd., a holding company of alternative market operators and providers of innovative market solutions. This acquisition provides the Company with a single point of entry into two key capital markets, Australia and Japan, helps enable it to expand its global equities and market data business into the Asia Pacific region, bring other products and services to the region, and further expand access to its unique proprietary product suite in the region. The transaction closed on July 1, 2021 based upon the time zone of both the acquiree, Chi-X Asia Pacific, and the acquiror, Cboe Worldwide Holdings Limited, a subsidiary of the Company.\nInvestment in Trading Technologies\nOn October 31, 2021, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, became a limited partner of 7Ridge Investments 3 LP (“7Ridge Fund”) in connection with 7Ridge Fund’s planned acquisition of Trading Technologies International, Inc. (“Trading Technologies”). On December 13, 2021, the Company’s subsidiary provided its financial commitment to 7Ridge Fund, and on December 21, 2021, 7Ridge Fund completed the acquisition of Trading Technologies. Trading Technologies is a global provider of next-generation professional trading software, connectivity and data solutions. The Company is strategically aligned with Trading Technologies’ vision of delivering a leading trading, connectivity and data network to the global trading community.\nPlanned acquisition of ErisX\nOn October 20, 2021, the Company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Eris Digital Holdings, LLC (“ErisX”). ErisX operates a U.S.-based digital asset spot market, a regulated futures exchange and a regulated clearinghouse. Ownership of ErisX presents a unique opportunity for the Company to enter the digital asset spot and derivatives marketplaces through a digital-first platform developed with industry partners to focus on robust regulatory compliance, data and transparency. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022; subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.\nPlanned acquisition of NEO\nOn November 15, 2021, the Company announced it entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Aequitas Innovations, Inc. (“NEO”). NEO is a fintech organization that is comprised of a fully registered Tier-1 Canadian securities exchange with a diverse product and services set ranging from corporate listings to cash equity trading. Ownership of NEO will help allow the Company to provide a more fulsome Canadian equities offering, operating the NEO Exchange, a national securities exchange with trading, listings, and other services, in addition to MATCHNow, the ATS acquired by the Company in 2020. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022; subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions.\nBusiness Segments\nThe Company reports five business segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, and Global FX. Segment performance is primarily based on operating income (loss). The Company has aggregated all of its corporate costs and eliminations, as well as other business ventures, within Corporate Items and Eliminations;\n59\nhowever, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment. Our management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages our business according to these segments:\nOptions.\nThe Options segment includes options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”), and options on ETPs, such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options are eligible to trade on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and other U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, and access and capacity services.\nNorth American Equities.\nThe North American Equities segment includes listed U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform, and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through the MATCHNow ATS. The North American Equities segment also includes ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.\nEurope and Asia Pacific.\nThe Europe and Asia Pacific segment includes the pan-European listed equities and derivatives transaction services, ETPs, exchange-traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities (Cboe Europe and Cboe NL) and Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of EuroCCP, as well as the equities transaction services of Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan, each operators of trading venues in Australia and Japan. This segment was previously referred to as the European Equities segment but was updated to the Europe segment in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives, a pan-European derivatives platform in September 2021. The segment was subsequently updated to Europe and Asia Pacific to reflect the acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific in July 2021. Cboe Europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, and a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility for UK symbols. Cboe NL, launched in October 2019 and based in Amsterdam, operates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe, and provides for trading only in European Economic Area (“EEA”) symbols. The new Cboe Europe Derivatives venue offers futures and options based on Cboe Europe equity indices. This segment also includes Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, CEDX, Cboe Australia, and Cboe Japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nFutures.\nThe Futures segment includes transaction services provided by the Company’s fully electronic futures exchange, CFE, which includes offerings for trading of VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services.\nGlobal FX.\nThe Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF and Cboe Swiss, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nGeneral Factors Affecting Results of Operations\nIn broad terms, our business performance is impacted by a number of drivers, including macroeconomic events affecting the risk and return of financial assets, investor sentiment, the regulatory environment for capital markets, geopolitical events, tax policies, central bank policies and changing technology, particularly in the financial services industry. We believe our future revenues and net income will continue to be influenced by a number of domestic and international economic trends, including:\n​\n60\nA number of significant structural, political and monetary issues and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to confront the global economy, and instability could continue, resulting in an increased or subdued level of inflation, market volatility, supply chain constraints, changes in trading volumes and greater uncertainty. Inflationary increases in our expenses, such as compensation inflation, may have an adverse effect on our financial results.\nWe continue to closely monitor developments around COVID-19 and follow guidance provided by governmental and public health agencies. In response to COVID-19, we have provided frequent communications to employees, customers, regulators, critical vendors, technology equipment suppliers, data and disaster recovery centers, and other service providers and instructed non-essential employees to work from home on a temporary basis, implemented travel restrictions, and temporarily suspended open outcry trading between March 13, 2020 and June 14, 2020, without any known significant disruptions to our business or control processes. We expect to continue to take further actions as necessary in response to addressing COVID-19. Our business and operations could be materially and adversely affected by the effects of COVID-19, however, the extent to which our results could be affected by COVID-19 largely depends on future developments which cannot be accurately predicted and are uncertain. Further, changes in trading behavior, additional suspensions of open outcry trading, market disruptions and other future developments caused by the effects of COVID-19 could impact trading volumes and the demand for our products, market data, and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results and cash flows for fiscal year 2021 and could be material during any future period impacted either directly or indirectly by this pandemic.\nComponents of Revenues\nTransaction and Clearing Fees\nTransaction fees represent fees charged by the Company for the performance obligation of executing a trade on its markets. These fees can be variable based on trade volume tiered discounts; however, as all tiered discounts are calculated monthly, the actual discount is recorded on a monthly basis. Transaction fees are recognized across all segments. Clearing fees, which include settlement fees, are charged by the Company for transactions cleared and settled by EuroCCP. Clearing fees can be variable based on trade volume tiered discounts; however, as all tiered discounts are calculated monthly, the actual discount is recorded on a monthly basis. Clearing fees are recognized in the Europe and Asia Pacific segment. Transaction and clearing fees, as well as any tiered volume discounts, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with the Company’s published fee schedules.\nAccess and Capacity Fees\nAccess and capacity fees represent fees assessed for the opportunity to trade, including fees for trading-related functionality across all segments, terminal and other equipment rights, maintenance services, trading floor space and telecommunications services. Facilities, systems services and other fees are generally monthly fee-based. These fees are billed monthly in accordance with the Company’s published fee schedules and recognized on a monthly basis when the performance obligation is met. All access and capacity fees associated with the trading floor are recognized in the Options segment. There is no remaining performance obligation after revenue is recognized.\nMarket Data Fees\nMarket data fees represent the fees from the U.S. tape plans and fees from customers for proprietary market data. Fees from the U.S. tape plans are collected monthly based on published fee schedules and distributed quarterly to the Exchanges based on a known formula using trading and/or quoting activity. A contract for proprietary market data is entered into and charged on a monthly basis in accordance with the Company’s published fee schedules as the service is provided. Both types of market data are satisfied over time, and revenue is recognized on a monthly basis as the customer receives and consumes the benefit as the Company provides the data. U.S. tape plan market data is\n61\nrecognized in the North American Equities and Options segments. Proprietary market data fees are recognized across all segments.\nRegulatory Fees\nRegulatory fees primarily represent fees collected by the Company to cover the Section 31 fees charged to the Exchanges under the authority of the SEC (Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA) and are charged by the SEC. Consistent with industry practice, the fees charged to customers are based on the fee set by the SEC per notional value of U.S. Equities exchange transactions and per round turn of Options transactions executed on the Company’s U.S. securities markets. These fees are calculated and billed monthly and are recognized in the North American Equities and Options segments. As the Exchanges are responsible for the ultimate payment to the SEC, the Exchanges are considered the principals in these transactions. Regulatory fees also include the options regulatory fee (“ORF”) which supports the Company’s regulatory oversight function in the Options segment, along with other miscellaneous regulatory fees, and neither can be used for non-regulatory purposes. The ORF and miscellaneous fees are recognized when the performance obligation is fulfilled.\nOther Revenue\nOther revenue primarily consists of revenue from various licensing agreements, interest income from clearing operations, all fees related to the trade reporting facility operated in the Europe and Asia Pacific segment, and listing fees.\nComponents of Cost of Revenues\nLiquidity Payments\nLiquidity payments are directly correlated to the volume of securities traded on our markets. As stated above, we record the liquidity rebates paid to market participants providing liquidity, in the case of C2, BZX, EDGX, and Cboe Europe, as cost of revenue. BYX and EDGA offer a pricing model where we rebate liquidity takers for executing against an order resting on our book, which is also recorded as a cost of revenues.\nRouting and Clearing\nVarious rules require that U.S. options and equities trade executions occur at the NBBO displayed by any exchange. Linkage order routing consists of the cost incurred to provide a service whereby Cboe equities and options exchanges deliver orders to other execution venues when there is a potential for obtaining a better execution price or when instructed to directly route an order to another venue by the order provider. The service affords exchange order flow providers an opportunity to obtain the best available execution price and may also result in cost benefits to those clients. Such an offering improves our competitive position and provides an opportunity to attract orders which would otherwise bypass our exchanges. We utilize third-party brokers or our broker-dealer, Cboe Trading, to facilitate such delivery. Also included within routing and clearing are the Order Management System and Execution Management System (“OMS” and “EMS”, respectively) fees incurred for U.S. Equities Off-Exchange order execution, as well as settlement costs incurred for the settlement process executed by EuroCCP.\nSection 31 Fees\nExchanges under the authority of the SEC (Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA) are assessed fees pursuant to the Exchange Act designed to recover the costs to the U.S. government of supervision and regulation of securities markets and securities professionals. We treat these fees as a pass-through charge to customers executing eligible listed equities and listed equity options trades. Accordingly, we recognize the amount that we are charged under Section 31 as a cost of revenues and the corresponding amount that we charge our customers as regulatory transaction fees revenue. Since the regulatory transaction fees recorded in revenues are equal to the Section 31 fees recorded in cost of revenues, there is no impact on our operating income. CFE, Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, BIDS, MATCHNow, Cboe FX, Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan are not U.S. national securities exchanges, and accordingly are not charged Section 31 fees.\n62\nRoyalty Fees\nRoyalty fees primarily consist of license fees paid by us for the use of underlying indices in our proprietary products usually based on contracts traded. The Company has licenses with the owners of the S&P 500 Index, S&P 100 Index and certain other S&P indices, FTSE Russell indices, the DJIA, MSCI, and certain other index products. This category also includes fees related to the dissemination of market data related to S&P indices and other products through Cboe Streaming Market Indices (“CSMI”).\nOther Cost of Revenues\nOther cost of revenues primarily consists of interest expense from clearing operations, electronic access permit fees and other miscellaneous costs associated with other revenue.\nComponents of Operating Expenses\nCompensation and Benefits\nCompensation and benefits represent our largest expense category and tend to be driven by our staffing requirements, financial performance, and the general dynamics of the employment market. Stock-based compensation is a non-cash expense related to equity awards. Stock-based compensation can vary depending on the quantity and fair value of the award on the date of grant and the related service period.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense results from the depreciation of long-lived assets purchased, the amortization of purchased and internally developed software, and the amortization of intangible assets.\nTechnology Support Services\nTechnology support services consists primarily of costs related to the maintenance of computer equipment supporting our system architecture, circuits supporting our wide area network, support for production software, operating system license and support fees, fees paid to information vendors for displaying data and off-site system hosting fees.\nProfessional Fees and Outside Services\nProfessional fees and outside services consist primarily of consulting services, which include supplemental staff activities primarily related to systems development and maintenance, legal, regulatory and audit, and tax advisory services.\nTravel and Promotional Expenses\nTravel and promotional expenses primarily consist of advertising, costs for special events, sponsorship of industry conferences, options education seminars and travel-related expenses.\nFacilities Costs\nFacilities costs primarily consist of expenses related to owned and leased properties including rent, maintenance, utilities, real estate taxes and telecommunications costs.\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs relate to acquisitions and other strategic opportunities, including the Merger. The acquisition-related costs include fees for investment banking advisors, lawyers, accountants, tax advisors, public relations firms, severance and retention costs, impairment of goodwill, capitalized software and facilities, and other external costs directly related to the mergers and acquisitions.\n63\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses represent costs necessary to support our operations that are not already included in the above categories.\nNon-Operating (Expenses) Income\nIncome and expenses incurred through activities outside of our core operations are considered non-operating and are classified as other (expense) income. These activities primarily include interest earned on the investing of excess cash, interest expense related to outstanding debt facilities, dividend income, income and unrealized gains and losses related to investments held in a trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans, and equity earnings or losses from our investments in other business ventures.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following are summaries of changes in financial performance and include certain non-GAAP financial measures. Management uses these non-GAAP measures internally in conjunction with GAAP measures to help evaluate our performance and to help make financial and operational decisions. These non-GAAP financial measures assist management in comparing our performance on a consistent basis for purposes of business decision making by removing the impact of certain items management believes do not reflect our underlying operations.\nWe believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency into financial measures used by management and is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance.\nThese non-GAAP financial measures are not presented in accordance with, or as an alternative to, GAAP financial measures and may be calculated differently from non-GAAP measures used by other companies, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. We encourage analysts, investors and other interested parties to use these non-GAAP measures as supplemental information to the GAAP financial measures included herein, including our consolidated financial statements, to enhance their analysis and understanding of our performance and in making comparisons. Please see the footnotes below for definitions, additional information, and reconciliations from the closest GAAP measure.\n​\n64\nComparison of Years Ended December 31, 2021 and 2020\nOverview\nThe following summarizes changes in financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n​\n* Not meaningful\n65\n​\n66\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income (loss) allocated to common stockholders to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA (in millions):\n​\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income allocated to common stockholders to adjusted earnings (in millions):\n​\n​\n67\nThe following summarizes changes in certain operational and financial metrics for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020:\n​\n​\n68\nThe following table includes operational and financial metrics for our Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, and Global FX segments.

Services\nTechnology support services costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increased market data support services fees, data center hosting, network and phone connectivity support services fees, and hardware maintenance fees related to acquisitions made in 2020 and 2021.\nProfessional Fees and Outside Services\nProfessional and outside services fees increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to increases in legal fees of $7.8 million driven by additional litigation fees and higher general legal fees, regulatory fees of $5.4 million driven by rising CAT costs, $3.7 million in contract services, and $2.4 million in consulting fees in connection with acquisitions made in 2020 and 2021.\nTravel and Promotional Expenses\nTravel and promotional expenses increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in marketing and advertising expenses attributable to promotional efforts.\nFacilities Costs\nFacilities costs increased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to an increase in rent expense related to the new headquarters building, additional office locations due to acquisitions made in 2020 and 2021, and the new trading floor location.\n74\nAcquisition-Related Costs\nAcquisition-related costs decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a decrease in overall acquisition activity, partially offset by the $11.0 million write-off of the Company’s investment in Signal Trading Systems, LLC in the fourth quarter of 2020, coupled with the $8.1 million facilities-related impairment charge in the second quarter of 2020.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to a $6.7 million provision for notes receivable recorded in the third quarter of 2020, related to the CAT, as well as a gain on change in contingent consideration related to MATCHNow recorded in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by increases in taxes, licenses, permits, and training and education expenses.\nOperating Income\nAs a result of the items above, operating income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n805.9\nmillion, compared to $\n662.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $\n143.7\nmillion, or\n2\n2%.\nInterest Expense, Net\nNet interest expense increased for the year ended De\ncember 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to commitment fees related to the EuroCCP Credit Facility, which was entered into in July 2020 and subsequently amended and restated in July 2021, as well as additional interest expense related to the 1.625% Senior Notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nOther (Expense) Income, Net\nNet other (expense) income decreased for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the same period in 2020 primarily due to the $32.6 million bargain purchase gain related to the EuroCCP acquisition recorded in the third quarter of 2020, coupled with a $5.0 million impairment on investment recorded in the third quarter of 2021.\nIncome Before Income Tax Provision\nAs a result of the above, income before income tax provision for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\n$756.1\nmillion compared to\n$660.4\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $\n95.7\nmillion, or\n1\n4%.\nIncome Tax Provision\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the income tax provision was $\n227.1\nmillion compared to\n$192.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of $34.9 million, primarily due to the increase in income before income tax provision and a higher effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021. The effective tax rate for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\n30.0\n%, compared to a rate of\n29.1%\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet Income\nAs a result of the items above, net income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was\n$529.0\nmillion, or\n36%\nof revenues less cost of revenues, compared to\n$\n468.2\nmillion, or\n37%\nof revenues less cost of revenues, for the year ended December 31, 2020, an increase of\n$60.8\nmillion, or\n13\n%.\n75\nSegment Operating Results\nWe report results from our five segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, and Global FX. Segment performance is primarily based on operating income (loss). We have aggregated all corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within Corporate Items and Eliminations as those activities should not be used to evaluate a segment's operating performance. All operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.\nThe following summarizes our total revenues by segment (in millions, except percentages):\n​\n​\n*  Not meaningful\n76\n​\nThe following summarizes our revenues less cost of revenues by segment (in millions, except percentages):\n​\n​\n*  Not meaningful\n77\nOptions\nThe following summarizes revenues less cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for our Options segment\n(in millions, except percentages)\n:\n*  Not meaningful\nRevenues less cost of revenues increased $\n105.3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a 22% increase in multi-listed options ADV, coupled with an 11% increase in index options ADV and an 18% increase in multi-listed options RPC. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating income increased $\n107.\n6 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to an increase in revenues less cost of revenues. Operating expenses decreased $\n2.\n3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a decrease in acquisition-related costs, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits, facilities costs, and travel and promotional expenses.\nNorth American Equities\nThe following summarizes revenues less cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, EBITDA and EBITDA margin for our North American Equities segment\n(in millions, except percentages)\n:\n*\nNot meaningful\nRevenues less cost of revenues increased $\n35.9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to additional revenue attributed to BIDS. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating income decreased $\n3.\n4 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to an increase in operating expenses, partially offset by an increase in revenues less cost of revenues\n. Operating expenses increased $39.3 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services, partially offset by decreases in acquisition-related costs and other expenses.\n78\nEurope and Asia Pacific\nThe following summarizes revenues\nless cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, EBITDA and EBITDA margin\nfor our Europe and Asia Pacific segment (in millions, except percentages):\n*\nNot meaningful\nRevenues less cost of revenues increased $\n69.5\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to additional revenue attributed to EuroCCP, Cboe Australia, and Cboe Japan, as well as a 12% increase in European Equities matched ADNV. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating income increased $\n22.5\nmillion compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to an increase in revenues less cost of revenues, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses.\nOperating expenses increased $\n47.0\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits, technology support services, depreciation and amortization, and professional fees and outside services.\nFutures\nThe following summarizes revenues less cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, EBITDA, and EBITDA margin for our Futures segment\n(in millions, except percentages)\n:\n*\nNot meaningful\nRevenues less cost of revenues increased $11.0 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a 15% increase in Futures ADV. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating income increased $12.2 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to an increase in revenues less cost of revenues. Operating expenses decreased $1.2 million for the year ended December 31, 2021\n79\ncompared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to decreases in other expenses, compensation and benefits, and technology and support services, partially offset by an increase in travel and promotional expenses.\nGlobal FX\nThe following summarizes revenues\nless cost of revenues, operating expenses, operating income, EBITDA and EBITDA margin\nfor our Global FX segment (in millions, except percentages):\n*\nNot meaningful\nRevenues less cost of revenues decreased $\n0.2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to a 2% decrease in Global FX ADNV. For the year ended December 31, 2021, operating income decreased $\n3.\n3 million compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 due to an increase in operating expenses\n. Operating expenses increased $\n3.\n1 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily due to increases in compensation and benefits and professional fees and outside services, partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization.\n​\n80\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nBelow are charts that reflect elements of our capital allocation:\n​\nWe expect our cash on hand at December 31, 2021 and other available resources, including cash generated from operations, to be sufficient to continue to meet our cash requirements for the foreseeable future. In the near term, we expect that our cash from operations and availability under the Revolving Credit Facility will meet our cash needs to fund our operations, capital expenditures, interest payments on debt, debt repayments, any dividends, and opportunities for common stock repurchases under the previously announced program. We may also utilize excess cash on hand to pay down amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement. See Note 12 (“Debt”) to the consolidated financial statements for further information. To the extent that our cash sources are insufficient to fund our potential acquisitions, we may participate in future financing transactions to obtain additional capital.\nEuroCCP also has a €1.5 billion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility agreement with EuroCCP as borrower and the Company as guarantor of scheduled interest and fees on borrowings (but not the principal amount of any borrowings), (the “Facility”). The Facility is available to be drawn by EuroCCP towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system. Borrowings under the Facility are secured by cash, eligible bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by EuroCCP into secured accounts. As a result, should the Facility be drawn by EuroCCP it could potentially impact EuroCCP’s liquidity, and we can give no assurance that this Facility will be sufficient to meet all of such obligations or sufficiently mitigate EuroCCP’s liquidity risk to meet its payment obligations when due. Additionally, a default of the Facility may allow lenders, under certain circumstances, to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the Company’s other outstanding debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which may limit the Company’s liquidity, business and financing activities. The Facility is expected to terminate on June 30, 2022 and we may not be able to enter into a replacement facility on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nOur long-term cash needs will depend on many factors, including an introduction of new products, enhancements of current products, the geographic mix of our business and any potential acquisitions. We believe our cash from operations and the availability under our Revolving Credit Facility will meet any long-term needs unless a significant acquisition or acquisitions are identified, in which case we expect that we would be able to borrow the necessary funds and/or issue additional shares of our common stock to complete such acquisition(s). In addition, we do not expect COVID-19 to have a material impact on our liquidity or capital resources, including cash from operations or uses of cash, or change our ability to access capital markets in the near term or the foreseeable future.\nCash and cash equivalents include cash in banks and all non-restricted, highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 increased\n81\n$\n96.5\nmillion from December 31, 2020 primarily due to results of operations, adjustment for depreciation expense, proceeds from available-for-sale financial investments, and proceeds from the term loan modification, partially offset by contributions to investments, cash dividends paid on common stock, and acquisitions, net of cash acquired. See “Cash Flow” below for further discussion.\nOur cash and cash equivalents held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $185.9 million and $128.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The remaining balance was held in the United States and totaled $156.0 million and $117.2 million as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The majority of cash held outside the United States is available for repatriation, but under current law, could subject us to additional United States income taxes, less applicable foreign tax credits.\nOur financial investments include deferred compensation plan assets as well as investments with original or acquired maturities longer than three months but that mature in less than one year from the balance sheet date and are recorded at fair value. As of December 31, 2021, financial investments consisted of U.S. Treasury securities and deferred compensation plan assets.\nOur off-balance sheet arrangements include clearing operations related to EuroCCP. See Note 14 (“Clearing Operations”) for discussion of contingent assets and liabilities related to clearing operations in connection with the Company’s acquisition of EuroCCP.\nCash Flow\nThe following table summarizes our cash flow data for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\nNet Cash Flows Provided by Operating Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash provided by operating activities was $\n67.8\nmillion higher than net income. The variance is primarily attributable to the adjustment for depreciation and amortization expense of $167.4 million, the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $45.0 million, and the change in unrecognized tax benefits of $33.2 million, partially offset by the change in Section 31 fees payable of $112.1 million and the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents, driven by a $66.2 million decrease in margin deposits and clearing funds related to EuroCCP for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet cash flows provided by operating activities were $596.8 million and $\n1,458.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The change in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the change in restricted cash and cash equivalents, driven by margin deposits and clearing funds related to EuroCCP, as well as the change in Section 31 fees payable, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable, as well as the change in the bargain purchase gain and provision for deferred income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\n82\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $\n990.6\nmillion higher than net income for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe variance is primarily attributed to the addition of $812.1 million of restricted cash and cash equivalents, driven by margin deposits and clearing funds related to EuroCCP, the adjustment for depreciation and amortization expense of $158.5 million, the change in accounts payable and accrued liabilities of $59.4 million, and the change in Section 31 fees payable of $53.9 million, partially offset by the change in accounts receivable of $90.0 million.\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $1,458.8 million and $632.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in net cash flows provided by operating activities was primarily due to the addition of margin deposits and clearing funds resulting from the EuroCCP acquisition and the increase in net income.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Investing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities primarily consisted of contributions to investments of $209.8 million, acquisitions, net of cash acquired of $151.5 million, and purchases of available-for-sale financial investments of $101.2 million, partially offset by proceeds from available-for-sale financial investments of $160.2 million.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities were\n$\n352.7 million and $430.5 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The variance is primarily due to the change in acquisitions, net of cash acquired, and the change in purchases of available-for-sale financial investments, partially offset by contributions to investments and the change in proceeds from available-for-sale financial investments for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nNet cash flows used in investing activities totaled $\n430.5\nmillion and $\n15.9\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The variance is primarily due to acquisitions, net of cash acquired in 2020 and the return of capital from investments in 2019.\nCapital expenditures are expected to be in the range of $47.0 million to $52.0 million, reflecting expenditures associated with the Company’s trading floor relocation, which is anticipated to occur in the second quarter of 2022, ongoing capacity and technology-related investments, as well as anticipated project delays due to supply chain interruptions.\nNet Cash Flows Used in Financing Activities\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities primarily consisted of cash dividends paid on common stock of $193.3 million and share repurchases of $81.3 million, partially offset by proceeds from long-term debt of $110.0 million.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities were $200.3 million and $201.7 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The variance is primarily due to the change in share repurchases, as well as the change in principal payments of long-term debt, partially offset by the change in proceeds from long-term debt.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company received proceeds from long-term debt of $493.7 million, of which $70.0 million was used to pay down the revolving credit facility draw taken in the third quarter of 2020, repurchased $349.1 million of common stock, paid dividends totaling $170.6 million, and paid down $155.0 million of long-term debt.\nNet cash flows used in financing activities totaled $662.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. The Company paid down $350.0 million of long-term debt, repurchased $156.9 million of common stock, and paid dividends of $150.0 million.\n83\nFinancial Assets\nThe following summarizes our financial assets excluding margin deposits and clearing funds as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nDebt\n​\nThe following summarizes our debt obligations as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\n​\nAt December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of our debt agreements.\nIn addition to the debt outstanding, as of December 31, 2021, we had an additional $250.0 million available through our revolving credit facility, with the ability to borrow another $100.0 million by increasing the commitments under the facility. Together with adjusted cash, we had $675.1 million available to fund our operations, capital expenditures, potential acquisitions, debt repayments and any dividends as of December 31, 2021.\nDividends\nThe Company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the Company's Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including our earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations our Board of Directors deems relevant. Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, our ability to pay dividends.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn 2011, the Board of Directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of $100 million and approved additional authorizations of $100 million in each of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016, $250 million in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, and $200 million in February 2021, for a total authorization of $1.6 billion. The program permits the Company to purchase shares through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation.\n​\n84\nUnder the program, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased 822,005 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $98.82, totaling $81.3 million. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased 18,072,129 shares of common stock at an average cost per share of $68.12, totaling $1.2 billion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $318.9 million of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.\nLease and Obligations\nThe Company currently leases additional office space, data centers and remote network operations center, with lease terms remaining from 7 months to 186 months as of December 31, 2021. In September 2019, we entered into two leases that commenced in 2020 for a new principal office space and trading floor space, both located in Chicago, Illinois. Additionally, in October 2021, the Company signed a new lease that commenced in February 2022 for a new principal office space in Amsterdam. See Note 24 (“Leases”) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nTotal rent expense related to current and former lease obligations for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 totaled $25.6 million, $20.2 million and $12.4 million, respectively. I\nn addition to our lease obligations, we have contractual obligations related to certain operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, and our long-term debt outstanding.\nPurchase obligations include our estimate of the minimum outstanding obligations under agreements to purchase goods or services that we believe are enforceable and legally binding and that specify all significant terms, including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased; fixed or minimum and maximum amounts to be paid; and the approximate timing of the transaction. Purchase obligations include certain licensing agreements with various licensors which contain annual minimum fee requirements as well as payments calculated using agreed upon contract rates and reported cleared volumes. Purchase obligations exclude agreements that are cancellable at any time without penalty.\nWe have excluded from the contractual obligations listed below $745.9 million in cash margin deposits and clearing funds. Clearing participants of EuroCCP are required to make deposits to a clearing fund. The cash deposits made by clearing participants are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet as current assets with equal and offsetting current liabilities. See Note 14 (“Clearing Operations”) to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on EuroCCP and the margin deposits and clearing funds.\nFuture minimum payments under these leases and agreements were as follows as of December 31, 2021:\n​\nCommercial Commitments and Contractual Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2021, our commercial commitments and contractual obligations included operating leases, data and telecommunications agreements, equipment leases, our long-term debt outstanding, contingent considerations and other obligations. See Note 23 (“Commitments, Contingencies, and Guarantees”) to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of commitments and contingencies, Note 12 (“Debt”) for a discussion of the outstanding debt, Note 14 (“Clearing Operations”) for information on EuroCCP’s clearinghouse exposure guarantee, and Note 24 (“Leases”) for discussion on operating leases and equipment leases.\nGuarantees\nWe use Wedbush and Morgan Stanley to clear our routed equities transactions for our U.S. Equities exchanges. Wedbush and Morgan Stanley guarantee the trade until one day after the trade date, after which time the NSCC provides a guarantee.\nThe BIDS Trading ATS platform delivers matched trades to BOA, which delivers the matched trades to the NSCC.\nBOA guarantees the trade until one day after the trade date, after which time the NSCC provides a guarantee. In\n85\nthe case of failure to perform on the part of Wedbush or Morgan Stanley on routed transactions for our U.S. Equities exchanges, we provide the guarantee to the counterparty to the trader. In the case of failure to perform on the part of BOA on transactions for the BIDS Trading ATS platform, BIDS has obligations to the counterparties to satisfy the trades. OCC acts as a central counterparty on all transactions in listed equity options in our Options segment, and as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our options transactions. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly, have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees.\nSimilarly, with respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to The Canadian Depository for Securities, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. With respect to Australian equities and derivatives, we deliver matched trades of our customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Australia. With respect to Japanese equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the Japanese Securities Clearing Corporation, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Japan and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Japan.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its estimates, including those related to areas that require a significant level of judgment or are otherwise subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty. The Company bases its estimates on historical experience, observance of trends in particular areas, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Information from these sources form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources.\nWe have identified the estimates below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations. The impact of, and any associated risks related to, these estimates on our business operations is discussed throughout \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\" For a detailed discussion on these estimates and other accounting policies, see Note\n2\n(“Summary of Significant Accounting Policies”)\nto the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nDescription\nOur acquisitions of Bats, Cboe Vest Financial Group Inc. (“Vest”), Silexx Financial Systems, LLC (“Silexx”), LiveVol, Hanweck, FT Options, Trade Alert, MATCHNow, BIDS Holdings and Chi-X APAC resulted in the recording of goodwill and other intangible assets, while our acquisition of EuroCCP, resulted in a bargain purchase gain and other intangible assets. In accordance with ASC 350—\nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other\n, we test the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances signal indicators of impairment are present.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nThe estimated fair values of our reporting units are based on the market approach and the income approach (using discounted estimated future cash flows). The estimated fair values of indefinite-lived intangibles used the income approach. The discounted estimated future cash flow analysis requires judgments about the discount rate, forecasted revenue growth rate, and operating expenses, that are inherent in these fair value estimates over the estimated remaining operating period. Additionally, the analysis contains uncertainty surrounding future events. As such, actual results may differ from these estimates and lead to a revaluation of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets.\n​\n86\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\n​\nIf updated estimates indicate that the fair value of goodwill or any indefinite-lived intangibles is less than the carrying value of the asset, an impairment charge is expected to be recorded in the consolidated statements of income in the period of the change in estimate, which could result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements. However, due to the results of our impairment analyses in 2021, in which all reporting units estimated fair value exceeded their carrying value, we do not consider our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangibles to have a significant risk of impairment.\n​\nIncome Taxes\n​\nDescription\nThe Company’s consolidated global income tax provision, deferred tax assets and liabilities, valuation allowances, and liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are determined through the interpretation of tax laws and assumptions of future events to calculate an expectation of future tax consequences.\nJudgments and Uncertainties\nOn an ongoing basis, the Company evaluates its tax estimates and judgments. This evaluation is based on factors including historical experience, such as the conclusions of examinations by tax authorities, changes in tax laws or rates, new examination activity, and results of any related legal processes.\nWe use judgment in the evaluation of uncertain tax positions and the estimation of unrecognized tax benefits\nwhen determining the largest amount greater than 50% likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the taxing authority\n, assessing the likelihood of the benefit being realized upon settlement, and the calculating expected ultimate settlement amount.\nEffect if Actual Results Differ from Assumptions\nSignificant changes in these estimates or judgments may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a future period. Additionally, it is possible that the ultimate settlement may differ from the liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits currently reported if tax authorities ultimately reach a conclusion that differs from the Company’s expectation. We believe assumptions made regarding income taxes to be reasonable and do not believe any change in the judgments made by management would result in a material change to the consolidated financial statements.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nSee Note 3 (“Recent Accounting Pronouncements”) to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to the Company\n."

We also have de minimis exposure to other foreign currencies, including the Swiss Franc, Norwegian Kroner, Swedish Krona, Danish Kroner, and Philippine Peso.\n87\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our exposure to foreign-denominated revenues and expenses is presented by primary foreign currency in the following table (in millions, except percentages):\nEquity Risk\nOur investment in European, Canadian, and Asia Pacific operations is exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of our net assets or equity to U.S. dollars. The assets and liabilities of our European businesses are denominated in British pounds or Euros. The assets and liabilities of our Canadian businesses are denominated in Canadian dollars. The assets and liabilities of our Asia Pacific businesses are denominated in Hong Kong dollars, Australian dollars, Japanese Yen, or Philippine Pesos. Fluctuations in currency exchange rates may create volatility in our reported results as we are required to translate foreign currency reported statements of financial condition and operational results into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting. The translation of these non-U.S. dollar statements of financial condition into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting results in a cumulative translation adjustment, which is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income, net within stockholders' equity on our consolidated balance sheet.\nOur primary exposure to this equity risk as of December 31, 2021 is presented by foreign currency in the following table (in millions):\nCredit Risk\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We limit our exposure to credit risk by considering such risk when selecting the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements.\nWe do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to trades matched on our exchanges in the U.S., Canada, and Europe. With respect to listed equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the NSCC without taking on counterparty risk for those trades. NSCC acts as a central counterparty on all equity transactions occurring on BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched equity trades. Similarly, with respect to U.S. listed equity options and futures, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the OCC, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX and CFE and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched options and futures trades. With respect to Canadian equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to The Canadian Depository for Securities, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on MATCHNow and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement of all of our matched Canadian equities trades. The BIDS Trading ATS platform delivers matched trades to BOA, which delivers the matched trades to the NSCC.\nBOA guarantees the trade until one day after the trade date, after which time the NSCC provides a guarantee.\n88\nThus, BIDS Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event BOA fails.\nWith respect to Australian equities and derivatives, we deliver matched trades of our customers to ASX Clear Pty Ltd and ASX Settlement Pty Ltd. ASX Clear Pty Ltd acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Australia and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Australia. With respect to Japanese equities, we deliver matched trades of our customers to the Japanese Securities Clearing Corporation, which acts as a central counterparty on all transactions occurring on Cboe Japan and, as such, guarantees clearance and settlement on all of our matched trades in Japan.\nWith respect to orders Cboe Trading routes to other markets for execution on behalf of our customers, Cboe Trading is exposed to some counterparty credit risk in the case of failure to perform on the part of our clearing firms, Morgan Stanley or Wedbush. Morgan Stanley and Wedbush guarantee trades until one day after the trade date, after which time NSCC provides a guarantee. The BIDS Trading ATS platform delivers matched trades to BOA, which delivers the matched trades to the NSCC.\nThus, Cboe Trading is potentially exposed to credit risk to the counterparty to a trade routed to another market center between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that Morgan Stanley or Wedbush fails. The BIDS Trading ATS platform is potentially exposed to counterparty credit risk on equities trades between the trade date and one day after the trade date in the event that BOA fails. We believe that any potential requirement for us to make payments under these guarantees is remote and accordingly, have not recorded any liability in the consolidated financial statements for these guarantees.\nHistorically, we have not incurred any liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or more visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions.\nWe do not have counterparty credit risk with respect to institutional spot FX trades occurring on our platform because Cboe FX is not a counterparty to any FX transactions. All transactions occurring on our platform occur bilaterally between two banks or prime brokers as counterparties to the trade. While Cboe FX does not have direct counterparty risk, Cboe FX may suffer a decrease in transaction volume if a bank or prime broker experiences an event that causes other prime brokers to decrease or revoke the credit available to the prime broker experiencing the event. Therefore, Cboe FX may have risk that is related to the credit of the banks and prime brokers that trade FX on the Cboe FX platform.\nWe also have credit risk related to transaction fees that are billed in arrears to customers on a monthly basis. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our balance sheet. Our customers are financial institutions whose ability to satisfy their contractual obligations may be impacted by volatile securities markets.\nAs a result of the acquisition of EuroCCP on July 1, 2020, the Company is exposed to further credit risk through our clearing operations. EuroCCP holds material amounts of clearing participant collateral, both cash and non-cash deposits, which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit risk as well as liquidity and market risks. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated:\n•\nCredit Risk\n-\nThe credit risk is predominantly in the event a clearing participant fails to meet a financial or contractual obligation. EuroCCP attempts to mitigate this risk through minimum participant requirements for clearing participants and monitoring their financial health. To cover potential loss to EuroCCP in the event of a clearing participant default, collateral is required from clearing participants. Besides potential defaults of clearing participants, the main credit risk faced by the clearinghouse is exposure to clearing participants when a trade fails to settle. To help mitigate this risk, a fail fee is charged to discourage late settlements. This fee covers EuroCCP’s costs but also acts as a deterrent as required by Regulation (EU) No 236/2012 on short selling, together with certain aspects of credit default swaps.\n•\nLiquidity Risk\n-\nLiquidity risk is the risk EuroCCP may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and at the right time. To help mitigate this risk, EuroCCP monitors its liquidity requirements closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which attempt to minimize the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or making only short-term investments serves to help reduce liquidity risks. Liquidity is mainly required for securities settlement. The payment and settlement obligations generally stem from the function of EuroCCP as a cash equity clearinghouse: shares are bought and sold by clearing participants on a trading platform or OTC, and netted to settle two days later. During the settlement the actual payment for and delivery of the shares take place, this process requires intraday liquidity. If\n89\ncounterparties, which receive shares against payment, are unable to settle, an overnight liquidity need arises. The overnight liquidity is typically very short term, and is usually limited to a few days.\n•\nMarket Risk\n- EuroCCP is also exposed to market risk in the event that a clearing participant defaults and the market prices of the securities in its open positions have moved adversely so the clearinghouse can only close out the participant’s obligations at a loss. To help mitigate market risk, EuroCCP collects collateral from clearing participants to cover for the probable loss during normal market conditions, together with contributions to the clearing fund to cover losses if a default occurred during extreme but plausible market conditions. Adverse movements in exchange rates affecting the value of obligations and collateral are factored into the calculation of the amount of collateral to be collected.\nOn a regular basis, we review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations. Any such effects to date have been minimal.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relating to our cash and cash equivalents, financial investments, and indebtedness. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments were $379.0 million and $337.8 million, respectively, of which $185.9 million and $128.0 million is held outside of the United States in various foreign subsidiaries in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The remaining cash and cash equivalents and financial investments are denominated in U.S. dollars. We do not use our investment portfolio for trading or other speculative purposes. Due to the nature of these investments, we have not been exposed to, nor do we anticipate being exposed to, material risks due to changes in interest rates, assuming no change in the amount or composition of our cash and cash equivalents and financial investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $1,299.3 million in outstanding debt, of which $1,139.9 million relates to our Senior Notes, which bear interest at fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixed-rate obligations. The remaining amounts outstanding of $159.5 million relates to the Term Loan Agreement, which bears interest at fluctuating rates and, therefore, subjects us to interest rate risk. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relating to the amounts outstanding under the Term Loan Agreement as of December 31, 2021 would decrease annual pre-tax earnings by $1.6 million, assuming no change in the composition of our outstanding indebtedness. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our Revolving Credit Agreement and the EuroCCP Credit Facility, as these facilities bear interest at fluctuating rates. As of December 31, 2021, there were no outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit agreement and no outstanding borrowings under the EuroCCP Credit Facility. See Note 12 (“Debt”) to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements.\nLiquidity Risk\nWe are exposed to liquidity risk under certain circumstances in relation to the cross-acceleration and cross-default provisions within the Term Loan Agreement and the Revolving Credit Agreement as a result of the Company, as guarantor, entering into the EuroCCP Credit Facility. A default of the Facility may allow lenders to accelerate any related drawn amounts and may result in the acceleration of the Company’s other outstanding debt to which a cross-acceleration or cross-default provision applies, which may limit the Company’s liquidity, business and financing activities. See Note 12 (“Debt”) to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of debt agreements.\n​\n90"

In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for the years then ended, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese consolidated financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the\nconsolidated financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of a critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nEvaluation of unrecognized tax benefits\nAs discussed in Notes 2 and 21 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based upon the largest benefit that has greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement.\n92\nWe identified the evaluation of unrecognized tax benefits in certain jurisdictions as a critical audit matter. A higher degree of auditor judgment and the involvement of professionals with specialized skills and knowledge was required to evaluate the Company’s estimate of tax benefits to be realized upon ultimate settlement of its tax positions.\nThe following are the primary procedures we performed to address this critical audit matter. We evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of certain internal controls over the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits process, including controls over the estimate of tax benefits to be realized upon ultimate settlement of tax positions. We evaluated the Company’s ability to estimate its unrecognized tax benefits by comparing historical unrecognized tax benefits to actual results upon the conclusion of examinations by applicable taxing authorities. In addition, we involved tax professionals with specialized skills and knowledge who assisted in:\n—\nanalyzing the Company’s tax positions, including the measurement of unrecognized tax benefits\n—\nevaluating changes in applicable laws and regulations\n—\ninspecting settlements with applicable taxing authorities.\n​\n/s/\nKPMG LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2020.\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 18, 2022\n​\n​\n93\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\n​\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Cboe Global Markets, Inc.\n​\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\n​\nWe have audited the consolidated statements of\nincome, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows of\nCboe Global Markets, Inc.\nand subsidiaries (the \"Company\") for the year ended December 31, 2019, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the results of the Company’s operations and its cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2019, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\n​\nBasis for Opinion\n​\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\n​\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audit included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audit also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n​\n/s/\nDELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 21, 2020\nWe began serving as the Company’s auditor in 1973. In 2020 we became the predecessor auditor.\n​\n94\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and Board of Directors\nCboe Global Markets, Inc.:\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and subsidiaries’ (the Company) internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity, and cash flows for the years then ended, and the related notes (collectively, the consolidated financial statements), and our report dated February 18, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated financial statements.\nManagement’s assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, excluded Chi-X Asia Pacific, acquired with effect from July 1, 2021. This acquired business had total assets and total stockholders’ equity of $266.5 million and $242.5 million, respectively, and total revenues and revenues less costs of revenues of $17.1 million and $16.7 million, respectively, which are included in the Company’s consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also excluded an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of Chi-X Asia Pacific.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audit also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely\n95\ndetection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\nKPMG LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 18, 2022\n​\n​\n​\n​\n96\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated\nBalance Sheets\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020\n(In millions, except share and per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\n.\n​\n97\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nYears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements\n.\n​\n98\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nYears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n​\n​\n99\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders’ Equity\nYears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n​\n100\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nYears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n(In millions)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n​\n101\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. and Subsidiaries\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the\nYears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n1.  NATURE OF OPERATIONS\nCboe Global Markets, Inc. (“Cboe” or “the Company”), a leading provider of market infrastructure and tradable products, delivers cutting-edge trading, clearing and investment solutions to market participants around the world. The Company is committed to operating a trusted, inclusive global marketplace, providing leading products, technology and data solutions that enable participants to define a sustainable financial future. Cboe provides trading solutions and products in multiple asset classes, including equities, derivatives and FX, across North America, Europe, and Asia Pacific.\nCboe’s subsidiaries include the largest options exchange and the third largest stock exchange operator in the U.S. In addition, the Company operates one of the largest stock exchanges by value traded in Europe, and owns EuroCCP, a leading pan-European equities and derivatives clearinghouse, BIDS Trading, a leading block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S., MATCHNow, a leading equities ATS in Canada, Cboe Australia, an operator of trading venues in Australia, and Cboe Japan, an operator of trading venues in Japan. Cboe also is a leading market globally for exchange-traded products (“ETPs”) listings and trading.\nThe Company is headquartered in Chicago with offices in Amsterdam, Belfast, Calgary, Hong Kong, Kansas City, London, Manila, New York, San Francisco, Sarasota Springs, Singapore, Sydney, Tokyo and Toronto.\n2.  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nThese consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) as established by FASB.\nThe accompanying financial statements are presented on a consolidated basis to include the accounts and transactions of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. and its majority owned subsidiaries and all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities, and reported amounts of revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, management evaluates its estimates based upon historical experience, observance of trends, information available from outside sources and various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different conditions or assumptions.\nFor those consolidated subsidiaries in which the Company’s ownership is less than 100% and for which the Company has control over the assets and liabilities and the management of the entity, the outside stockholders’ interest is shown as noncontrolling interest.\nSegment information\nThe Company has\nfive\nbusiness segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, and Global FX, which is reflective of how the Company’s chief operating decision-maker reviews and operates the business. See Note 16 (“Segment Reporting”) for more information.\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as well as disclosure of the amounts of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of\n102\nrevenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Material estimates that are particularly susceptible to significant change in the near term include the valuation of goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, and unrecognized tax benefits.\nThe Company’s cash and cash equivalents are exposed to concentrations of credit risk. The Company maintains cash at various regulated financial institutions and brokerage firms which, at times, may be in excess of the federal depository insurance limit. The Company’s management regularly monitors these institutions and believes that the potential for future loss is remote. The Company considers liquid investments with original or acquired maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nFinancial investments are classified as trading or available-for-sale.\nTrading financial investments represent financial investments held by Cboe Trading that retain the industry-specific accounting classification required for broker-dealers and marketable securities held in a rabbi trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans. The investments held by the broker-dealer subsidiary are recorded at fair value with changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected within interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. The investments held in a trust are recorded at fair value with changes in unrealized gains or losses recorded within other income (expense) and the equal and offsetting charges in the related liability are recorded in compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income.\nAvailable-for-sale financial investments are comprised of the financial investments not held by Cboe Trading, including highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities. Unrealized gains and losses, net of income taxes, are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets.\nInterest on financial investments, including amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts, is recognized as income when earned. Realized gains and losses on financial investments are calculated using the specific identification method and are included in interest expense, net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\nA decline in the fair value of any available-for-sale investment below carrying value that is deemed to be other-than-temporary results in an impairment to reduce the carrying value to realizable value. To determine whether an impairment is other-than-temporary, the Company considers all available information relevant to the collectability of the investment, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts when developing estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. Evidence considered in this assessment includes the reasons for the impairment, the severity and duration of the impairment, changes in value subsequent to year-end, forecasted performance of the investee, and the general market condition in the geographic area or industry in which the investee operates.\nAccounts receivable are concentrated with the Company’s member firms and market data distributors and are carried at amortized cost. The Company nets transaction fees and liquidity payments for each member firm on a monthly basis and recognizes the total owed from a member firm as accounts receivable, net and the total owed to a member firm as accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets. On a periodic basis, management evaluates the Company’s accounts receivable and records an allowance for expected credit losses using an aging schedule. The aging schedule applies loss rates based on historical loss information and, as deemed necessary, is adjusted for differences in the nature of the receivables that exist at the reporting date from the historical period. Due to the short-term nature of the accounts receivable, changes in future economic conditions are not expected to have a significant impact on the expected credit losses.\nThe accounts receivable are presented net of allowance for credit losses on the consolidated balance sheets and the associated losses are presented in other operating expenses on the consolidated statements of income.\n103\nProperty and equipment, net is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the estimated lives of the assets, generally ranging from\nthree\nto\nseven years\n. Expenditures for repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation of leasehold improvements is calculated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the related lease term or the estimated useful life of the assets.\nLong-lived assets to be held and used are reviewed to determine whether any events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of the assets may not be recoverable. The Company bases this evaluation on such impairment indicators as the nature of the assets, the future economic benefit of the assets, any historical or future profitability measurements, as well as other external market conditions or factors that may be present. If such impairment indicators are present that would indicate that the carrying value of any asset may not be recoverable, the Company determines whether an impairment has occurred through the use of an undiscounted cash flow analysis of the asset at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. In the event of impairment, the Company recognizes a loss for the difference between the carrying value and the estimated value of the asset as measured using quoted market prices or, in the absence of quoted market prices, a discounted cash flow analysis.\nThe Company expenses software development costs as incurred during the preliminary project stage, while capitalizing costs incurred during the application development stage, which includes design, coding, installation and testing activities.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net tangible and identifiable intangible assets of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to the Company’s reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. The Company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying value may be impaired. The impairment test is performed during the fourth quarter using October 1\nst\ncarrying values, and if the fair value of the reporting unit is found to be less than the carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded. The Company performed its 2021 annual goodwill impairment test and determined that\nno\nimpairment existed.\nIntangible assets, net, primarily include acquired trademarks and trade names, customer relationships, strategic alliance agreements, licenses and registrations and non-compete agreements. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortized based on the discounted cash flow method applied over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets and are tested for impairment if certain events occur indicating that the carry value may be impaired.\nIntangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives are not amortized, but instead are tested for impairment at least annually, usually concurrently with goodwill. Impairment exists if the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying value, and in that case, an impairment loss is recorded. The Company performed its 2021 annual intangible assets impairment test using October 1, 2021 carrying values and determined that\nno\nimpairment existed.\nThe Company accounts for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method with the shares of stock repurchased reflected as a reduction to Cboe stockholders’ equity and included in common stock in treasury, at cost in the consolidated balance sheets. Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase program are either available to be redistributed or they are retired. The Company accounts for the retirement of treasury stock by deducting its par value from common stock and reflecting any excess of cost over par value as a deduction from additional paid-in-capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe financial statements of foreign subsidiaries where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar are translated into U.S. dollars using the exchange rate in effect as of each balance sheet date. Statements of income and cash flow amounts are translated using the average exchange rate during the period. The cumulative effects of translating the balance sheet accounts from the functional currency into the U.S. dollar at the applicable exchange rates are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets. Foreign currency gains and losses are recorded as other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company’s operations in the United Kingdom, Amsterdam, Canada, Singapore, Philippines, Hong Kong, Australia and Japan are\n104\nrecorded in Pounds sterling, Euros, Canadian dollars, Singapore dollars, Philippine pesos, Hong Kong dollars, Australian dollars and Japanese Yen, respectively.\nDeferred taxes are recorded on a liability method whereby deferred tax assets are recognized for deductible temporary differences and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards, and deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences. Temporary differences are the differences between the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases. Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense is recognized on the full amount of deferred benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company’s policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the income tax provision within the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company elected to account for global intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) in the period in which it is incurred, and therefore, has not provided any deferred tax impacts of GILTI in the consolidated financial statements.\nFor further discussion related to revenue recognition of fees, such as transaction and clearing fees and liquidity payments, access and capacity fees, market data fees, and regulation transaction and Section 31 fees, see Note 4 (“Revenue Recognition”).\nConcentrations of Revenue and Liquidity Payments\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019,\nno\ncustomer accounted for more than\n13\n%\nof the Company’s total revenue.\nNo customer is contractually or otherwise obligated to continue to use the Company’s services. The loss of, or a significant reduction of, participation by these customers may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, financial position, results of operations and cash flows. The\ntwo\nlargest clearing members clear the majority of the market-maker sides of transactions at all of the Company’s U.S. options exchanges. If either of these clearing members were to withdraw from the business of market-maker clearing and market-makers were unable to transfer to another clearing member, this could create significant disruption to the U.S. options markets, including Cboe’s.\nThe computation of basic earnings per share is calculated by reducing net income for the period by dividends paid or declared and undistributed net income for the period that are allocated to participating securities to arrive at net income allocated to common stockholders. Net income allocated to common stockholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to determine net income per share allocated to common stockholders.\nThe computation of diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus all additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect is calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class or treasury stock method.\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees through awards of restricted stock units. Additionally, in connection with the acquisition of Bats, the Company inherited stock options and restricted stock awards\n105\nthat had been previously awarded by Bats. As all stock options were exercised in 2020, none were outstanding in 2021. The Company grants stock-based compensation to its employees through restricted stock units and grants restricted stock awards to its board members. The Company records stock-based compensation expense for all stock-based compensation granted based on the grant-date fair value. The Company recognizes stock-based compensation expense related to stock-based compensation awards with graded vesting that have a service condition on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the entire award.\nThe amount of stock-based compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock and restricted stock units is based on the fair value of Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock at the date of grant. The fair value is based on a current market-based transaction of the Company’s common stock. If a market-based transaction of the Company’s common stock is not available, then the fair value is based on an independent third-party valuation using equal weighting of two valuation analysis techniques, discounted cash flows and valuation multiples observed from publicly traded companies in a similar industry.\nThe Company records identifiable assets, liabilities and goodwill acquired in a business combination at fair value at the acquisition date. Additionally, transaction-related costs are expensed in the period incurred.\nAll costs incurred to issue debt are capitalized as a contra-liability and amortized over the life of the debt using the interest method.\nThe Company generally accounts for investments using the measurement alternative when it owns less than 20% of the outstanding voting stock of a company, there is an absence of readily determinable fair value for the respective investment, and the Company has an inability to exercise significant influence over the investment based upon the respective ownership interests held. The Company recognizes dividend income when declared.\nIn general, the equity method of accounting is used when the Company owns 20% to 50% of the outstanding voting stock of a company and when it is able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company. For equity method investments, the Company records the pro-rata share of earnings or losses each period and records any dividends received as a reduction in the investment balance. The equity method investment is inclusive of other-than-temporary declines in value, recognized by the investee, who considers a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying value. If the estimated fair value of the investment is less than the carrying value and the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value is recognized in the financial statements as an impairment.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement contains a lease at inception. For arrangements where the Company is the lessee, operating leases are included in operating lease right of use (“ROU”) assets, accrued liabilities, and non-current operating lease liabilities on the balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. The Company does not have any finance leases as of December 31, 2021.\nROU assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future lease payments over the lease term at commencement date. ROU assets also include any initial direct costs incurred and any lease payments made at or before the lease commencement date, less lease incentives received. The Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the lease liabilities, as the rate implicit in the Company’s leases are generally not reasonably determinable. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate when the Company is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company also has lease arrangements with lease and non-lease components. The Company elected the practical expedient not to separate non-lease components from lease components for the Company’s leases. The Company elected to apply the short-term lease measurement and recognition exemption in which ROU assets and lease\n106\nliabilities are not recognized for short-term leases. For short-term operating leases, lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nLeases with an initial term of\n12 months\nor less are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet and the Company recognizes lease expense in facilities costs within the consolidated statements of income for these leases on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that can extend the lease term from\none\nto\nfive years\nor more, and some of which include the Company’s option to terminate the leases within\none year\n. When the implicit rate in the Company’s lease is not reasonably determinable, the Company applies an incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.\nMargin deposits and clearing funds in the form of cash contributions by EuroCCP’s clearing participants where title has transferred to EuroCCP are included as current assets with equal and offsetting current liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet. These margin deposits and clearing funds are deposited with De Nederlandsche Bank (“DNB”), can only be used for specified EuroCCP operations, and fluctuate over time due to changes in deposit requirements. Certain non-cash margin deposits and clearing fund deposits, as well as interoperability fund deposits, are not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet, as EuroCCP does not take economic ownership of these balances. Cash held as margin deposits and clearing fund deposits may be invested at an approved bank in accordance with EuroCCP’s investment policy, and any interest or gain received, or loss incurred on invested funds is recorded in other revenue in the consolidated statements of income.\n3.  RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – Adopted\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740) – Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes. This ASU removed certain income tax exceptions and modifies existing guidance to simplify the accounting for income taxes. For public entities, the update was effective for fiscal years and interim period within those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2020. The Company adopted this ASU on January 1, 2021, which did not result in a material impact to the consolidated financial statements and disclosures.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements – Issued, not yet Adopted\nThere were no applicable material accounting pronouncements that have been issued but were not yet adopted as of December 31, 2021.\n4.  REVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company’s main types of revenue contracts are:\n107\n108\nAll revenue recognized in the consolidated statements of income is considered to be revenue from contracts with customers, with the exception of interest income from clearing operations.\nThe following table depicts the disaggregation of revenue according to segment (in millions):\n​\n​\nContract liabilities as of December 31, 2021 primarily represent prepayments of transaction fees and certain access and capacity and market data fees to the Exchanges.\nThe revenue recognized from contract liabilities and the remaining balance is shown below (in millions):\n5.  ACQUISITIONS\nOn February 3, 2020, the Company purchased Hanweck Associates, LLC (“Hanweck”) and the assets of FT Providers, LLC (“FT Options”). Hanweck and FT Options are both providers of risk analytics market data and included in the Company’s Options segment. On June 1, 2020, the Company purchased the assets of Trade Alert, LLC (“Trade Alert”), a real-time alerts and order flow analysis service provider included in the Company’s Options segment. On August 4, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of MATCHNow, one of the largest equities ATSs in Canada, which is\n109\nincluded in the Company’s North American Equities segment. Of these acquisitions’ aggregate purchase price,\n$\n100.7\nmillion was allocated to goodwill,\n$\n59.0\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets, and\n$\n2.2\nmillion was allocated to working capital. In connection with these acquisitions, approximately\n$\n32.7\nmillion in contingent consideration (in the aggregate) related to future financial performance of the acquired business or developmental milestones has been recorded in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. These amounts represent the allocation of the purchase price. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired.\nOn July 1, 2020, the Company completed the acquisition of the remaining\n80\n%\ninterest in EuroCCP, a pan-European equities clearinghouse, which is included in the Company’s Europe and Asia Pacific segment. Of the acquisition’s purchase price of the remaining interest,\n$\n32.3\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets and\n$\n56.0\nmillion was allocated to working capital upon consolidation. Prior to signing the agreement to acquire the remaining\n80\n%\nof EuroCCP, the Company agreed on the purchase price with the other shareholders, as they were looking to liquidate their investments in EuroCCP. That agreement gave way to a\n$\n32.6\nmillion bargain purchase gain, which was included in other non-operating (expense) income, net in the consolidated statement of income. These amounts represent the allocation of the purchase price and are subject to revision during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. In connection with the acquisition, EuroCCP put in place a committed revolving credit facility of up to\n€\n1.5\nbillion, see Note 12 (“Debt”) for more information. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired.\nOn December 31, 2020, the Company purchased BIDS Holdings (“BIDS”). BIDS Holdings owns BIDS Trading, LP, a registered broker-dealer and the operator of the BIDS ATS, the largest block-trading ATS by volume in the U.S. The ATS operated by BIDS is not a registered national securities exchange or a facility thereof. The acquisition of BIDS provided the Company with a foothold in the off-exchange segment of the U.S. equities market, which allowed the Company’s presence in the North American Equities segment to expand. Of the acquisition’s purchase price,\n$\n100.0\nmillion was allocated to goodwill,\n$\n156.4\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets, and\n$\n23.3\nmillion was allocated to working capital. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired.\nOn July 1, 2021, the Company purchased Chi-X Asia Pacific. Chi-X Asia Pacific is a holding company of alternative market operators and providers of market solutions, which is included in the Company’s Europe and Asia Pacific segment. The acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific provided the Company with a single point of entry into\ntwo\nkey capital markets, Australia and Japan, to help enable it to expand its global equities and market data business into Asia Pacific, bring other products and services to the region, and further expand access to its proprietary product suite in the region. Of the acquisition’s purchase price,\n$\n133.6\nmillion was allocated to goodwill,\n$\n73.8\nmillion was allocated to intangible assets,\n$\n25.7\nmillion was allocated to working capital, and\n$\n49.6\nmillion in contingent consideration, which is earned based on developmental milestones of the acquired business. These amounts represent the allocation of the purchase price and are subject to revision during the remainder of the measurement period, a period not to exceed twelve months from the acquisition date. See below for further discussion of intangible assets acquired.\nThe following table presents the details of intangible assets at the dates of acquisition (in millions, except as stated). All acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method.\n​\nAcquisition-related costs relate to acquisitions and other strategic opportunities. The Company expensed\n$\n15.6\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2021, which primarily included\n$\n15.0\nmillion of professional fees and other expenses and\n$\n0.6\nmillion of impairment charges related to investments. These acquisition-related expenses are included in acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\n​\n​\n110\nThe Company expensed\n$\n45.3\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2020, which included\n$\n22.1\nmillion of professional fees,\n$\n15.1\nmillion of impairment charges related to investments, and other expenses and\n$\n8.1\nmillion of impairment charges related to facilities. These acquisition-related expenses are included in acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company expensed\n$\n48.5\nmillion of acquisition-related costs during the year ended December 31, 2019 that included\n$\n19.3\nmillion of compensation-related costs,\n$\n10.5\nmillion of impairment of goodwill charges,\n$\n6.1\nmillion of impairment of facilities charges,\n$\n4.5\nmillion loss on disposal of data processing software,\n$\n3.9\nmillion of professional fees,\n$\n2.2\nmillion of termination fees related to an assigned lease agreement, and\n$\n2.0\nmillion of general and administrative expenses. These acquisition-related expenses are included in acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\n​\n​\n6.  INVESTMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's investments were comprised of the following (in millions)\n:\n​\nEquity Method Investments\nEquity method investments included investments in Signal Trading Systems, LLC (“Signal”), a\n50\n%\njoint venture with FlexTrade System, Inc. (“FlexTrade”) to develop and market PULSe, a multi-asset front-end order entry system. In 2020, the Company commenced an initiative to migrate PULSe, and its related activity to Cboe Silexx, LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. PULSe was decommissioned as of December 31, 2020, and the joint venture with FlexTrade was wound down during the first quarter of 2021. The Company concluded that the remaining investment in Signal had no future economic value and the remaining balance was written off as of March 31, 2021. The loss related to the write-off was included within acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\nOn October 31, 2021, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, became a limited partner of 7Ridge Investments 3 LP (“7Ridge Fund”) in connection with 7Ridge Fund’s planned acquisition of Trading Technologies International, Inc. (“Trading Technologies”). On December 13, 2021, the Company’s subsidiary provided its financial commitment to 7Ridge Fund, and on December 21, 2021, 7Ridge Fund completed the acquisition of Trading Technologies. Trading Technologies is a global provider of next-generation professional trading software, connectivity and data solutions. The Company is strategically aligned with Trading Technologies’ vision of delivering a leading trading, connectivity and data network to the global trading community.\nThe Company’s investment in the 7Ridge Fund, represents a nonconsolidated variable interest entity (“VIE”). The Company has determined that consolidation of the VIE is not required as the Company is not the primary beneficiary of the 7Ridge Fund, as it does not have controlling financial interest and lacks the ability to unilaterally remove the general partner, 7Ridge Investments 3 GP Limited, direct material strategic decisions, or dissolve the entity (i.e. the Company does not have unilateral substantive “kick-out” or “liquidation” rights).\n​\n111\nThe Company’s interest in the 7Ridge Fund investment is equal to the carrying value of the investment as of December 31, 2021, or\n$\n209.5\nmillion, which is included in investments within the consolidated balance sheets. The Company’s maximum loss exposure, in the unlikely event that all of the VIE’s assets become worthless, is limited to the carrying value of Company’s investment.\nOther Equity Investments\nThe carrying value of other equity investments is included in investments in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company accounts for these investments using the measurement alternative given the absence of readily determinable fair values for the respective investments and due to the Company’s inability to exercise significant influence over the investments based upon the respective ownership interests held. As of December 31, 2021, other equity investments primarily reflect a\n20\n%\ninvestment in OCC and minority investments in Eris Exchange Holdings, LLC, American Financial Exchange, LLC, and Cboe Vest Financial Group, Inc.\nIn January 2016, the Company, through its subsidiary Cboe Vest, LLC (“Cboe Vest”), acquired a majority of the outstanding equity of Vest, an asset investment manager focused on Target Outcome Investment strategies. The purchase price consisted of\n$\n18.9\nmillion in cash, reflecting payments of\n$\n14.9\nmillion to former stockholders and\n$\n4.0\nmillion to Vest for newly issued shares, and represented an ownership interest of\n60\n%\nresulting in the consolidation of Vest operations. The remaining\n40\n%\nnoncontrolling interest was held by the remaining Vest stockholders. The remaining Vest stockholders had a put option that could have been exercised to Vest and Vest had a call option that could have been exercised to the remaining stockholders. The put and\ncall options\ncould have been exercised after\nfive years\nthough they could have been accelerated by certain employment-related actions. The combination of the noncontrolling interest and a redemption feature resulted in a redeemable noncontrolling interest, which was classified outside of permanent equity on the consolidated balance sheet. The Company’s ownership interest decreased in August 2019 which resulted in the deconsolidation of Vest operations and the elimination of the redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nIn May 2020, Eris Exchange Holdings, LLC completed a restructuring transaction to spin out Eris Digital Holdings, LLC into a stand-alone entity. The restructuring qualifies as an exchange of ownership interest, though it required no additional consideration exchanged to execute the exchange of units. The restructuring did not result in a change in number of units owned by the Company or a substantial change in the Company’s ownership interest percentage.\nNo\ngain or loss is recognized as a result of the restructuring.\nAs discussed below, on October 19, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire all of the outstanding equity interests of Eris Digital Holdings, LLC. However, Eris Exchange Holdings, LLC is not a part of this transaction and the Company retains its minority equity ownership interest in Eris Exchange Holdings, LLC.\nIn August 2020, the Company recorded within acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income an impairment charge of\n$\n4.1\nmillion on its investment in AFX based on management’s assessment of the fair value of the investment.\nOn September 21, 2021, CurveGlobal Limited (“CurveGlobal”), a minority investment of the Company included within other equity investments, announced plans to wind down the company in January 2022. The Company concluded that the remaining investment in CurveGlobal had no future economic value, and thus, wrote off the investment as of September 30, 2021. CurveGlobal ceased operations on January 28, 2022. The loss related to the write-off was included within other (expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of income.\nAs announced on October 20, 2021, the Company plans to acquire the remaining interest in Eris Digital Holdings, LLC. The closing of the transaction is subject to regulatory review and other customary closing conditions. As a result, the timing of the closing is uncertain, but the Company presently anticipates a closing in the first half of 2022. See Item 7 (“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations”) for more information.\n​\n112\n7.  PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty and equipment consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\nDepreciation expense using the straight-line method was\n$\n33.5\nmillion,\n$\n26.8\nmillion and\n$\n24.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs a result of the Merger, there was a reduction in employee workspace needed in Chicago, which led to the decision to market for sale the headquarters location. The Company classified the associated land, building, and certain furniture and equipment of the headquarters location as held for sale, performed an impairment assessment, and ceased depreciation effective May 1, 2019, as the Company anticipated selling the property held for sale in less than twelve months. As of December 31, 2021, the headquarters location remains on the market for sale and management’s intent to sell the property is unchanged. However, due to the time elapsed since active marketing for sale of the building commenced, the Company has reclassified the property to held and used, effective May 1, 2021, and the building was once again subject to depreciation. The total value of the property classified as property held and used was\n$\n11.7\nmillion, which includes\n$\n2.3\nmillion of land and\n$\n9.4\nmillion of property and equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021. As a result of the headquarters location’s classification as held for sale during the second quarter of 2020, an impairment assessment was performed and an additional impairment charge of\n$\n8.1\nmillion was recorded in acquisition related costs within the Options segment in the accompanying consolidated statements of income.\n8.  CREDIT LOSSES\nCurrent expected credit losses are estimated for accounts receivable and certain notes receivable. The notes receivable included within other assets, net on the consolidated balance sheets primarily relate to the consolidated audit trail (“CAT”), which involves the creation of an audit trail that strives to enhance regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity in the U.S. markets through a phased implementation. The funding of the CAT is ultimately expected to be provided by both self-regulatory organizations (“SROs”) (which includes the Exchanges) and industry members; however, the funding to date has solely been provided by the SROs in exchange for promissory notes, which are expected to be repaid once fee filings and plan amendments associated with a funding model are approved by the SEC and such industry member fees are collected. Until those fees are collected, the SROs may continue to incur additional significant costs, including additional promissory notes to fund CAT operations. The allowance for notes receivable credit losses associated with the CAT are calculated using a probability of default methodology that is primarily based on various potential outcomes of the funding model proposals being discussed with the SEC. Accounts receivable represent amounts due from the Company’s member firms. The allowance for accounts receivable credit losses is calculated using an aging schedule.\nThe following represents the changes in allowance for credit losses for the year ended December 31, 2021 (in millions):\n​\n113\n9.  OTHER ASSETS, NET\nOther assets, net consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\nAmortization expense related to data processing software was\n$\n7.3\nmillion,\n$\n6.9\nmillion, and\n$\n13.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively\n.\n10.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS, NET\nThe following table presents the details of goodwill by segment (in millions)\n:\n​\nGoodwill has been allocated to specific reporting units for purposes of impairment testing - Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific and Global FX.\nNo\ngoodwill has been allocated to Futures. Goodwill impairment testing is performed annually in the fiscal fourth quarter or more frequently if conditions exist that indicate that the asset may be impaired.\nThe following table presents the details of the intangible assets (in millions):\n​\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, amortization expense was\n$\n126.6\nmillion,\n$\n124.8\nmillion and\n$\n138.6\nmillion, respectively. The estimated future amortization expense is\n$\n116.1\nmillion for 2022,\n$\n103.0\nmillion for 2023,\n$\n79.5\nmillion for 2024,\n$\n68.9\nmillion for 2025, and\n$\n61.5\nmillion for 2026.\n114\nThe following tables present the categories of intangible assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n11.  ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES\n​\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n12.  DEBT\nThe Company’s debt consisted of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\nAs described below in further detail, on June 25, 2021, the Company further amended the Term Loan Agreement (as defined below) to extend the maturity date from December 15, 2021 to December 15, 2023 and to allow for an additional draw of\n$\n110\nmillion, which the Company borrowed on June 25, 2021 in order to fund a portion of the acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific.\n​\n115\nTerm Loan Agreement\nOn March 22, 2018, the Company, as borrower, entered into a Term Loan Credit Agreement (the “Term Loan Agreement”) with Bank of America, N.A. (“Bank of America”), as administrative agent and initial lender, and the several banks and other financial institutions from time to time party thereto as lenders. Bank of America also acted as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner with respect to the Term Loan Agreement. The Term Loan Agreement provided for a senior unsecured term loan facility in an aggregate principal amount of\n$\n300\nmillion. The proceeds of the loan under the Term Loan Agreement were used to repay the\n$\n300\nmillion of outstanding indebtedness under the prior term loan agreement entered into on December 15, 2016.\nLoans under the Term Loan Agreement bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) periodically fixed for an interest period (as selected by the Company) of one, two, three or six months plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\n1.00\npercent per annum to\n1.50\npercent per annum or (ii) a daily floating rate based on the agent’s prime rate (subject to certain minimums based upon the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR) plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\nzero\npercent per annum to\n0.50\npercent per annum. The Company was required to pay an up-front fee of\n0.05\npercent to the agent for the entry into the Term Loan Agreement.\nOn May 29, 2020, the Company amended the Term Loan Agreement to, among other items, (i) permit liens on assets of the EuroCCP settlement and clearing business that secures indebtedness incurred in support of its settlement and clearing activities, and permit the Company’s subsidiaries to incur such indebtedness, provided that such amounts are repaid within 35 days; and (ii) provide that LIBOR, as used in the Term Loan Agreement, may be succeeded by one or more secured overnight financing rates (“SOFR”) published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York or another alternate benchmark rate giving due consideration to any evolving or then-existing convention for similar agreements.\nOn June 25, 2021, the Company further amended the Term Loan Agreement to, among other items, (i) extend the maturity date from December 15, 2021 to December 15, 2023; (ii) allow for an additional draw of\n$\n110\nmillion, which the Company borrowed on June 25, 2021 in order to fund a portion of the previously announced acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific; (iii) modify the applicable margin paid on the loans to\n65\nbasis points regardless of the Company’s debt rating; (iv) add LIBOR replacement provisions, generally transitioning to a hardwired approach based on SOFR, with certain adjustments as further described in the amendment; (v) increase the amount of indebtedness certain subsidiaries may incur from the greater of\n$\n250\nmillion and\n35\n%\nconsolidated EBITDA for four consecutive quarters to the greater of\n$\n350\nmillion and\n35\n%\nconsolidated EBITDA for four consecutive quarters; (vi) allow the Company to increase the maximum permitted consolidated leverage ratio to\n4.00\nto 1.00 (from\n3.50\nto 1.00) for four consecutive fiscal quarters following certain acquisitions, provided this increase may be made only once; and (vii) modify certain other provisions to be consistent with the Company’s Revolving Credit Agreement (as defined below).\nThe Term Loan Agreement, which matures on December 15, 2023, contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of its type, including financial covenants, events of default, including cross-defaults from the Company’s other indebtedness, and indemnification provisions in favor of the lenders thereunder. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company’s subsidiaries and fundamental changes, subject to certain exceptions in each case. The financial covenants require the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than\n4.00\nto 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than\n3.50\nto 1.00. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nSenior Notes\nOn January 12, 2017, the Company entered into an indenture (the “Indenture”), by and between the Company and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, in connection with the issuance of\n$\n650\nmillion aggregate principal amount of the Company’s\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes due 2027 (“\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes”). The form and terms of the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes were established pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate, dated as of January 12, 2017, supplementing the Indenture. The Company used a portion of the net proceeds from the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes to fund, in part, the Merger, including the payment of related fees and expenses and the repayment of Bats’ existing indebtedness, and the remainder for general corporate purposes. The\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes mature on January 12, 2027 and bear interest at the rate of\n3.650\n%\nper annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on January 12 and July 12 of each year, commencing July 12, 2017.\n116\nOn December 15, 2020, the Company issued\n$\n500\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes due 2030 (\"\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes\" and, together with the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes, the \"Senior Notes\"). The form and terms of the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes were established pursuant to an Officer’s Certificate, dated as of December 15, 2020, supplementing the Indenture. The Company used the net proceeds from the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes to finance the acquisition of BIDS Trading, repay a portion of amounts outstanding under the term loan facility and all outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility and the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include the financing of future acquisitions or the repayment of other outstanding indebtedness. The\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes mature on December 15, 2030 and bear interest at the rate of\n1.625\n%\nper annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on June 15 and December 15 of each year, commencing June 15, 2021.\nThe Senior Notes are unsecured obligations of the Company and rank equally with all of the Company’s other existing and future unsecured, senior indebtedness, but are effectively junior to the Company’s secured indebtedness, to the extent of the value of the assets securing such indebtedness, and will be structurally subordinated to the secured and unsecured indebtedness of the Company’s subsidiaries.\nThe Company has the option to redeem some or all of the Senior Notes, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at the redemption prices set forth in the applicable Officer’s Certificate. The Company may also be required to offer to repurchase the Senior Notes upon the occurrence of a Change of Control Triggering Event (as such term is defined in the applicable Officer’s Certificate) at a repurchase price equal to\n101\n%\nof the aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes to be repurchased.\nIndenture\nUnder the Indenture, the Company may issue debt securities, which includes the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes and the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes, at any time and from time to time, in one or more series without limitation on the aggregate principal amount. The Indenture governing the\n3.650\n%\nSenior Notes and the\n1.625\n%\nSenior Notes contains customary restrictions, including a limitation that restricts the Company’s ability and the ability of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries to create or incur secured debt. Such Indenture also limits certain sale and leaseback transactions and contains customary events of default. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nRevolving Credit Agreement\nOn December 21, 2020, the Company, as borrower, entered into an Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the “Revolving Credit Agreement”), which amended and restated the prior revolving credit agreement, with Bank of America, N.A., as administrative agent and as swing line lender, certain lenders named therein (the “Revolving Lenders”), BOFA Securities, Inc., as sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner and certain syndication agents named therein (\"Syndication Agents\").\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement provides for a senior unsecured\n$\n250\nmillion\nthree-year\nrevolving credit facility (the “Revolving Credit Facility”) that includes a\n$\n25\nmillion swing line sub-facility. The Company may also, subject to the agreement of the applicable lenders, increase the commitments under the Revolving Credit Facility by up to\n$\n100\nmillion, for a total of\n$\n350\nmillion. Subject to specified conditions, the Company may designate\none\nor more of its subsidiaries as additional borrowers under the Revolving Credit Agreement provided that the Company guarantees all borrowings and other obligations of any such subsidiaries under the Revolving Credit Agreement. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\nsubsidiaries were designated as additional borrowers.\nFunds borrowed under the Revolving Credit Agreement may be used to fund working capital and for other general corporate purposes, including the making of any acquisitions the Company may pursue in the ordinary course of its business. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021,\n$\n250\nmillion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nLoans under the Revolving Credit Agreement will bear interest, at the Company’s option, at either (i) LIBOR plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\n0.875\npercent per annum to\n1.50\npercent per annum or (ii) a daily floating rate based on the agent’s prime rate (subject to certain minimums based upon the federal funds effective rate or LIBOR) plus a margin (based on the Company’s public debt ratings) ranging from\nzero\npercent per annum to\n0.50\npercent per annum. The Revolving Credit Agreement includes a mechanism to replace LIBOR with an alternate benchmark rate that includes the forward-looking term rate for any interest period that is based on the SOFR\n117\npublished by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as may be adjusted pursuant to the terms of the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nSubject to certain conditions stated in the Revolving Credit Agreement, the Company and any subsidiaries designated as additional borrowers may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility at any time during the term of the Revolving Credit Agreement. The Revolving Credit Agreement will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on December 21, 2023, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of the Company or, if an event of default occurs, by the Revolving Lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events). The Revolving Credit Agreement contains customary representations, warranties and affirmative and negative covenants for facilities of its type, including financial covenants, events of default and indemnification provisions in favor of the Revolving Lenders. The negative covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens, the incurrence of indebtedness by the Company’s subsidiaries and fundamental changes, subject to certain exceptions in each case. The financial covenants require the Company to meet a quarterly financial test with respect to a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than\n4.00\nto 1.00 and a maximum consolidated leverage ratio of not greater than\n3.50\nto 1.00; provided that the consolidated leverage ratio may, subject to certain triggering events set forth in the Revolving Credit Agreement, be increased to\n4.00\nto 1.00 for four consecutive fiscal quarters. At December 31, 2021, the Company was in compliance with these covenants.\nEuroCCP Credit Facility\nOn July 1, 2020, EuroCCP, as borrower, the Company, as guarantor, entered into a Facility Agreement (the “Facility” or “EuroCCP Credit Facility”) with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Designated Activity Company, as co-ordinator, facility agent, lender, sole lead arranger and sole bookrunner, Citibank N.A., as security agent, and certain other lenders named therein.\nThe Facility provides for a\n€\n1.5\nbillion committed syndicated multicurrency revolving and swingline credit facility (i) that is available to be drawn by EuroCCP (as borrower) towards (a) financing unsettled amounts in connection with the settlement of transactions in securities and other items processed through EuroCCP’s clearing system and (b) financing any other liability or liquidity requirement of EuroCCP incurred in the operation of its clearing system and (ii) under which the scheduled interest and fees on borrowings (but not the principal amount of any borrowings) are guaranteed by the Company. Subject to certain conditions, EuroCCP is able to increase the commitments under the Facility by up to\n€\n500\nmillion, to a total of\n€\n2.0\nbillion.\nBorrowings under the Facility are secured by cash, eligible government bonds and eligible equity assets deposited by EuroCCP into secured accounts. In addition, EuroCCP must ensure that at all times the aggregate of (a) each clearing participant’s contribution to the relevant clearing fund, (b) each clearing participant’s margin amount and (c) any cash equities purchased using the proceeds of the assets described in (a) and (b), less the amount of any such clearing participant contribution, margin amount or cash equities which have been transferred to (or secured in favor of) any provider of settlement or custody services to EuroCCP, is not less than\n€\n500\nmillion. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\nborrowings were outstanding under the Facility. Accordingly, at December 31, 2021,\n€\n1.5\nbillion of borrowing capacity was available for the purposes permitted by the Facility.\nBorrowings under the Facility’s revolving loans and non-U.S. dollar swingline loans bear interest at the relevant floating base rate plus a margin of\n1.75\npercent per annum and (subject to certain conditions) borrowings under the Facility’s U.S. dollar swingline loans bear interest as the higher of the relevant agent’s prime commercial lending rate for U.S. dollars and\n0.5\npercent per annum over the federal funds effective rate. A commitment fee of\n0.30\npercent per annum is payable on the unused and uncalled amount of the Facility during the availability period.\nSubject to certain conditions stated in the Facility, EuroCCP may borrow, prepay and reborrow amounts under the Facility at any time during the term of the Facility. The Facility will terminate and all amounts owing thereunder will be due and payable on\n364 days\nfrom the date of the agreement, unless the commitments are terminated earlier, either at the request of EuroCCP or, if an event of default occurs, by the Lenders (or automatically in the case of certain bankruptcy-related events).\nThe Facility contains customary representations, warranties and covenants for facilities of its type, including events of default of the Company and EuroCCP and indemnification provisions in favor of the Lenders. In particular, the covenants include restrictions regarding the incurrence of liens by EuroCCP and its subsidiaries, and an event of default will be triggered if EuroCCP ceases its business, subject to certain exceptions in each case. There is also a requirement for the net worth of (a) the Company to be no less than\n$\n1.75\nbillion on the date of each drawdown and delivery of compliance\n118\ncertificates and (b) EuroCCP to be the higher of\n€\n24\nmillion and any such amount required for EuroCCP to meet minimum liquidity regulations under applicable regulation at all times. At December 31, 2021, the Company and EuroCCP were in compliance with these covenants.\nOn July 1, 2021, the Facility was amended and restated to, among other items: (i) extend the term of the Facility until June 30, 2022; (ii) update benchmark rates for U.S. dollar swingline loans and alternative term rates for revolving loans; (iii) remove references to LIBOR and clarified procedures to calculate interest rates; (iv) reduce the minimum tangible net worth requirement from\n€\n24\nmillion to\n€\n20\nmillion; (v) include a new tranche in the revolving and swingline facilities to increase access to certain currencies; (vi) update the borrowing base calculations to more accurately reflect the collateral held by EuroCCP; and (vii) modify certain other provisions to incorporate updates in applicable laws and regulations.\nLoan and Notes Payments and Contractual Interest\nThe future expected loan repayments related to the Term Loan Agreement and the Senior Notes as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (in millions):\n​\nInterest expense recognized on the Term Loan Agreement, the Senior Notes, and the Revolving Credit Agreement is included in interest expense, net in the consolidated statements of income. The Company is also obligated to pay commitment fees under the terms of the Facility and Revolving Credit Agreement which are also included in interest expense, net.\nInterest expense, net recognized in the consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n13.  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET\nThe following represents the changes in accumulated other comprehensive income, net by component (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n14.  CLEARING OPERATIONS\nEuroCCP is a European equities central counterparty that provides post-trade services to stock exchanges, MTFs  over-the-counter (“OTC”) equities trades, and an equity index derivatives exchange. EuroCCP clears equities from\neighteen\nEuropean markets and the United States, as well as Depositary Receipts, ETFs, and exchange traded\n119\ncurrencies (“ETCs”). In September, 2021 EuroCCP began clearing equity index derivatives for\nsix\nEuropean markets. Through a novation process, EuroCCP becomes the buyer for every seller and the seller for every buyer, thereby protecting clearing participants from counterparty risk and allowing the settlement of trades in the event of a clearing participant default.\nEuroCCP only assumes the guarantor role if it has an equal and offsetting claim against a clearing participant. For the period ended December 31, 2021, there have been no events of default for which a liability is required to be recognized in accordance with GAAP.\nClearing Participant Deposits\nEuroCCP generally requires all clearing participants to deposit collateral to help mitigate EuroCCP’s exposure to credit risk in the event that a clearing participant fails to meet a financial or contractual obligation.\nMargin Deposits\nMargin deposits, which are predominately in the form of cash and cash equivalents, are deposits made by each clearing participant to EuroCCP to cover some or all of the credit risk of its failure to fulfill its obligations in the trade. EuroCCP maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin deposits. Substantially all risks and rewards of margin deposit ownership, including net interest income, belong to EuroCCP and are recorded in other revenue on the consolidated statements of income. In the event of a default, EuroCCP can access the defaulting participant’s margin deposits to cover the defaulting participant’s losses. For more information, see “Default and Liquidity Waterfalls” below.\nClearing Funds\nThe clearing fund mutualizes the risk of default among all clearing participants. Depending on their membership, clearing participants contribute to the cash-equity and/or derivatives segment of the clearing fund. Although the entire clearing fund is available to cover potential losses in the event that the margin deposits and the clearing fund deposits of a defaulting clearing participant are inadequate to fulfill that clearing participant’s outstanding financial obligations, the clearing fund first uses the product class segment of the Clearing Fund in which the defaulting participants was active (see Default and Liquidity Waterfalls below). In the event of a default, EuroCCP is generally required to liquidate the defaulting clearing participant’s open positions. To the extent that the positions remain open, EuroCCP is required to assume the defaulting clearing participant’s obligations related to the open positions. Clearing participants are required to make contributions to the clearing fund that are proportional to their risk exposure in the form of cash or non-cash contributions, which generally consist of highly liquid securities.\nInteroperability Fund\nFor the cash equity business line, EuroCCP has entered into interoperable arrangements with\ntwo\nother central counterparties (“CCPs”). Under these arrangements, margin is paid to, and received from, the other CCPs. The interoperability fund consists of collateral pledged by EuroCCP to the other interoperable CCPs, to cover margin calls EuroCCP received from other interoperable CCPs. For EuroCCP, the collateral pledged by the clearing participants is maintained in an interoperability fund designated account. EuroCCP does not have any economic interest or ownership in the collateral; therefore, these balances are not included in the consolidated balance sheet.\n120\nThe following tables present the Company’s total clearing participant deposits as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in millions)\n:\n​\n​\n​\nDefault and Liquidity Waterfalls\nThe default waterfall is the priority order in which the capital resources are expected to be utilized in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing participant’s collateral would not be sufficient to cover the cost to liquidate its portfolio. If a default occurs and the defaulting clearing participant’s collateral, including margin deposits and clearing fund deposits, are depleted, then additional capital is utilized in the following order:\nIn addition to the default waterfall, the liquidity waterfall is the priority order in which the liquidity resources are expected to be utilized for EuroCCP’s ordinary course business operations and in situations when additional liquidity resources and liquidity measures may be activated in case of a potential liquidity shortfall. Liquidity, intraday or overnight, is mainly required for securities settlement. In ordinary course business circumstances, liquidity resources include the collateral directly deposited with EuroCCP, FX swap arrangements, and reverse repurchase agreements, as well as the use of the Facility\n.\n15.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT\nFair value is the price that would be received upon the sale of an asset or paid upon the transfer of a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and in the principal or most advantageous market for that asset or liability. The fair value should be calculated based on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, not on assumptions specific to the entity. In addition, the fair value of liabilities should include consideration of non-performance risk, including the Company’s own credit risk.\nThe Company applied ASC 820\n—\nFair Value Measurement\n, which provides guidance for using fair value to measure assets and liabilities by defining fair value and establishing the framework for measuring fair value. ASC 820 applies to financial and nonfinancial instruments that are measured and reported on a fair value basis. The three-level hierarchy of fair value measurements is based on whether the inputs to those measurements are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the\n121\nCompany’s market assumptions. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available and consists of the following levels:\nThe Company has included a tabular disclosure for financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables present the Company’s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\n​\nThe following is a description of the Company’s valuation methodologies used for instruments measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\nFinancial Investments\n​\nFinancial investments consist of highly liquid U.S. Treasury securities and marketable securities held in a trust for the Company’s non-qualified retirement and benefit plans, also referred to as deferred compensation plan assets. The deferred compensation plan assets have an equal and offsetting deferred compensation plan liability based on the value of the deferred compensation plan assets. These securities are valued by obtaining feeds from a number of live data sources, including active market makers and inter-dealer brokers and therefore categorized as Level 1. No material adjustments were made to the carrying value of financial investments for the period ended December 31, 2021. See Note 17 (“Employee Benefit Plans”) for more information.\n122\nContingent Consideration Liabilities\nIn connection with the acquisitions of Hanweck, MATCHNow, and Chi-X Asia Pacific, as well as the acquisition of assets of FT Options and Trade Alert, the Company entered into contingent consideration arrangements with the former owners. The total fair value of the liabilities at December 31, 2021 was\n$\n70.5\nmillion. That value is based on the Company’s estimate of the likelihood that certain performance targets in the respective acquisition agreements are expected to be accomplished. In connection with the contingent consideration arrangements, the Company paid a total of\n$\n9.1\nmillion in contingent consideration to Hanweck, FT Options, Trade Alert and Chi-X Asia Pacific in 2021. Because the fair value measurements relating to the contingent consideration liabilities are subject to management judgment, measurement uncertainty is inherent in the valuation of the contingent consideration liabilities as of the reporting date. Based on the recorded balance of the liabilities, any measurement uncertainty related to this Level 3 measurement is immaterial as of December 31, 2021.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nCertain assets, such as goodwill and intangible assets, are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. For goodwill, the process involves using a market approach and income approach (using discounted estimated cash flows) to determine the fair value of each reporting unit on a stand-alone basis. That fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit, including its recorded goodwill. In connection with the annual impairment evaluation of goodwill and indefinite life intangibles, impairment is considered to have occurred if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than the carrying value of the reporting unit. For the intangible assets, the process also involves using a discounted cash flow method to determine the fair value of each intangible asset. Impairment is considered to have occurred if the fair value of the intangible asset is lower than its carrying value. These measurements are considered Level 3 and these assets are recognized at fair value if they are deemed to be impaired.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values that are valued using the measurement alternative are measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis. See Note 6 (“Investments”) for more information. During the year ended December 31, 2021, no observable transactions or impairments materially impacted the measurements of the investments accounted for as other equity investments.\nFair Value of Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for certain assets and liabilities held by the Company, with the exception of debt which is presented at its carrying value, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\n123\n​\nCertain financial assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, income tax receivable, accounts payable and Section 31 fees payable, are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis, but the carrying values approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature.\nDebt\nThe debt balance consists of fixed rate, Senior Notes and a floating rate, Term Loan Agreement. The fair values of the Senior Notes are classified as Level 2 under the fair value hierarchy and are estimated using prevailing market quotes. The fair value of the Term Loan Agreement was determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis and is considered a Level 2 measurement.\nThe fair values of the Company’s debt obligations for 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n​\nInformation on Level 3 Financial Liabilities\nThe following table sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Company’s Level 3 financial liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n​\n16.  SEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company reports\nfive\nbusiness segments: Options, North American Equities, Europe and Asia Pacific, Futures, and Global FX, which is reflective of how the Company's chief operating decision-maker reviews and operates the business, as discussed in Note 1 (“Nature of Operations”). Segment performance is primarily evaluated based on operating income (loss). The Company’s chief operating decision-maker does not use segment-level assets or income\n124\nand expenses below operating income (loss) as key performance metrics; therefore, such information is not presented below. The Company has aggregated all of its corporate costs, as well as other business ventures, within the Corporate Items and Eliminations totals based on the decision that those activities should not be used to evaluate the operating performance of the segments; however, operating expenses that relate to activities of a specific segment have been allocated to that segment.\nOptions.\nThe Options segment includes options on market indices (“index options”), as well as on the stocks of individual corporations (“equity options”), and options on ETPs, such as exchange-traded funds (“ETFs”) and exchange-traded notes (“ETNs”), which are “multi-listed” options and listed on a non-exclusive basis. These options are eligible to trade on Cboe Options, C2, BZX, EDGX, and other U.S. national security exchanges. Cboe Options is the Company’s primary options market and offers trading in listed options through a single system that integrates electronic trading and traditional open outcry trading on the Cboe Options trading floor in Chicago. C2 Options, BZX Options, and EDGX Options are all-electronic options exchanges, and typically operate with different market models and fee structures than Cboe Options. The Options segment also includes applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary options market data, index licensing, and access and capacity services.\nNorth American Equities.\nThe North American Equities segment includes listed U.S. equities and ETP transaction services that occur on fully electronic exchanges owned and operated by BZX, BYX, EDGX, and EDGA, equities transactions that occur on the BIDS Trading platform, and Canadian equities and other transaction services that occur on or through the MATCHNow ATS. The North American Equities segment also includes ETP listings on BZX, the Cboe Global Markets, Inc. common stock listing, applicable market data revenue generated from the consolidated tape plans, the licensing of proprietary equities market data, routing services, and access and capacity services.\nEurope and Asia Pacific.\nThe Europe and Asia Pacific segment includes the pan-European listed equities and derivatives transaction services, ETPs, exchange-traded commodities, and international depository receipts that are hosted on MTFs operated by Cboe Europe Equities (Cboe Europe and Cboe NL) and Cboe Europe Derivatives (“CEDX”). It also includes the ETP listings business on RMs and clearing activities of EuroCCP, as well as the equities transaction services of Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan, each operators of trading venues in Australia and Japan. This segment was previously referred to as the European Equities segment but was updated to the Europe segment in the first quarter of 2021 as a result of the launch of Cboe Europe Derivatives, a pan-European derivatives platform in September 2021. The segment was subsequently updated to Europe and Asia Pacific to reflect the acquisition of Chi-X Asia Pacific in July 2021. Cboe Europe operates lit and dark books, a periodic auctions book, and a Large-in-Scale (“LIS”) trading negotiation facility for UK symbols. Cboe NL, launched in October 2019 and based in Amsterdam, operates similar business functionality to that offered by Cboe Europe, and provides for trading only in European Economic Area (“EEA”) symbols. The new Cboe Europe Derivatives venue offers futures and options based on Cboe Europe equity indices. This segment also includes Cboe Europe, Cboe NL, CEDX, Cboe Australia and Cboe Japan revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\nFutures.\nThe Futures segment includes transaction services provided by the Company’s fully electronic futures exchange, CFE, which includes offerings for trading of VIX futures and other futures products, the licensing of proprietary market data, as well as access and capacity services.\nGlobal FX.\nThe Global FX segment includes institutional FX trading services that occur on the Cboe FX fully electronic trading platform, non-deliverable forward FX transactions (“NDFs”) offered for execution on Cboe SEF and Cboe Swiss, as well as revenue generated from the licensing of proprietary market data and from access and capacity services.\n​\n125\nSummarized financial data of reportable segments was as follows (in millions):\n​\n​\n​\n​\n17.  EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nEligible U.S. employees, which includes BIDS U.S. employees as of January 1, 2021, are eligible to participate in the Cboe Options SMART Plan (“SMART Plan”). The SMART Plan is a defined contribution plan, which is qualified under Internal Revenue Code Section 401(k). In addition, eligible employees may participate in the Supplemental Employee Retirement Plan, Executive Retirement Plan and Deferred Compensation Plan. Effective January 1, 2017, the Executive Retirement Plan is closed to new executive officers and employees. Each plan is a defined contribution plan that is non-qualified under the Internal Revenue Code. The Deferred Compensation Plan assets, held in a trust, are subject to the claims of general creditors of the Company and totaled\n$\n28.0\nmillion at December 31, 2021. Although the value of the plans are recorded in financial investments on the consolidated balance sheets, there are equal and offsetting liabilities in other non-current liabilities. The investment results of these plans have no impact on net income as the investment results are recorded in equal amounts to both other expense, net and compensation and benefits expense in the consolidated statements of income. The Company contributed\n$\n11.8\nmillion,\n$\n10.5\nmillion, and\n$\n11.3\nmillion to the defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nEligible employees outside of the U.S., which includes employees of Cboe Europe, EuroCCP, MATCHNow, BIDS, and Chi-X Asia Pacific are eligible to participate in various employee-selected stakeholder contribution plans or plans covered by local jurisdictions or by applicable laws. The Company’s contribution amounted to\n$\n2.3\nmillion,\n$\n1.6\nmillion, and\n$\n0.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. This expense is included in compensation and benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\n18.  REGULATORY CAPITAL\nAs broker-dealers registered with the SEC, Cboe Trading and BIDS Trading are subject to the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule (“Rule 15c3-1”), which requires the maintenance of minimum net capital, as defined therein. The SEC’s requirement also provides that equity capital may not be withdrawn or a cash dividend paid if certain minimum net capital requirements are not met. Cboe Trading and BIDS Trading compute the net capital requirements under the basic method provided for in Rule 15c3-1. As of December 31, 2021, Cboe Trading and BIDS Trading were required to maintain net capital equal to the greater of\n6.67\n%\nof aggregate indebtedness items, as defined, or\n$\n0.1\nmillion.\nAs entities regulated by the FCA, Cboe Europe is subject to the Financial Resource Requirement (“FRR”) and Cboe Chi-X Europe is subject to the Capital Resources Requirement (“CRR”). As a RIE, Cboe Europe computes its FRR in accordance with its Financial Risk Assessment, as agreed by the FCA.\nIn accordance with the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive of the FCA requirements, Cboe Chi-X Europe computes its CRR as the greater of the base requirement of\n$\n0.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, or the summation of the credit risk, market risk and fixed overheads requirements, as defined. Cboe Chi-X Europe is currently dormant having ceased offering its routing service in November 2018.\nOn March 8, 2019, Cboe NL received approval from the Dutch Ministry of Finance to operate a RM, a MTF, and an approved publication arrangement in the Netherlands. As a RM, Cboe NL is subject to minimum capital requirements, as established by the Dutch Ministry of Finance in the license dated March 8, 2019.\n126\nEuroCCP was granted authorization under European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”) by the National Competent Authority, DNB. EuroCCP is required by the EMIR, to maintain a minimum amount of capital to reflect an estimate of the capital required to wind down or restructure the activities of the clearinghouse, cover operational, legal and business risks and to reserve capital to meet credit, counterparty and market risks not covered by the clearing participants’ collateral and clearing funds.\nThe Investment Industry Regulatory Organization of Canada (“IIROC”) sets and monitors regulatory capital requirements for MATCHNow to protect its clients and counterparties. MATCHNow is required to maintain a prescribed minimum level of risk adjusted capital in accordance with such requirements as IIROC may from time to time prescribe.\nAs a designated contract market regulated by the CFTC, CFE is required to meet\ntwo\ncapital adequacy tests: (i) its financial resources must be equal to at least twelve months of its projected operating costs and (ii) its unencumbered, liquid financial assets, which may include a line of credit, must be equal to at least six months of its projected operating costs. The amounts presented below represent the greater of the\ntwo\ncapital adequacy requirements.\nAs a swap execution facility regulated by the CFTC, Cboe SEF is required to meet\ntwo\ncapital adequacy tests: (i) its financial resources must exceed at least twelve months of its projected operating costs and (ii) its unencumbered, liquid financial assets must be equal to the greater of: (a) three months of projected operating costs or (b) its projected wind-down costs. The amounts presented below represent the greater of the\ntwo\ncapital adequacy requirements.\nThe following table presents the Company’s subsidiaries with regulatory capital requirements discussed above, as well as the actual and minimum regulatory capital requirements of the subsidiary as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):\n​\nCboe Australia is regulated by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (“ASIC”). Cboe Australia is required to maintain sufficient financial resources to operate the market properly in accordance with Section 794A(d) of the Corporations Act, which Cboe Australia satisfies by maintaining a prudent cash reserve, which must be equal to at least six months of its projected operating expenses. As of December 31, 2021, Cboe Australia holds\n$\n4.4\nmillion in cash deposits to meet this requirement.\n​\nCboe Japan is regulated by the Japanese Financial Services Agency (“JFSA”) and the Japan Securities Dealers Association (“JSDA”). Cboe Japan is required to maintain a minimum level of regulatory capital ratio of\n120\n%\nin accordance with such requirements prescribed by the JFSA and JSDA. As of December 31, 2021, Cboe Japan had a regulatory capital ratio of\n273\n%\n.\n19.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nStock-based compensation is based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant, which is recognized over the related service period, net of actual forfeitures. The service period is the period over which the related service is performed, which is generally the same as the vesting period. Vesting may be accelerated for certain officers and employees as a result of attaining certain age and service-based requirements in the Company’s long-term incentive plan and award agreements.\nThe Company recognized stock-based compensation expense of\n$\n26.6\nmillion,\n$\n21.7\nmillion, and\n$\n21.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Stock-based compensation expense is included in compensation and benefits and acquisition-related costs in the consolidated statements of income.\n127\nThe activity in the Company's stock options and restricted stock, consisting of restricted stock awards (“RSAs”), restricted stock units (“RSUs”), and performance-based restricted stock units (“PSUs”), was as follows:\nStock Options\nSummary stock option activity is presented below:\n​\n​\nAll outstanding stock options were exercised during the year ended December 31, 2020. The total intrinsic value of stock options exercised was\n$\n0.9\nmillion and\n$\n26.0\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRSAs and RSUs\nThe following table summarizes RSA and RSU activity during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n​\n​\nRSAs granted to non-employee members of the Board of Directors have a\none-year\nvesting period and vesting accelerates upon the occurrence of a change in control of the Company. Unvested portions of the RSAs will be forfeited if the director leaves the Board of Directors prior to the applicable vesting date. The RSAs have voting rights and entitle the holder to receive dividends.\nRSUs entitle the holder to\none\nshare of common stock upon vesting, typically vest over a\nthree year\nperiod, and vesting accelerates upon the occurrence of a change in control or a termination of employment following a change in control or in the event of a participant’s earlier death or disability. Vesting will also accelerate upon a qualified retirement, where applicable and permitted. Where applicable and permitted, qualified retirement eligibility occurs once achieving\n55\nyears of age and\n10\nyears of service for grants awarded in and after 2017. Unvested RSUs will be forfeited if the officer, or employee leaves the Company prior to the applicable vesting date, except in limited circumstances. The RSUs have no voting rights but entitle the holder to receive dividend equivalents.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, to satisfy employees’ tax obligations upon the vesting of restricted stock, the Company purchased\n53,929\nshares of common stock totaling\n$\n5.3\nmillion as the result of the vesting of\n149,071\nshares of restricted stock.\n128\nPSUs\nThe following table summarizes restricted stock units contingent upon achievement of performance conditions, also known as PSUs, activity during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n​\n​\nPSUs include awards related to earnings per share during the performance period as well as awards related to total shareholder return during the performance period. The Company used the Monte Carlo valuation model method to estimate the fair value of the total shareholder return PSUs which incorporated the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate (\n0.15\n)%,\nthree-year\nvolatility (\n31.8\n)% and\nthree-year\ncorrelation with S&P 500 Index (\n0.51\n). Each of these performance shares has a performance condition under which the number of units ultimately awarded will vary from\n0\n%\nto\n200\n%\nof the original grant, with each unit representing the contingent right to receive\none\nshare of the Company’s common stock. The vesting period for the PSUs contingent on the achievement of performance conditions is\nthree years\n. For each of the performance awards, the PSUs will be settled in shares of the Company’s common stock following vesting of the PSU assuming that the participant has been continuously employed during the vesting period, subject to acceleration in the event of a change in control of the Company, or a termination of employment following a change in control, or in the event of a participant’s earlier death or disability. Participants have no voting rights with respect to the PSUs until the issuance of the shares of common stock. Dividends are accrued by the Company and will be paid once the PSUs contingent on the achievement of performance conditions vest.\nIn the year ended December 31, 2021, to satisfy employees’ tax obligations upon the vesting of performance stock, the Company purchased\n9,982\nshares of common stock totaling\n$\n0.9\nmillion as the result of the vesting of\n29,468\nshares of performance stock.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were\n$\n25.5\nmillion in total unrecognized compensation costs related to restricted stock, restricted stock units, and performance stock units. These costs are expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn May 2018, the Company’s stockholders approved an Employee Stock Purchase Plan, (“ESPP”), under which a total of\n750,000\nshares of the Company’s common stock will be made available for purchase to employees. The ESPP is a broad-based plan that permits employees to contribute up to\n10\n%\nof wages and base salary to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a discount, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service limitations. Under the ESPP, a participant may not purchase more than a maximum of\n312\nshares of the Company’s common stock during any single offering period. No participant may accrue options to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock at a rate that exceeds\n$\n25,000\nin fair market value of the Company’s common stock (determined at the time such options are granted) for each calendar year in which such rights are outstanding at any time. The exercise price per share of common stock shall be\n90\n%\n(for eligible U.S. employees) or\n85\n%\n(for eligible international employees) of the lesser of the fair value of the stock on the first day of the applicable offering period or the applicable exercise date.\n129\nThe Company records compensation expense over the offering period related to the discount that is given to employees, which totaled\n$\n0.4\nmillion,\n$\n0.3\nmillion, and\n$\n0.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021,\n655,078\nshares were reserved for future issuance under the ESPP\n.\n20.  EQUITY\nCommon Stock\n​\nThe Company’s common stock is listed on Cboe BZX under the trading symbol CBOE. As of December 31, 2021,\n325,000,000\nshares of the Company’s common stock were authorized,\n$\n0.01\npar value, and\n108,159,319\nand\n106,646,498\nshares were issued and outstanding, respectively. The holders of common stock are entitled to\none\nvote per share.\nCommon Stock in Treasury, at Cost\n​\nThe Company accounts for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method with the shares of stock repurchased reflected as a reduction to Cboe stockholders’ equity and included in common stock in treasury, at cost in the consolidated balance sheets. Shares repurchased under the Company’s share repurchase program are retired or they are available to be redistributed. When treasury shares are redistributed, they are recorded at the average cost of the treasury shares acquired. When treasury shares are retired, they are removed from the common stock in treasury balance. The Company held\n1,512,821\nand\n18,699,034\nshares of common stock in treasury as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nIn December 2021, the Board of Directors approved the retirement of\n18,072,129\nshares of treasury stock. These shares represent shares that were repurchased as part of the Company’s share repurchase program since inception through October 2021. The retirement is recorded as a decrease to treasury stock, common stock, and additional paid in capital on the consolidated balance sheets.\nShare Repurchase Program\n​\nIn 2011, the Board of Directors approved an initial authorization for the Company to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock of\n$\n100\nmillion and approved additional authorizations of\n$\n100\nmillion in each of 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015 and 2016,\n$\n250\nmillion in each of 2018, 2019 and 2020, and\n$\n200\nmillion in February 2021, for a total authorization of\n$\n1.6\nbillion. The Company expects to fund repurchases primarily through the use of existing cash balances. The program permits the Company to purchase shares, through a variety of methods, including in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions, in accordance with applicable securities laws. It does not obligate the Company to make any repurchases at any specific time or situation.\nUnder the program, for the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased\n822,005\nshares of common stock at an average cost per share of\n$\n98.82\n, totaling\n$\n81.3\nmillion. Since inception of the program through December 31, 2021, the Company has repurchased\n18,072,129\nshares of common stock at an average cost per share of\n$\n68.12\n, totaling\n$\n1.2\nbillion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had\n$\n318.9\nmillion of availability remaining under its existing share repurchase authorizations.\n​\n130\nThe table below shows the repurchased shares of common stock under the Company’s share repurchase program during the periods presented as follows:\n​\n​\nPurchase of Common Stock from Employees\n​\nThe Company purchased\n63,911\nand\n120,552\nshares that were not part of the publicly announced share repurchase authorization from employees for an average price paid per share of\n$\n97.19\nand\n$\n117.98\nduring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These shares consisted of shares retained to cover payroll withholding taxes or option costs in connection with the vesting of restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, performance share awards, and stock option exercises.\n​\nPreferred Stock\n​\nThe Company has authorized the issuance of\n20,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value\n$\n0.01\nper share, issuable from time to time in one or more series. For the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, the Company had\nno\nshares of preferred stock issued or\noutstanding\n.\n​\nDividends\n​\nDuring the year ended\nDecember 31, 2021\n, the Company declared and paid cash dividends per share of\n$\n1.80\n,\nfor an aggregate payout of\n$\n193.3\nmillion. During the year ended\nDecember 31, 2020\n, the Company declared and paid cash dividends per share of\n$\n1.56\n, for an aggregate payout of\n$\n170.6\nmillion.\nEach share of common stock, including RSAs, RSUs, and PSUs, is entitled to receive dividend and dividend equivalents, respectively, if, as and when declared by the Board of Directors of the Company. The Company’s expectation is to continue to pay dividends. The decision to pay a dividend, however, remains within the discretion of the Company’s Board of Directors and may be affected by various factors, including earnings, financial condition, capital requirements, level of indebtedness and other considerations the Board of Directors deems relevant. Future debt obligations and statutory provisions, among other things, may limit, or in some cases prohibit, the Company’s ability to pay dividends.\nAs a holding company, the Company’s ability to declare and continue to pay dividends in the future with respect to its common stock will also be dependent upon the ability of its subsidiaries to pay dividends to it under applicable corporate law\n.\n131\n21.  INCOME TAXES\nNet deferred tax assets and liabilities consist of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n​\nThe Company provides a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets if, based on management’s assessment of historical and projected future operating results and other available evidence, it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. A valuation allowance of\n$\n12.2\nmillion and\n$\n6.8\nmillion was recorded against gross deferred tax assets for certain investments, net operating and capital losses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has capital loss carryforwards of\n$\n10.6\nmillion, which, if unused, will expire in 2024.\nThe Company considers its non-U.S. earnings to be indefinitely reinvested outside of the U.S. to the extent these earnings are not subject to U.S. income tax under an anti-deferral tax regime. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries is\n$\n53.0\nmillion. Given our intent to reinvest these earnings for an indefinite period of time, we have not accrued a deferred tax liability on these earnings. A determination of an unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nThe provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following (in millions):\n​\n132\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, income before taxes consists of the following (in millions):\n​\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n​\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending uncertain tax positions, excluding interest and penalties, is as follows (in millions):\n​\nAs of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company had\n$\n162.1\nmillion,\n$\n137.4\nmillion, and\n$\n114.9\nmillion, respectively, of uncertain tax positions, net of federal benefit, which, if recognized in the future, would affect the effective income tax rate. Reductions to uncertain tax positions from the lapse of the applicable statutes of limitations and potential audit settlements during the next twelve months are estimated to be approximately\n$\n1.0\nmillion.\nEstimated interest costs and penalties are classified as part of the provision for income taxes in the Company's consolidated statements of income and were\n$\n9.7\nmillion,\n$\n6.9\nmillion, and\n$\n6.6\nmillion, for the periods ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Accrued interest and penalties were\n$\n35.8\nmillion,\n$\n26.1\nmillion and\n$\n19.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions in which Cboe operates:\n​\n​\nThe Company petitioned the U.S. Tax Court on January 13, 2017, May 7, 2018 and November 29, 2018 for a redetermination of IRS notices of deficiency for Cboe and certain of its subsidiaries for tax years 2011 through 2015 related to its Section 199 claims. These petitions resulted in the establishment of\nthree\ncases before the U.S. Tax Court. The Company also filed a complaint on October 5, 2018 with the Court of Federal Claims for a refund of Section 199 claims related to tax years 2008 through 2010. The complaint resulted in the establishment of a single case before the Court of Federal Claims.\n133\nThe first case that went to trial involved certain subsidiaries related to electronic trading for tax years 2011, 2012 and 2013. The U.S. Tax Court held the trial remotely from May 24, 2021 to June 1, 2021. Post-trial briefing in that case concluded on October 28, 2021. On July 9, 2021, the Company sought a stay in the second U.S. Tax Court case involving certain subsidiaries related to hybrid trading for the same tax years, which was denied on August 8, 2021. As a result,\ntwo\ncases remain pending in U.S. Tax Court, as does the case pending before the Court of Federal Claims. Trial dates in those cases have not been established.\nAlthough there can be no assurances, the Company continues to believe, based on its current assessment of the Section 199 claims, that the reasonably expected aggregate amount of any additional liabilities that may result from these cases, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has not resolved these matters, and proceedings continue in U.S. Tax Court and the Court of Federal Claims.\n22.  EARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe computation of basic net income per common share is calculated by reducing net income for the period by dividends paid or declared and undistributed net income for the period that are allocated to participating securities to arrive at net income allocated to common stockholders. Net income allocated to common stockholders is divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period to determine net income per share allocated to common stockholders.\nThe computation of diluted net income per share is calculated by dividing net income allocated to common stockholders by the sum of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus all additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. The dilutive effect is calculated using the more dilutive of the two-class or treasury stock method.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share data):\n​\nFor the periods presented, the Company did not have shares of stock-based compensation that would have an anti-dilutive effect on the computation of diluted earnings per share\n.\n134\n23.  COMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES, AND GUARANTEES\nLegal Proceedings\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company was subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business.\nThe Company reviews its legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews and inspections and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for those contingencies where the incurrence of a loss is probable and can be reasonably estimated, and the Company discloses the amount accrued and the amount of a reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if such disclosure is necessary for the consolidated financial statements to not be misleading. The Company does not record liabilities when the likelihood that the liability has been incurred is probable, but the amount cannot be reasonably estimated, or when the liability is believed to be only reasonably possible or remote. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is remote, reasonably possible, or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company does not believe that there is a reasonable possibility that any material loss exceeding the amounts already recognized for these legal proceedings and claims, regulatory reviews, inspections or other legal proceedings, if any, has been incurred. While the consequences of certain unresolved proceedings are not presently determinable, the outcome of any proceeding is inherently uncertain and an adverse outcome from certain matters could have a material effect on the financial position, results of operations, or cash flows of the Company in any given reporting period.\nCity of Providence\nOn April 18, 2014, the City of Providence, Rhode Island filed a securities class action lawsuit in the Southern District of New York against Bats and Direct Edge Holdings LLC, as well as\n14\nother securities exchanges. The action purports to be brought on behalf of all public investors who purchased and/or sold shares of stock in the United States since April 18, 2009 on a registered public stock exchange (“Exchange Defendants”) or a U.S.-based alternate trading venue and were injured as a result of the alleged misconduct detailed in the complaint, which includes allegations that the Exchange Defendants committed fraud through a variety of business practices associated with, among other things, what is commonly referred to as high frequency trading. On May 2, 2014 and May 20, 2014, American European Insurance Company and Harel Insurance Co., Ltd. each filed substantially similar class action lawsuits against the Exchange Defendants which were ultimately consolidated with the City of Providence, Rhode Island securities class action lawsuit. On June 18, 2015, the Southern District of New York (the “Lower Court”) held oral argument on the pending Motion to Dismiss and thereafter, on August 26, 2015, the Lower Court issued an Opinion and Order granting Exchange Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss, dismissing the complaint in full. Plaintiff filed a Notice of Appeal of the dismissal on September 24, 2015 and its appeal brief on January 7, 2016. Respondent's brief was filed on April 7, 2016 and oral argument was held on August 24, 2016. Following oral argument, the Court of Appeals issued an order requesting that the SEC submit an amicus brief on whether the Lower Court had jurisdiction and whether the Exchange Defendants have immunity in the claims alleged. The SEC filed its amicus brief with the Court of Appeals on November 28, 2016 and Plaintiff and the Exchange Defendants filed their respective supplemental response briefs on December 12, 2016. On December 19, 2017, the Court of Appeals reversed the Lower Court’s dismissal and remanded the case back to the Lower Court. On March 13, 2018, the Court of Appeals denied the Exchange Defendants’ motion for re-hearing. The Exchange Defendants filed their opening brief for their motion to dismiss May 18, 2018, Plaintiffs’ response was filed June 15, 2018 and the Exchange Defendants’ reply was filed June 29, 2018. On May 28, 2019, the Lower Court issued an opinion and order denying the Exchange Defendants’ motion to dismiss. On June 17, 2019, the Exchange Defendants filed a motion seeking interlocutory appeal of the May 28, 2019 dismissal order, which was denied July 16, 2019. Exchange Defendants filed their answers on July 25, 2019. Targeted discovery regarding class certification and legal preclusion concluded on April 26, 2021. On May 28, 2021, (1) Plaintiffs filed a Motion for Class Certification, (2) Bats and NYSE filed a joint Motion for Summary Judgment on Grounds of Legal Preclusion and a joint Motion for Summary Judgment on Grounds of Lack of Article III Standing, and (3) Nasdaq filed a Motion for Summary Judgment for Legal Preclusion. Briefing on these dispositive motions concluded in December 2021. The parties also filed motions to exclude some of the other’s experts. Oral argument regarding the joint Motion for Lack of Article III Standing and Exchange Defendant’s motion to exclude the testimony of one of Plaintiffs’ experts is scheduled for March 11, 2022. The Company is unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, the Company believes that the claims are without merit and intends to litigate the matter vigorously.\n135\nVIX Litigation\nOn March 20, 2018, a putative class action complaint captioned Tomasulo v. Cboe Exchange, Inc., et al., No. 18-cv-02025 was filed in federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the Company intentionally designed its products, operated its platforms, and formulated the method for calculating VIX and the Special Opening Quotation, (i.e., the special VIX value designed by the Company and calculated on the settlement date of VIX derivatives prior to the opening of trading), in a manner that could be collusively manipulated by a group of entities named as John Doe defendants. A number of similar putative class actions, some of which do not name the Company as a party, were filed in federal court in Illinois and New York on behalf of investors in certain volatility-related products. On June 14, 2018, the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation centralized the putative class actions in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois. On September 28, 2018, plaintiffs filed a master, consolidated complaint that is a putative class action alleging various claims against the Company and John Doe defendants in the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois. The claims asserted against the Company consist of a Securities Exchange Act fraud claim,\nthree\nCommodity Exchange Act claims and a state law negligence claim. Plaintiffs request a judgment awarding class damages in an unspecified amount, as well as punitive or exemplary damages in an unspecified amount, prejudgment interest, costs including attorneys’ and experts’ fees and expenses and such other relief as the court may deem just and proper. On November 19, 2018, the Company filed a motion to dismiss the master consolidated complaint and the plaintiffs filed their response on January 7, 2019. The Company filed its reply on January 28, 2019. On May 29, 2019, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois granted the Company’s motion to dismiss plaintiffs’ entire complaint against the Company. The state law negligence claim was dismissed with prejudice and the other claims were dismissed without prejudice with leave to file an amended complaint, which plaintiffs filed on July 19, 2019. On August 28, 2019, the Company filed its second motion to dismiss the amended consolidated complaint and plaintiffs filed their response on October 8, 2019. On January 27, 2020, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois granted the Company’s second motion to dismiss and all counts against the Company were dismissed with prejudice. On April 21, 2020, the federal district court for the Northern District of Illinois granted plaintiffs’ motion to certify the January 27, 2020 dismissal order for an immediate appeal. On May 19, 2020, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal with the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (“7th Circuit”), seeking to appeal the April 21, 2020 order granting the entry of partial final judgment and both orders granting the Company’s motions to dismiss entered on May 29, 2019 and January 27, 2020. On June 29, 2020, plaintiffs filed their opening brief with the 7th Circuit, on August 28, 2020 the Company filed its opposition brief with the 7th Circuit, on September 7, 2020, CME Group Inc., Intercontinental Exchange, Inc. and National Futures Association filed an amici curiae brief in support of the Company on the Bad Faith Standard with the 7th Circuit and on October 16, 2020, plaintiffs filed their reply brief with the 7th Circuit. Oral arguments were held remotely on November 30, 2020 and the parties are currently awaiting a decision by the 7\nth\nCircuit. The Company currently believes that the claims are without merit and intends to litigate the matter vigorously. The Company is unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation.\nOther\nAs self-regulatory organizations under the jurisdiction of the SEC, Cboe Options, C2, BZX, BYX, EDGX and EDGA are subject to routine reviews and inspections by the SEC. As a designated contract market under the jurisdiction of the CFTC, CFE is subject to routine rule enforcement reviews and examinations by the CFTC. Cboe SEF, LLC is a swap execution facility registered with the CFTC and subject to routine rule enforcement reviews and examinations by the CFTC. Cboe Trading and BIDS Trading are subject to reviews and inspections by FINRA. The Company has from time to time received inquiries and investigative requests from the SEC’s Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations and the CFTC’s Division of Market Oversight as well as the SEC Division of Enforcement and CFTC Division of Enforcement seeking information about the Company’s compliance with its obligations as a self-regulatory organization under the federal securities laws and Commodity Exchange Act as well as members’ compliance with the federal securities laws and Commodity Exchange Act.\nIn addition, while Cboe Europe, Cboe Chi-X Europe, EuroCCP, Cboe NL, Cboe Australia, Cboe Japan, and MATCHNow have not been the subject of any material litigation or regulatory investigation in the past, there is always the possibility of such action in the future. As Cboe Europe and Cboe Chi-X Europe are domiciled in the UK, it is likely that any action would be taken in the UK courts in relation to litigation or by the FCA in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. As EuroCCP is domiciled in the Netherlands, it is likely that any action would be taken in the Dutch courts in relation to litigation or by the DNB or Dutch Authority for Financial Markets in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. For Cboe NL, also domiciled in the Netherlands, it is likely that any actions would be taken in the Dutch courts in relation to litigation or Dutch Authority for Financial Markets in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. As Cboe Australia is domiciled in Australia, it is likely that any action would be taken in the Australian courts in relation to litigation or by the ASIC, in relation to any regulatory enforcement action. As Cboe Japan is domiciled in Japan, it is likely that any action would be taken in the Japanese courts in relation to litigation or by the JFSA or the JSDA in relation to any\n136\nregulatory enforcement action. As MATCHNow is domiciled in Canada, it is likely that any action would be taken in the Canadian courts in relation to litigation or by the IIROC or Ontario Securities Commission in relation to any regulatory enforcement action.\nThe Company is also currently a party to various other legal proceedings in addition to those already mentioned. Management does not believe that the likely outcome of any of these other reviews, inspections, investigations or other legal proceedings is expected to have a material impact on the Company’s financial position, results of operations, liquidity or capital resources.\nSee also Note 8 (“Credit Losses”) for information on promissory notes related to the CAT.\nSee also Note 21 (“Income Taxes”).\nContractual Obligations\nThe Company has contractual obligations related to licensing agreements with various licensors, some of which included fixed fees and/or variable fees calculated using agreed upon contracted rates and reported cleared volumes. Certain licensing agreements contain annual minimum fee requirements that total\n$\n14.0\nmillion each year for\nthe\nnext\nfive\nyears\n.\nSee Note 14 (“Clearing Operations”) for information on EuroCCP’s clearinghouse exposure guarantee.\nSee Note 24 (“Leases”) for information on lease obligations.\n24.
