Laboratory balances are primarily used in the pharmaceutical, biotechnology, testing labs, food, chemical, cosmetics, academia, and other industries.\n4\nPipettes\nPipettes are used in life science research laboratories for dispensing small volumes of liquids. We develop, manufacture, and distribute advanced pipettes, including single- and multi-channel manual and electronic pipettes. We also develop and produce high-value consumables such as pipette tips and tubes. We maintain service centers in key markets where customers periodically send their pipettes for certified recalibrations. These service centers, combined with our advanced asset management solutions, provide our customers with innovative solutions to maintain their instruments and meet regulatory compliance. Our principal end-markets are pharmaceutical, biotech, and academia.\nAnalytical Instruments\nTitrators measure the chemical composition of samples and are used in environmental and research laboratories as well as in quality control labs in the pharmaceutical, testing lab, food and beverage, and other industries. Our high-end titrators are multi-tasking models, which can perform two determinations simultaneously on multiple vessels. Our offering includes robotics to automate routine work in quality control applications.\nThermal analysis systems measure material properties as a function of temperature, such as weight, dimension, energy flow, and viscoelastic properties. Thermal analysis systems are used in nearly every industry, but primarily in the plastics and polymer industries and academia and increasingly in the pharmaceutical industry.\npH meters measure acidity in laboratory samples. We also manufacture and sell density and refractometry instruments, which measure chemical concentrations in solutions. In addition, we manufacture and sell moisture analyzers, which precisely determine the moisture content of a sample by utilizing the loss on drying method, and UV/VIS spectrophotometers that optimize spectroscopic workflows.\nLaboratory Software\nLabX, our laboratory software platform, manages and analyzes data generated by our balances, titrators, pH meters, physical value analyzers, and other analytical instruments like UV/VIS spectrophotometers. LabX provides full network capability; assists with workflow automation; has efficient, intuitive protocols; and enables customers to collect and archive data in compliance with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration’s traceability and data integrity requirements for electronically stored data (also known as 21 CFR Part 11).\nAutomated Chemistry Solutions\nOur automated chemistry solutions focus on select applications in the chemical and drug discovery process. Our automated lab reactors and in situ analysis systems are considered integral to the process development and scale-up activities of our customers. Our on-line measurement technologies, based on infrared and laser light scattering, enable customers to monitor chemical reactions and crystallization processes in real time in the lab and plant. In situ samples allow overnight sampling and testing. Additionally, we provide industry-leading software solutions that enable our customers to manage, optimize, and improve experiments as well as production scale-up. We believe that our portfolio of integrated technologies can bring significant efficiencies to the development process, enabling our customers to bring new drugs and chemicals to market faster.\nProcess Analytics\nOur process analytics business provides instruments for the in-line measurement of liquid and gas parameters used primarily in the production process of pharmaceutical, biotech, beverage, micro-electronics, chemical, and refining companies, as well as power plants. More than half of our process\n5\nanalytics sales are to the pharmaceutical and biotech markets, where our customers need fast and secure scale-up and production that meet the validation processes required for GMP (Good Manufacturing Processes) and other regulatory standards like the USP (U.S. Pharmacopoeia) regulations for ultrapure water quality. We are a leadin\ng solution provider for liquid analytical measurement to control and optimize production processes. Our solutions include sensor and analyzer technology for measuring pH, dissolved oxygen, carbon dioxide, conductivity, turbidity, ozone, total organic carbons, pressure, bioburden, sodium, and silica, as well as laser analyzers for gas measurement. Intelligent sensor diagnostics capabilities enable improved asset management solutions for our customers to reduce process downtime and maintenance costs. Our instruments offer leading multi-parameter capabilities and plant-\nwide control system integration, which are key for integrated measurement of multiple parameters to secure production quality and efficiency. With a worldwide network of specialists, we support customers in critical process applications, compliance, and systems integration questions.\nIndustrial Instruments\nWe manufacture numerous industrial weighing instruments and related terminals and offer dedicated software solutions for the pharmaceutical, chemical, food, discrete manufacturing, and other industries. In addition, we manufacture metal detection, x-ray, checkweighing, and other end-of-line product inspection systems used in production and packaging. We supply automatic identification and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning, and identification technologies for transport, shipping, and logistics customers. We also offer heavy industrial scales and related software. The industrial instruments and related service business accounted for approximately 39% of our net sales in 2021, 40% in 2020, and 41% in 2019.\nIndustrial Weighing Instruments\nWe offer a comprehensive line of industrial scales and weighing devices, such as bench scales, floor scales, and weigh modules, for weighing loads from a few grams to several thousand kilograms in applications ranging from measuring materials in chemical production to quality completeness control in discrete manufacturing to weighing packages at the end of the line. Our products are used in a wide range of industrial applications, such as counting, formulating and mixing ingredients, and quality control.\nIndustrial Terminals\nOur industrial scale terminals collect data and integrate it into manufacturing processes, helping to automate them. Our terminals allow users to remotely download formulation recipes or access setup data and can minimize downtime through predictive rather than reactive maintenance.\nTransportation and Logistics\nWe supply automatic dimensional measurement and data capture solutions, which integrate in-motion weighing, dimensioning, and identification technologies. With these solutions, customers can measure the weight and cubic volume of packages for appropriate billing, load management, and quality control. Our solutions also integrate into customers’ information systems.\nVehicle Scale Systems\nOur primary heavy industrial products are scales for weighing trucks or railcars (i.e., weighing bulk goods as they enter or leave a factory or at a toll station). Heavy industrial scales are capable of measuring weights up to 500 tons and permit accurate weighing under extreme environmental conditions. We also offer advanced computer software that can be used with our heavy industrial scales to facilitate a broad range of customer solutions and provides a complete system for managing vehicle transaction processing.\n6\nIndustrial Software\nWe offer software that can be used with our industrial instruments. Examples include FreeWeigh.Net, statistical quality control software; FormWeigh.Net, formulation/batching software; and DataBridge, which supports the operation of vehicle scales. FreeWeigh.Net and FormWeigh.Net provide full network capability and enable customers to collect and archive data in compliance with U.S. Food and Drug Administration requirements, 21 CFR Part 11.\nProduct Inspection\nIncreasing safety and consumer protection requirements are driving the need for more sophisticated end-of-line product inspection systems (e.g., for use in food processing and packaging, pharmaceutical, packaged consumer goods, and other industries). We are a leading global provider of metal detectors,      x-ray systems, checkweighers, camera-based imaging equipment, and track-and-trace solutions that are used in these industries. Metal detectors are most commonly used to detect fine particles of metal that may be contained in raw materials or may be generated by the manufacturing process itself. X-ray inspection is used to detect metallic contamination in applications unsuited to metal detectors and many types of non-metallic contamination, such as glass, calcified bone, stones, and pits. Our x-ray systems are also used for mass control and for determining and controlling the fat content in meat. Checkweighers are used to control the filled weight of packaged goods such as food, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics. Our camera-based vision inspection solutions provide in-line inspection of package quality, labels, and content, which are needs for food and beverage, consumer goods, and pharmaceutical companies. Vision inspection systems with associated specialist software enable our pharmaceutical customers to implement traceability and serialization tracking, as required by regulation. All of our technologies are integrated with material handling systems to ensure the correct presentation of the customer’s product to the device and the secure rejection of non-conforming product, and are frequently designed to comply with stringent hygiene standards. Our technologies may also be used together as components of integrated packaging lines. ProdX Inspect is our quality and productivity control software for helping customers comply with regulations and optimize process efficiency, either as a stand-alone solution or through integration with the customer’s manufacturing and enterprise systems.\nRetail Weighing Solutions\nSupermarkets, hypermarkets, and other food retail businesses make use of multiple weighing and food labeling solutions for handling fresh goods (such as meats, vegetables, fruits, or cheeses). We offer networked scales and software, which can integrate backroom, counter, self-service, and checkout functions and can incorporate fresh goods item data into a supermarket’s overall food item and inventory management system. In addition, we offer stand-alone scales for basic counter weighing and pricing, price finding, and printing. The customer benefits of our retail solutions are in the areas of enterprise-wide article and price management, merchandising, and regulatory compliance. In North America and select other markets, our offering also includes automated packaging and labeling solutions for the meat backroom, which are fully integrated with the scales in the store. The retail business accounted for approximately 5% of our net sales in 2021, 6% in 2020, and 7% in 2019.\nCustomers and Distribution\nOur principal customers include companies in the following key end-markets: the life science industry (pharmaceutical and biotech companies, as well as independent research organizations and testing labs); food and beverage manufacturers; chemical, specialty chemicals, and cosmetics companies; the academic community; food retailers; the transportation and logistics industry; the metals industry; and the electronics industry.\n7\nOur products are sold through a variety of distribution channels. Generally, more technically sophisticated products are sold through our direct sales force, while less complicated products are sold through indirect channels. Our sales through direct channels exceed our sales through indirect channels. A significant portion of our sales in the Americas is generated through indirect channels, including sales of our Ohaus-branded products. Ohaus-branded products target markets, such as the educational market, in which customers are interested in lower cost, a more limited set of features, and less comprehensive support and service.\nWe have a diversified customer base, with no single end-customer accounting for more than 1% of 2021 net sales.\nSales and Service\nMarket Organizations\nWe maintain geographically focused market organizations around the world that are responsible for all aspects of our sales and service. The market organizations are customer-focused, with an emphasis on building and maintaining value-added relationships with customers in our target market segments. Each market organization has the ability to leverage best practices from other units while maintaining the flexibility to adapt its marketing and service efforts to account for different cultural and economic conditions. Market organizations also work closely with our producing organizations (described below) by providing feedback on manufacturing and product development initiatives, new product and application ideas, and information about key market segments.\nWe have one of the largest and broadest global sales and service organizations among precision instrument manufacturers we compete against. At December 31, 2021, our sales and service group consisted of approximately 8,600 employees in sales, marketing and customer service (including related administration), and post-sales technical service, located in approximately 40 countries. This field organization has the capability to provide service and support to our customers and distributors in major markets across the globe. This is important because our customers increasingly seek to do business with a consistent global approach.\nService\nOur service business continues to be successful with a focus on providing uptime and calibration services, as well as further expanding our offerings to provide value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance, performance enhancements, application expertise and training, and remote services. We have a unique offering to our pharmaceutical customers in promoting the use of our instruments in compliance with FDA and other international regulations, and we can provide these services to most customers’ locations around the world. Our global service network is also an important factor in our ability to expand in emerging markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world. Service (representing service contracts, on demand services, and replacement parts) accounted for approximately 20% of our net sales in 2021 and approximately 22% in both 2020 and 2019.\nBeyond revenue opportunities, we believe service is a key part of our solution offering and helps significantly in customer retention. The close relationships and frequent contact with our large customer base allow us to be the trusted advisor of our customers, which provides us with high-quality sales opportunities as well as innovative product and application ideas.\n8\nResearch and Development and Manufacturing\nProducing Organizations\nOur research, product development, and manufacturing efforts are organized into a number of producing organizations. Our focused producing organizations help reduce product development time and costs, improve customer focus, and maintain technological leadership. The producing organizations work together to share ideas and best practices, and there is a close interface and coordinated customer interaction among marketing organizations and producing organizations. We also have regional logistics hubs to satisfy customer delivery requirements while optimizing our logistics processes.\nResearch and Development\nWe continue to invest in product innovation to provide technologically advanced products to our customers for existing and new applications. Over the last three years, we have invested $454 million in research and development ($170 million in 2021, $140 million in 2020, and $144 million in 2019), which is approximately 5% of net sales for each year. Our research and development efforts fall into three categories:\n•\ntechnology advancements, which generate new products or features and increase the value of our products. These advancements may be in the form of enhanced or new functionality, new applications for our technologies, more accurate or reliable measurement, additional software capability, or automation through robotics or other means.\n•\napplications development to complement our products and provide complete solutions to our customers.\n•\ncost reductions, which reduce the manufacturing cost of our products through better overall design and/or improve the ease of serviceability.\nWe devote a substantial proportion of our research and development budget to software development. This includes software to process the signals captured by the sensors of our instruments, application-specific software, and software that connects our solutions into customers’ existing IT systems. We closely integrate research and development with marketing, manufacturing, and product engineering. We have approximately 1,500 employees in research and development and product engineering in countries around the globe.\nManufacturing\nWe are a worldwide manufacturer, with facilities principally located in China, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. We emphasize product quality in our manufacturing operations, and most of our products require very strict tolerances and exact specifications. We use an extensive quality control system that is integrated into each step of the manufacturing process. All major manufacturing facilities have achieved ISO 9001 certification. We believe that our manufacturing capacity is sufficient to meet our present and currently anticipated demand.\nWe generally manufacture critical components, which are components that contain proprietary technology. When outside manufacturing is more efficient, we contract with other manufacturers for certain nonproprietary components. We use a wide range of suppliers. We believe our supply arrangements are adequate and that there are no material constraints on the sources and availability of materials. From time to time, we may rely on a single supplier for all of our requirements of a particular component. Supply arrangements for electronic components are generally made globally.\n9\nBacklog; Seasonality\nOur manufacturing turnaround time is generally short, which permits us to manufacture orders to fill for most of our products. Backlog is generally a function of requested customer delivery dates and is typically not longer than one to two months.\nOur business has historically experienced a slight amount of seasonal variation, particularly the high-end laboratory instruments business. Traditionally, sales in the first quarter are slightly lower than, and sales in the fourth quarter are slightly higher than, sales in the second and third quarters. Fourth quarter sales have historically generated approximately 28% to 30% of our net sales. This trend has a somewhat greater effect on earnings before taxes than on net sales because fixed costs are generally incurred evenly across all quarters.\nEmployees\nOur total global workforce was 17,800, consisting of 15,600 employees and 2,200 temporary personnel, as of December 31, 2021, and includes approximately 6,200 in Europe, 5,500 in North and South America, and 6,100 in Asia and other countries.\nWe are proud of our corporate culture and our talented employees. We endeavor to continue to provide an attractive work environment and keep our employees fully engaged. We know that our future success depends on attracting, developing, and retaining the best employees. We promote equal opportunity and inclusiveness worldwide and value diversity in our global workforce, which reflects the diversity in the many communities in which we operate internationally. We employ people of more than 100 nationalities.\nWe promote diversity and we encourage all employees, inclusive of all our demographics, to take on more responsibilities and management positions. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 36% of our global employee headcount was female, with approximately 28% holding management positions. We place great emphasis on performance management, training, and developing our employees across all levels and regions. During 2021, approximately 13,900 employees completed one or more training courses. Lastly, we have local safety programs in place in all relevant units, and select locations have implemented a certified work safety management system. Severe workplace accidents are rare and we have had no fatalities from occupational incidents in the past five years.\nWe believe our employee relations are good, and we have not suffered any material employee work stoppage or strike during the last five years. Approximately 7,600 employees are represented by collective bargaining or another arrangement organized to represent employee interests.\nSustainability\nSustainability touches all aspects of our business, from designing, sourcing, and producing our products, to selling and delivering them to our customers, to handling them at the end of their lifecycle. A sustainable mindset helps guide us to make the right decisions for our customers, employees, suppliers, shareholders, and the communities in which we operate our business. We want to manage our business sustainably to position the Company for long-term growth. More than 10 years ago, we launched our GreenMT program to pursue environmental, social, and governance priorities where we can have a significant impact. We do this in five key areas: (1) keeping our operations sustainable over the long term by ensuring we use resources efficiently, (2) helping our customers to be sustainable in their businesses by offering sustainable products and services, (3) promoting responsible practices within our supply chain, (4) ensuring an engaged workforce through fair, attractive, safe, and development-minded workplaces, and (5) following corporate governance best practices.\nWe have set a number of goals relating to our GreenMT sustainability program, including reducing our carbon footprint and other environmental, social, and governance goals. As of 2020, we achieved carbon neutrality with respect to Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO\n2\nemissions, and source 100% renewable\n10\nelectricity. We also broadened our goals relating to waste, including reducing our waste intensity by 20% and achieving zero waste to landfill, in each case by 2025. We are also committed to greenhouse gas emission reduction targets in line with what the latest climate science deems necessary to meet the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change. Our commitment includes near-term, long-term, and net-zero targets consistent with the latest criteria issued by the Science Based Target initiative (SBTi). We are working toward validating our targets with SBTi and intend to share additional details on the specific targets as we progress through the validation process. We report annually on our progress related to sustainability topics in our Corporate Responsibility Report, available on www.mt.com/sustainability.\nBlue Ocean Program\nBlue Ocean refers to our program to establish a global operating model with standardized, automated, and integrated processes and high levels of global data transparency. It encompasses an enterprise architecture, with a global, single-instance ERP system. Within our IT systems, we continue to move toward integrated, homogeneous applications and common data structures. We are also largely standardizing our key business processes. The implementation of the systems and processes has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period. We have implemented the Blue Ocean program in our U.S., China, Switzerland, Germany, U.K., Benelux, Spain, Japan, and Southeast Asia operations. We estimate that we have approximately 85% of our users on the program, and we will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years.\nIntellectual Property\nWe hold over 5,000 patents and trademarks (including pending applications), primarily in the United States, Switzerland, China, the European Union, Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy, France, Japan, South Korea, Brazil, and India. Our products generally incorporate a wide variety of technological innovations, some of which are protected by patents of various durations. Products are generally not protected as a whole by individual patents, and as a result, no one patent or group of related patents is material to our business. We have numerous trademarks, including the Mettler-Toledo name and logo, which are material to our business. We regularly protect against infringement of our intellectual property.\nRegulation\nOur products are subject to various regulatory standards and approvals by weights and measures regulatory authorities. All of our electrical components are subject to electrical safety standards. We believe that we are in compliance in all material respects with applicable regulations.\nApprovals are required to ensure our instruments do not impermissibly influence other instruments and are themselves not affected by other instruments. In addition, some of our products are used in “legal for trade” applications, in which prices based on weight are calculated and for which specific weights and measures approvals are required. Although there are a large number of regulatory agencies across our markets, there is an increasing trend toward harmonization of standards, and weights and measures regulation is harmonized across the European Union.\nOur products may also be subject to special requirements depending on the end-user and market. For example, laboratory customers are typically subject to Good Laboratory Practices (GLP), industrial customers to Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP), pharmaceutical customers to U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, and customers in food processing industries may be subject to Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) regulations. Products used in hazardous environments may also be subject to special requirements.\n11\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.\nWe are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities. A former subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo, LLC known as Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc. was one of two private parties ordered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, in an administrative consent order signed on June 13, 1988, to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in Landing, New Jersey. After the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations, Hi-Speed became solely responsible for compliance with the order. Residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a Classification Exception Area which the Department of Environmental Protection has approved and within which the Company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern. A concurrent Well Restriction Area also exists for the site. The Department of Environmental Protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will be approximately a total of $0.4 million.\nIn addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCompetition\nOur markets are highly competitive. Many of the markets in which we compete are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. For example, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. In addition, some of our competitors are domiciled in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets can impair our operating margins in certain product lines and geographic markets.\nWe expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that we have technological and other competitive advantages over many of our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages. These advantages include our worldwide market leadership positions; our global brand and reputation; our track record of technological innovation; our comprehensive, high-quality solution offering; our global sales and service offering; our large installed base of instruments; and the diversification of our revenue base by geographic region, product range, application, and customer. To remain competitive, we must continue to invest in research and development, sales and marketing,\n12\ncustomer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments or that we will be successful in identifying, developing, and maintaining any competitive advantages.\nWe believe the principal competitive factors in developed markets for purchasing decisions are the product itself, application support, service support, and price. In emerging markets, where there is greater demand for less sophisticated products, price is a more important factor than in developed markets. Competition in the U.S. laboratory market is also influenced by the presence of large distributors that sell not only our products but those of our competitors as well.\nCompany Website and Information\nYou can find our website on the internet at\nwww.mt.com\n.

    "text": "Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results\nOperational Risks\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and will likely continue to adversely affect, various aspects of our business, such as our workforce and supply chain, and make it more difficult and expensive to meet our obligations to our customers, and has adversely affected the global economy, which in turn can adversely affect our global business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nOur global operations expose us to risks associated with public health crises that could have an adverse effect on our business results and financial condition.\nFor instance, since late 2019, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has spread globally in all countries where we conduct business. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, stay-at-home orders and lockdowns, travel restrictions, vaccination and testing requirements, and other public health safety measures. These restrictions continue to change as COVID-19 evolves, variants are discovered, and vaccinations are distributed in each country and region.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has resulted and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the global economy, as well as to businesses and capital markets around the world. COVID-19 has interfered and may continue to interfere with general commercial activity related to our supply chain and customer base. In addition, COVID-19 may negatively affect our customers’ businesses, which may result in delayed or reduced purchases from us. Some customers may also have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us, resulting in late payments or an inability of some customers to make payments at all.\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues, we may experience volatility in our results, including reduced global sales volume from lower customer demand. Our operations could be negatively affected if our employees are subject to governmental COVID-19 curfews, stay-at-home orders, lockdowns, or facility closures, or if they are quarantined or become ill as a result of exposure to COVID-19.\nFuture impacts to the Company's business as a result of COVID-19 and its variants could also include disruptions to the Company's manufacturing operations caused by lockdowns, facility closures, reductions in operating hours, staggered shifts and other social distancing efforts, and labor shortages. The emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in late 2021 has presented particular challenges to the global economy given its high level of transmissibility, which can cause many people to be affected at the same time or over a short period of time, leading to potential disruptions to our business and supply chain. Our supply chain is currently facing wide-ranging global challenges, although we have been able to meet delivery requirements of our customers with some interruption. We continue to closely monitor risks associated with our supply chain, including the availability of certain components, material shortages, supplier delays, potential transportation delays, and higher transportation and material costs.\nGlobal inflation also significantly increased during 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, logistics, and labor markets.  These inflationary conditions could have a negative impact on our operating results in future years. Disruptions in labor markets, including a new competitive landscape created by remote work capabilities, could also lead to higher attrition, increased compensation levels, and longer recruiting cycles.\nUncertainties and challenges related to COVID-19, including new variants (such as Omicron), lockdowns, and logistical and inflationary challenges, and the resulting impact to the economy continue in all regions of the world, and market conditions may change quickly. While it is difficult to estimate the\n14\nextent and duration of any COVID-19 implications, the effects on our business, results of operations, and financial condition could be material.\nWe sell primarily to companies in developed countries. An economic downturn in these countries could hurt our operating results.\nMost of our business is derived from companies in developed countries. Economic uncertainty in many parts of the world, including regional effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, international trade disputes, and sovereign debt levels in the European Union and the United States, are situations that we monitor closely. If developed countries were to experience slow growth or recession, we could see the following effects:\n•\na drop in demand for our products;\n•\ncompanies being unable to finance their businesses;\n•\ndifficulty in obtaining materials and supplies;\n•\npotential devaluation and/or impairment of assets;\n•\ndifficulty in collecting accounts receivables;\n•\nan increase in accounts receivable write-offs; and\n•\ngreater foreign exchange rate volatility affecting our profitability and cash flow.\nEconomic downturns or recessions adversely affect our operating results because our customers often decrease or delay capital expenditures. Customers may also purchase lower-cost products made by competitors and not resume purchasing our products even after economic conditions improve. These conditions would reduce our revenues and profitability.\nIn addition, a potential financial crisis on financial institutions globally would likely have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and our business.\nWe are subject to certain risks associated with our international operations and have a significant concentration of business in China.\nWe conduct business in many countries, including emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Eastern Europe, and these operations represent a significant portion of our sales and earnings. For example, our Chinese operations accounted for 21% of sales to external customers, approximately 36% of our global production, and 35% of total segment profit during 2021. In addition to the currency risks discussed below, international operations pose other substantial risks and problems for us, including the following:\n•\nlocal tariffs and trade barriers;\n•\nadditions or revisions to a country's legal and regulatory requirements;\n•\ndifficulties in staffing and managing local operations and/or mandatory salary increases;\n•\ncredit risks arising from financial difficulties facing local customers and distributors;\n•\ndifficulties in protecting intellectual property;\n•\nnationalization of private enterprises which may result in the confiscation of assets, as we hold significant assets around the world in the form of property, plant, and equipment, inventory, and accounts receivable, as well as $59.0 million of cash at December 31, 2021 in our Chinese subsidiaries;\n•\nrestrictions on investments and/or limitations regarding foreign ownership;\n•\nadverse tax consequences, including tax disputes and imposition or increase of withholding and other taxes on remittances and other payments by subsidiaries;\n•\nthe adoption of new or expansion of current travel restrictions or the intensification of trade wars;\n•\ndomestic purchasing requirements that could favor local competition;\n15\n•\nother uncertain local economic, political, and social conditions, including inflation, hyper-inflation, and other decreases in purchasing power, or periods of low or no productivity growth; and\n•\ncredit tightening or reduction in credit availability for local customers.\nWe must also comply with regulations regarding the conversion and repatriation of funds earned in local currencies. For example, we need government approval to convert earnings from our operations in China into other currencies and to repatriate these funds. If we cannot comply with these or other applicable regulations or these regulations are amended to make it more difficult to repatriate the funds, we may face increased difficulties in using cash generated in China.\nWe are required to comply with various import, export control, and economic sanctions laws, which may affect our transactions with certain customers, business partners, and other persons, including in certain cases dealings with or between our employees and subsidiaries. In certain circumstances, export control and economic sanctions regulations may prohibit the export of certain products, services, and technologies, and in other circumstances, we may be required to obtain an export license before exporting a controlled item. While we continue to do business in Russia, we follow all relevant laws and regulations. Sanctions imposed on business in Russia may affect the economy and our business in Russia. In addition, failure to comply with any of these regulations could result in civil and criminal actions, monetary and non-monetary penalties, disruptions to our business, limitations on our ability to import and export products and services, and damage to our reputation.\nGrowth in emerging markets, especially China, can be volatile and change quickly.\nOur business and financial performance may be adversely affected by a cybersecurity attack.\nWe rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, fulfill orders, support our customers, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our internally developed system and processes, as well as those provided by third-party vendors, may be susceptible to damage or interruption from cybersecurity incidents, such as terrorist or hacker attacks, the introduction of malicious computer viruses, ransomware, falsification of banking and other information, insider risk, or other security breaches. If there is a cybersecurity incident, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of assets or data, or reduced functionality. Many of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality a cybersecurity incident could cause. Security breaches of our systems which allow inappropriate access to or inadvertent transfer of information and misappropriation or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information belonging to us or to our employees, customers, or suppliers could result in our suffering significant financial and reputational damage.\nCustomers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage critical information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible that a cyber attack could result in the loss or compromise of critical information. If a customer alleges that a cyber attack causes or contributes to a loss or compromise of critical information, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to our reputation and financial condition.\nWhile we attempt to mitigate cybersecurity risks by employing a number of proactive measures, including mandatory quarterly ongoing employee training and awareness, technical security controls, enhanced data protection, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems remain potentially vulnerable to cybersecurity threats, any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business. We believe our mitigation measures reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of a cybersecurity incident. Despite any precautions we may take, a cybersecurity incident could harm our reputation and financial condition and cause us to incur legal liability and increased costs to respond to such events. Our cyber liability insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or asset or data loss as a result of cybersecurity incidents.\n16\nIn addition, regulatory or legislative action related to cybersecurity, privacy, and data protection worldwide, such as the European General Data Protection Regulation which went into effect in May 2018, may increase the costs to develop, implement, or secure our products or services. We expect cybersecurity regulations to continue to evolve and be costly to implement. If we violate or fail to comply with such regulatory or legislative requirements, we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned, and such fines or penalties could have a material adverse effect on our business and operations.\nWe are vulnerable to system failures and data loss risks, which could harm our business.\nWe rely on our technology infrastructure to interact with suppliers, sell our products and services, support our customers, fulfill orders, and bill, collect, and make payments. Our systems are vulnerable to damage or interruption from natural disasters, power loss, telecommunication failures, malicious employees or employee negligence, computer viruses, and other events. When we upgrade or change systems, we may suffer interruptions in service, loss of data, or reduced functionality. A significant number of our systems are not redundant, and our disaster recovery planning is not sufficient for every eventuality. Despite any precautions we may take, such problems could result in interruptions in our services, fraudulent or negligent loss of assets, or unauthorized disclosure of confidential information, which could harm our reputation and financial condition. Our business interruption insurance may not be sufficient to compensate us for losses that may result from interruptions in our services or data loss as a result of system failures.\nCustomers may use our products and/or software to generate or manage confidential information. Though we take steps to ensure our products and/or software are secure, it is possible customers could lose confidential information stored on our products. If a customer alleges system failures in our products and/or software cause or contribute to a loss, whether or not caused by us, we could face harm to our reputation and our financial condition and legal liability.\nWe have also been implementing our Blue Ocean program to globalize our business processes and information technology systems that includes the implementation of a Company-wide enterprise resource planning system. This has been proceeding on a staggered basis over a multi-year period. We have implemented the program in our U.S., Chinese, Swiss, German, U.K., Benelux, Spain, Japan, and Southeast Asia operations. We estimate that we have approximately 85% of our users on the program and will continue to implement additional locations and functionality over the coming years. If our implementation is flawed, we could suffer interruptions in operations and customer-facing activities that could harm our reputation and financial condition or cause us to lose data, experience reduced functionality, or have delays in reporting financial information. It may take us longer to implement the program than we have planned, and the project may cost us more than we have estimated, either of which would negatively impact our ability to generate cost savings or other efficiencies. In addition, the program has increased our reliance on a single information technology system, which would have greater consequences should we experience a system disruption.\nOur ability to manufacture and deliver products and services may be disrupted.\nWe have key manufacturing facilities located in China, Europe, and the United States. Many of our products are developed and manufactured at single locations, with limited alternate facilities. In addition, a large portion of our products and spare parts are distributed through regional logistics centers, in which certain logistics activities are outsourced to third parties. If we experience any significant disruption in these facilities for any reason, such as the COVID-19 pandemic described on page 14, global supply chain and production issues, strikes or other labor unrest, power interruptions, cybersecurity attacks, fire, earthquakes, hurricanes, floods, rising water levels, other weather events or natural disasters (including the potential impacts of climate change), or other events beyond our control, we may be unable to satisfy customer demand for our products or services resulting in lost sales. It may be expensive to resolve these\n17\nissues, even though some of these risks are covered by insurance policies. More importantly, customers may switch to competitors and may not return to us even if we resolve the interruption.\nOur business would suffer if we were unable to obtain supplies of material.\nWe purchase most of our raw materials, components, and supplies from multiple suppliers. Some items are purchased from a limited or single source of supply, and disruption of these sources whether as a result of issues with our suppliers' operation or the timely availability of shipments from freight carriers could affect our ability to manufacture products. The COVID-19 pandemic has caused numerous disruptions to supply chains, often resulting in delivery delays, inflated costs, and increases in shipping rates. Even where multiple sources of materials and components are available, the quality of the alternative materials, regulatory and contractual requirements to qualify materials for use in manufacturing, and the time required to establish new relationships with reliable suppliers could result in manufacturing delays and possible loss of sales. If we are unable to obtain materials or components for an extended time, this could damage our customer relationships and harm our financial condition or results of operations.\nOur product development efforts may not produce commercially viable products in a timely manner.\nIf we do not introduce new products and enhancements, our products could become technologically obsolete over time, which would harm our operating results. To remain competitive, we must continue to make significant investments in research and development, sales and marketing, customer service and support, and operational excellence throughout our supply chain. We cannot be sure that we will have sufficient resources to continue to make these investments. In developing new products, we may be required to make substantial investments before we can determine their commercial viability. As a result, we may not be successful in developing new products and we may never realize the benefits of our research and development activities.\nWe face risks related to sales through distributors and other third parties that we do not control, which could harm our business.\nWe sell some products through third parties, including distributors and value-added resellers. This exposes us to various risks, including competitive pressure, concentration of sales volumes, credit risks, and compliance risks. We may rely on one or a few key distributors for a product or market, and the loss of these distributors could reduce our revenue and net earnings. Distributors may also face financial difficulties, including bankruptcy, which could harm our collection of accounts receivables. Violations of the FCPA or similar anti-bribery laws by distributors or other third-party intermediaries could materially impact our business. In addition to financial risk, actions of some of our distributors could cause reputational harm, especially if our products are involved. Risks related to our use of distributors may reduce sales, increase expenses, and weaken our competitive position.\nDepartures of key employees could impair our operations.\nKey employees could leave the Company. If any key employees stopped working for us, our operations could be harmed. Important R&D personnel may leave and join competitors, which could substantially delay or hinder ongoing development projects. We have no key man life insurance policies with respect to any of our senior executives.\nOur business involves certain operating risks, and our insurance may not be adequate to cover all insured losses of liabilities we might incur in our operations.\nWe have procured various insurance policies for certain types of insurance coverage and in varying coverage amounts. Our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur\n18\nin our operations. Furthermore, our insurance may not adequately protect us against liability from all of the hazards of our business. As a result of market conditions, premiums and deductibles for certain of our insurance policies may substantially increase. In some instances, certain insurance could become unavailable or available only for reduced amounts of coverage. We also are subject to the risk that we may be unable to maintain or obtain insurance of the type and amount we desire at a reasonable cost. If we were to incur a significant liability for which we were uninsured or for which we were not fully insured, it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position, results of operations, and cash flows.\nStrategic Risks\nA prolonged downturn or additional consolidation in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and chemical industries could adversely affect our operating results. A reduction in the capital resources or government funding of our customers could reduce our sales.\nOur products are used extensively in the pharmaceutical, food and beverage, and chemical industries. Consolidation in these industries hurt our sales in prior years. In recent years, there has been an increase in consolidation within these industries. A prolonged global economic downturn, a downturn affecting one or more of these industries, or additional consolidation in any of these industries could adversely affect our operating results. In addition, the capital spending policies of our customers in these and other industries are based on a variety of factors we cannot control, including the resources available for purchasing equipment, the spending priorities among various types of equipment, and policies regarding capital expenditures. Any decrease or delay in capital spending by our customers would cause our revenues to decline and could harm our profitability. A decline in government funding of research or education could reduce some customers’ ability to purchase our products.\nWe operate in highly competitive markets, and it may be difficult for us to preserve operating margins, gain market share, and maintain a technological advantage.\nOur markets are highly competitive. Many are fragmented both geographically and by application, particularly the industrial and food retailing markets. As a result, we face numerous regional or specialized competitors, many of which are well established in their markets. In addition, some of our competitors are divisions of larger companies with potentially greater financial and other resources than our own. There has also been an increase in the consolidation of precision instrument companies in recent years. Any consolidation within our market could result in competitors becoming larger and having greater financial and other resources than our own. Some of our competitors are domiciled or operate in emerging markets and may have a lower cost structure than ours. We are confronted with new competitors in emerging markets which, although relatively small in size today, could become larger companies in their home markets. Given the sometimes significant growth rates of these emerging markets, and in light of their cost advantage over developed markets, emerging market competitors could become more significant global competitors. Taken together, the competitive forces present in our markets could harm our operating margins. We expect our competitors to continue to improve the design and performance of their products and to introduce new products with competitive prices. Although we believe that our products and services have advantages over our competitors, we may not be able to realize and maintain these advantages.\n19\nWe may face risks associated with future acquisitions.\nWe may pursue acquisitions of complementary product lines, technologies, or businesses. Acquisitions involve numerous risks, including difficulties in integrating the acquired operations, technologies, and products; diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns; and potential departures of key employees of the acquired company. If we successfully identify acquisitions in the future, completing such acquisitions may result in new issuances of our stock that may be dilutive to current owners, increases in our debt and contingent liabilities, and additional amortization expense related to intangible assets. Any of these acquisition-related risks could have a material adverse effect on our profitability.\nLarger companies have identified life sciences and instruments as businesses they will consider entering or expanding their presence, which could change the competitive dynamics of these markets. In addition, we may not be able to identify, successfully complete, or integrate potential acquisitions in the future. Even if we can do so, we cannot be sure that these acquisitions will have a positive impact on our business or operating results. We are also required to estimate the fair value of certain assets acquired or liabilities assumed. Such fair values may be based on valuation models which are subject to inherent uncertainties and our judgments regarding certain assumptions.\nFinancial Risks\nCurrency fluctuations affect our operating profits.\nOur earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $1.9 million to $2.1 million annually.\nWe also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $2.9 million to $3.1 million annually.\nIn addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar against the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $34.3 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.\nWe may experience impairments of goodwill or other intangible assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $648.6 million and other intangible assets of $307.5 million.\nOur business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. We make estimates and assumptions in valuing such intangible assets that affect our consolidated financial statements.\n20\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The evaluation may be based on valuation models that estimate fair value. In preparing the valuation models, we consider a number of factors, including operating results, business plans, economic conditions, future cash flows, and transaction and market data. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. The significant estimates and assumptions within our fair value models include sales growth, controllable cost growth, perpetual growth, effective tax rates, and discount rates. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.\nShould any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.\nOur amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.\nConcerns regarding the Eurozone debt levels and market perception related to the instability of the euro could affect our operating profits.\nWe conduct business in many countries that use the euro as their currency (the Eurozone). Concerns persist regarding the debt burden of certain Eurozone countries and their ability to meet future financial obligations. In addition, concerns in recent years have existed regarding the overall stability of the euro and the suitability of the euro as a single currency given the diverse economic and political circumstances in individual Eurozone countries.\nThese concerns could lead to the re-introduction of individual currencies in one or more Eurozone countries or, in more extreme circumstances, the possible dissolution of the euro currency entirely. Should the euro dissolve entirely, the legal and contractual consequences for holders of euro-denominated obligations would be determined by laws in effect at such time. These potential developments, or market perceptions concerning these and related issues, could adversely affect the value of our euro-denominated assets and obligations. In addition, concerns over the effect of this type of financial crisis on financial institutions in Europe and globally could have an adverse effect on the global capital markets and, more specifically, on the ability of our Company, our customers, suppliers, and lenders to finance their respective businesses and to access liquidity at acceptable financing costs, if at all, on the availability of supplies and materials, and on the demand for our products. For information on the impact of the United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union, see \"Risk Factors — The United Kingdom's withdrawal from the European Union could adversely impact our results of operations.\"\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory, and Other Risks\nUnanticipated changes in our tax rates or additional income tax liabilities could impact our profitability.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various other jurisdictions, and our domestic and international tax liabilities are subject to allocation of expenses among different jurisdictions. Our effective tax rates and tax obligations could be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or rates (including the potential implementation of various U.S. tax proposals), changes in the mix of earnings by jurisdiction, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and material adjustments from tax audits.\n21\nIn particular, the carrying value of deferred tax assets, which are predominantly in the U.S., is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income in the U.S. In addition, the amount of income taxes we pay is subject to ongoing audits in various jurisdictions, and a material assessment by a governing tax authority could affect our profitability.\nOur tax expense and tax obligations could increase as a result of changing application of tax law.\nGovernments are facing greater pressure on public finances, which could lead to their more aggressively applying existing tax laws and regulations. Governments also periodically change tax laws and regulations.\nThe Organization for Economic Co-Operation and Development (OECD) has recently proposed changes to the current transfer pricing arm’s length standard for allocating profit as well as a 15% minimum tax by jurisdiction. While the provision to alter the way profit is allocated by jurisdiction is not expected to impact the Company, the 15% minimum tax by jurisdiction may adversely impact the Company's global tax provision. Additionally, the U.S. has proposed certain changes in the way U.S. multinational companies are taxed, which may also result in higher tax obligations.\nAny changes in corporate income tax rates or regulations, on repatriation of dividends, earnings, share repurchases, or capital, or on transfer pricing, as well as changes in the interpretation of existing tax laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate, could adversely affect our cash flow and increase our overall tax burden, which would negatively affect our profitability. Potential OECD changes impacting consumer businesses could also have an unfavorable effect on some of our key customer segments such as pharmaceutical and food and beverage, which could result in a decline or delay in capital spending by our customers and a resulting decline in our revenues and profitability.\nWe may be adversely affected by failure to comply with regulations of governmental agencies or by the adoption of new regulations. United States trade policy, including the imposition of tariffs and the resulting consequences, as well as other political policies in the United States, China, the U.K., and certain European countries, may also impact global trade or create uncertainty impacting our business.\nOur products are subject to regulation by governmental agencies. These regulations govern a wide variety of activities relating to our products, including design and development, product safety, labeling, manufacturing, promotion, sales, and distribution. We also operate a global business and are subject to various laws and regulations in the many markets where we do business, including those relating to competition, employment and labor practices, international trade, and corruption. If we fail to comply with these regulations, or if new regulations are adopted that substantially change existing practice or impose new burdens, we may have to recall products and cease their manufacture and distribution. In addition, we could be subject to investigation costs, reputational harm, fines, criminal prosecution, and other damages that could impact our profitability.\nPolitical policy in the United States, China, the U.K., and certain European countries may impact global trade and domestic purchasing or create uncertainty. The United States government has adopted a new approach to trade policy and in certain cases has sought to renegotiate, or possibly terminate, certain existing trade agreements. The United States government has also initiated tariffs on certain foreign goods, particularly those produced in China. As a result, certain foreign governments, including the Chinese government, have imposed retaliatory tariffs on goods that their countries import from the United States. Certain governments also have implemented domestic purchasing requirements that could favor local competition and result in reduced sales.\n22\nThese various trade policy and regulatory actions described above may restrict our access to lower-cost countries in certain circumstances or otherwise create uncertainty, negatively impact global markets, and make it more difficult or costly for us to import our products into certain countries. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies could also lead to an economic downturn and/or could create unfavorable fluctuations in currency exchange rates (see above description \"Currency fluctuations affect our operating profits.\"). In times of uncertainty, some customers delay investments or defer normal replacement cycles, which could have an adverse impact on our sales. The adoption and expansion of trade restrictions or other governmental action related to tariffs or trade agreements or policies have the potential to adversely impact our business and financial performance.\nThe United Kingdom\n’\ns withdrawal from the European Union could adversely impact our results of operations.\nOn January 31, 2020, the U.K. formally left the E.U. (commonly referred to as Brexit). After a transition period, on December 24, 2020, the U.K. and E.U. agreed to a trade deal (the Trade and Cooperation Agreement), which was ratified by the U.K. on December 30, 2020. This Trade and Cooperation Agreement came into effect on May 1, 2021 after it was ratified by both the European Parliament and Council of the European Union. The Trade and Cooperation Agreement allows the U.K. and E.U. to continue trading without tariffs or quotas; however, the movement of goods between the U.K. and the remaining member states of the E.U. may be subject to additional inspections and documentation checks, leading to possible delays at ports of entry and departure.\nIn addition, there are still a number of areas of uncertainty in connection with the future of the U.K. and its relationship with the E.U. and the application and interpretation of the Trade and Cooperation Agreement, and Brexit-related matters may take several years to be clarified and resolved. In particular, the Trade and Cooperation Agreement only covers the trade of goods and, therefore, uncertainty remains over the U.K.'s long-term trading of services relationship with the E.U. At this time, we cannot predict the potential impact of Brexit on our business. However, Brexit could adversely affect our operating results and financial condition.\nIf we cannot protect our intellectual property rights, or if we infringe or misappropriate the proprietary rights of others, our operating results could be harmed.\nOur success depends on our ability to obtain, maintain, and enforce patents on our technology, maintain our trademarks, and protect our trade secrets. Our patents may not provide complete protection or may expire, and competitors may develop similar products that are not covered by our patents. Our patents may also be challenged by third parties and invalidated or narrowed. We may experience a decline in sales and/or profitability if any of these things occur. Competitors sometimes seek to take advantage of our trademarks or brands in ways that may create customer confusion or weaken our brand. Improper use or disclosure of our trade secrets may still occur.\nWe may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others. The cost of any litigation could affect our profitability regardless of the outcome, and management attention could be diverted. If we are unsuccessful in such litigation, we may have to pay damages, stop the infringing activity, and/or obtain a license. If we fail to obtain a required license, we may be unable to sell some of our products, which could result in a decline in our revenues.\nWe may be adversely affected by environmental laws and regulations.\nWe are subject to various environmental laws and regulations and incur expenditures in complying with environmental laws and regulations. We have corporate programs in place to manage compliance and stakeholder expectations related to environmental matters, but increasing public interest in climate change\n23\ntopics may result in the enactment of additional governmental laws and regulations related to this subject area. We are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in various facilities. In addition, some of our facilities are or have been in operation for many decades and may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes that are hazardous or may be considered hazardous in the future. These sites and disposal sites owned by others to which we sent waste may in the future be identified as contaminated and require remediation. Accordingly, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that may harm our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe may be adversely affected by regulations and market expectations related to sourcing and our supply chain, including conflict minerals.\nThe SEC has adopted disclosures and reporting requirements for companies whose products contain certain minerals and their derivatives, namely tin, tantalum, tungsten, or gold, known as conflict minerals. Companies must report annually whether or not such minerals originate from the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and adjoining countries. These requirements could adversely affect the sourcing, availability, and pricing of materials used in the manufacturing of our products. In addition, we have incurred additional costs to comply with the disclosure requirements, including cost related to determining the source of any of the relevant minerals used in our products. Since our supply chain is complex, due diligence procedures we have implemented to understand the origins of the minerals we use in our operations may not enable us to ascertain with sufficient certainty the origins for these minerals or determine that these minerals are DRC conflict free, which may harm our reputation. We may also face difficulties in satisfying customers and other stakeholders who may require that our products be certified as DRC conflict free, which could harm our relationships with these customers and/or lead to a loss of revenue. These requirements also could have the effect of limiting the pool of suppliers from which we source these minerals, and we may be unable to obtain conflict-free minerals at prices similar to the past, which could increase our costs and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and our profitability.\nFuture laws, regulations, or customers may make additional demands on supply chain transparency. These demands can include more transparency into the activities of our suppliers with regard to human rights and sustainable sourcing. We have significant protections in place to ensure we partner with responsible suppliers, but increased demands may cause us to incur increased supply chain costs. If we cannot satisfy customers’ demands, we may lose business, and if we cannot meet new regulatory requirements, we may have to alter our sourcing at increased expense.\nOur ability to generate and repatriate cash depends in part on factors beyond our control.\nOur ability to make payments on our debt and to fund our share repurchase program, planned capital expenditures, and research and development efforts depends on our ability to generate and repatriate cash in the future. This is subject to factors beyond our control, including general economic, financial, competitive, legislative, regulatory, governmental, and other factors described in this section.\nWe cannot ensure that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations or that future borrowings will be available to us under our credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our debt or to fund our other liquidity needs. We may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. We cannot ensure that we will be able to refinance any of our debt, including our credit facility and the senior notes, on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nOur ability to fund our share repurchase program is also dependent on our ability to repatriate our international cash flows. Changes in governmental cash repatriation policies, restrictions, or tax laws could impair our ability to continue our share repurchase program.\n24\nRisks Related to Our Debt\nWe have debt and we may incur substantially more debt, which could affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and may otherwise restrict our activities.\nWe have debt and we may incur substantial additional debt in the future. As of December 31, 2021, we had total indebtedness of approximately $1.6 billion, net of cash of $98.6 million. Our debt instruments allow us to incur substantial additional indebtedness.\nThe existence and magnitude of our debt could have important consequences. For example, it could make it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our debt instruments; require us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to payments on our indebtedness, which would reduce the amount of cash flow available to fund working capital, capital expenditures, product development, and other corporate requirements; increase our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions, including changes in raw material costs; limit our ability to respond to business opportunities; limit our ability to borrow additional funds, which may be necessary; and subject us to financial and other restrictive covenants, which, if we fail to comply with these covenants and our failure is not waived or cured, could result in an event of default under our debt instruments.\nThe agreements governing our debt impose restrictions on our business.\nThe note purchase agreements governing our notes and the agreements governing our credit facility contain covenants imposing various restrictions on our business. These restrictions may affect our ability to operate our business and may limit our ability to take advantage of potential business opportunities. The restrictions these covenants place on us include limitations on our ability to incur liens and consolidate, merge, sell, or lease all or substantially all of our assets. Our credit facility and the note purchase agreements governing our senior notes also require us to meet certain financial ratios.\nOur ability to comply with these agreements may be affected by events beyond our control, including economic, financial, and industry conditions. The breach of any covenants or restrictions could result in a default under the note purchase agreements governing the senior notes and/or under our credit facility. An event of default under the agreements governing our debt would permit holders of our debt to declare all amounts owed to them under such agreements to be immediately due and payable. Acceleration of our other indebtedness may cause us to be unable to make interest payments on the senior notes and repay the principal amount of the senior notes.\nThe lenders under our credit agreement may be unable to meet their funding commitments, reducing the amount of our borrowing capacity.\nWe have a revolving credit facility outstanding under which the Company and certain of its subsidiaries may borrow up to $1.25 billion. Our credit facility is provided by a group of 14 financial institutions, which individually have between 4% and 11% of the total funding commitment. At December 31, 2021, we had borrowings of $601.0 million outstanding under our credit facility. Our ability to borrow further funds under our credit facility is subject to the various lenders’ financial condition and ability to make funds available. Even though the financial institutions are contractually obligated to lend funds, if one or more of the lenders encounters financial difficulties or goes bankrupt, such lenders may be unable to meet their obligations. This could result in us being unable to borrow the full $1.25 billion amount available.\nWe are subject to risks associated with the discontinuation of LIBOR.\nThe U.K. Financial Conduct Authority announced in 2017 that it intended to phase out the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) by the end of 2021. On November 30, 2020, to facilitate an orderly LIBOR transition, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit Insurance\n25\nCorporation, and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve jointly announced that entering into new contracts using LIBOR as a reference rate after December 31, 2021 would create a safety and soundness risk. On March 5, 2021, the Financial Conduct Authority announced that all LIBOR benchmarks will either no longer be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative after December 31, 2021 in the case of one-week and two-month U.S. dollar LIBOR, and after June 30, 2023 in the case of the remaining U.S. dollar LIBOR benchmarks. As mentioned in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, our current interest rate swap, cross currency swap, and credit agreements include fallback protocols when LIBOR is discontinued. Changes in the method of calculating LIBOR, or the replacement of LIBOR with an alternative rate or benchmark, may adversely affect interest rates and could result in higher borrowing costs. In addition, if changes are made to the method of calculating LIBOR or LIBOR ceases to exist, we may need to amend certain contracts, including our credit facility and swap arrangements, and we cannot predict what alternative rate or benchmark would be negotiated. This may also result in an increase in our interest expense.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nWe make forward-looking statements, and actual events or results may differ materially from these statements because assumptions we have made prove incorrect due to market conditions in our industries or other factors.\nWe provide forward-looking statements both in our filings with the SEC and orally in connection with our quarterly earnings calls, including guidance on anticipated sales growth and earnings per share. You should not rely on forward-looking statements to predict our actual results. Our actual results or performance may be materially different than reflected in forward-looking statements because of various risks and uncertainties.\nOur forward-looking statements may not be accurate or complete, and we do not intend to update or revise them in light of actual results. New risks also periodically arise. Please consider the risks and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from what is described in our forward-looking statements. See in particular “Factors Affecting Our Future Operating Results” and “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nIn providing guidance on our future earnings, we evaluate our budgets, strategic plans, and other factors relating to our business. We make assumptions about external factors, including the following:\n•\nthe outlook for our end-markets and the global economy;\n•\nthe impact of external factors on our competition;\n•\nthe financial position of our customers and their willingness to pay for our products and services;\n•\nthe estimated costs of purchasing materials;\n•\nthe estimated costs of transportation and logistics;\n•\ndevelopments in personnel costs;\n•\nour estimated income tax expense; and\n•\nrates for currency exchange, particularly between the Swiss franc and the euro and between the Chinese renminbi and the U.S. dollar.\nSome of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect over time. For example, although no single end-customer accounts for more than 1% of our revenues, if a number of our customers experienced significant deteriorations in their financial positions concurrently, it could have an impact on our results of operations.\n26\nSome of our key internal assumptions include the following:\n•\nour ability to implement our business strategy;\n•\nour ability to implement price increases as forecasted;\n•\nthe effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs such as our Spinnaker, market penetration, and Field Turbo initiatives;\n•\nthe effectiveness of our programs to improve our service business, including growth, globalization, and productivity initiatives;\n•\nour ability to develop and deliver innovative products and services;\n•\nthe continued growth of our sales in emerging markets; and\n•\nthe effectiveness of productivity and cost saving initiatives.\nThese internal assumptions may also prove to be incorrect over time. For example, with respect to our ability to realize our planned price increases without disturbing our customer base in core markets, in certain markets, such as emerging markets, price tends to be a more significant factor in customers’ decisions to purchase our products and services. Furthermore, we can have no assurance that our cost reduction programs will generate adequate cost savings. Additionally, it may become necessary to take additional restructuring actions resulting in additional restructuring costs.\nWe believe our current assumptions are reasonable and prudent for planning purposes. However, should any of these assumptions prove to be incorrect, or should we incur lower-than-expected operating performance or cash flows, we may experience results different than our projections."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with our consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in local currencies exclude the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations. Local currency amounts are determined by translating current and previous year consolidated financial information at an index utilizing historical currency exchange rates. We believe local currency information provides a helpful assessment of business performance and a useful measure of results between periods. We do not, nor do we suggest that investors should, consider such non-GAAP financial measures in isolation from, or as a substitute for, financial information prepared in accordance with GAAP. We present non-GAAP financial measures in reporting our financial results to provide investors with an additional analytical tool to evaluate our operating results.\nWe also include in the discussion below disclosures of immaterial qualitative factors that are not quantified. Although the impact of such factors is not considered material, we believe these disclosures can be useful in evaluating our operating results.\n31\nOverview\nWe operate a global business with sales that are diversified by geographic region, product range, and customer. We hold leading positions worldwide in many of our markets and attribute this leadership to several factors, including the strength of our brand name and reputation, our comprehensive offering of innovative instruments and solutions, our Spinnaker sales and marketing program, and the breadth and quality of our global sales and service network.\nNet sales in U.S. dollars increased 21% in 2021 and 3% in 2020. Excluding the effect of currency exchange rate fluctuations, or in local currencies, net sales increased 18% in 2021 and 2% in 2020. In 2021, we experienced broad-based growth with robust customer demand in most businesses and regions as global economies recovered from COVID-19. We also benefited from excellent execution of our sales and marketing programs and effectively navigated supply chain challenges to meet heightened customer demand. Growth in China was particularly strong. We continue to benefit from our strong global leadership positions, diversified customer base, innovative product offering, investment in emerging markets, significant installed base, and the impact of our sophisticated global sales and marketing programs. Examples of these programs include identifying and investing in growth and market penetration opportunities, more effectively pricing our products and services, increasing our sales force effectiveness through improved guidance and redirecting resources to our most promising growth opportunities, increasing digitalization tools, and continuing to optimize our lead generation and lead nurturing processes.\nDuring the past two years, we accelerated our ability to use advanced analytics to identify and pursue growth opportunities, while increasing the effectiveness of our digital tools to support our global sales organization. We have also successfully adapted to remote and hybrid work environments and increased engagement with our customers with our Go-to-Market and digital approaches. While global market conditions are currently favorable, challenges remain in the global supply chain and we will face difficult prior period comparisons in 2022 due to strong results in 2021. Uncertainties and challenges relating to COVID-19 also continue, including new variants (such as Omicron), lockdowns, logistical and inflationary challenges, and the potential impact on global economies, and market conditions may change quickly.\nOur laboratory sales experienced excellent growth in 2021, particularly from life sciences and biotech customers, while other end-markets such as the chemical industry experienced a strong recovery. We also continue to support COVID-19 testing, development, treatment, and vaccine production activities in biopharma. We expect to continue to benefit from favorable biopharma market trends. We also believe we will benefit from increased customer demand for automation, digitalization, and safety; new facility investments; and continued focus on regulatory compliance including data integrity requirements. Overall, we believe we are well positioned to continue to capture growth and gain market share in our laboratory business.\nOur industrial sales experienced strong growth in 2021 in both core industrial and product inspection. Core industrial experienced particularly strong growth, especially in China and the Americas. We continue to benefit from our strong product offering and focus on the more attractive, faster-growing segments of the market and strong execution of our growth initiatives in each region.\nWe also continue to benefit from market trends in automation and digitalization. Emerging market economies, especially China, have historically been an important source of growth based upon the expansion of their domestic economies, and we expect this to be a continued source of future growth. Our core industrial-related products are also especially sensitive to changes in economic growth. Our product inspection business experienced improved customer demand during 2021 after being negatively impacted by COVID-19 in 2020. We\n32\nexpect our product inspection end-market to also benefit from our customers’ focus on brand protection, food safety, and productivity.\nOur food retailing sales decreased during 2021 primarily due to weak market dynamics, the timing of project activity, and the negative impact of component shortages. Traditionally, the spending levels in this sector have experienced more volatility than our other end-markets due to the timing of customer project activity and new regulations.\nIn 2022, we will continue to pursue the overall business growth strategies which we have followed in recent years:\nGaining Market Share.\nInnovation is essential to gaining market share and is fundamental in all aspects of our business including sales and marketing and technology leadership\n.\nOur global sales and marketing initiative, Spinnaker, continues to be an important growth strategy. We aim to gain market share by implementing sophisticated sales and marketing programs, leveraging our extensive customer databases, and leveraging our product offering to larger customers through key account management. While this initiative is broad-based, efforts to improve these processes include the use of advanced data analytics to identify, prioritize, and pursue growth opportunities; the implementation of more effective pricing and value-based selling strategies and processes; improved sales force guidance, training and effectiveness; cross-selling; increased segment marketing; and leads generation and nurturing activities. We have also added field sales and service resources to pursue underpenetrated market opportunities and will make additional investments to front-end resources in 2022. We also continue to adapt our Go-to-Market approaches with additional inside and telesales resources, while also increasing digital customer interaction. We continue to benefit from digitalization tools to gain efficiencies and increase the effectiveness of our field sales force. In addition, our comprehensive service offerings, and our initiatives to globalize and harmonize these offerings, help us further penetrate developed markets. We estimate that we have the largest installed base of weighing instruments in the world, and we continue to leverage advanced data analytics and invest in sales and marketing activities to increase the proportion of our installed base that is under service contract, or sell new products that replace old products in our installed base. In addition to traditional repair and maintenance, our service offerings continue to expand into value-added services for a range of market needs, including regulatory compliance. We have also made adjustments to our service model to incorporate remote service, depot drop-off/pickup, and other approaches to ensure the safety of our technicians and customers.\nExpanding Emerging Markets.\nEmerging markets, comprising Asia (excluding Japan), Eastern Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa, account for approximately 36% of our total net sales. We have a two-pronged strategy in emerging markets: first, to capitalize on long-term growth opportunities in these markets, and second, to leverage our low-cost manufacturing operations in China. We have nearly a 35-year track record in China, and our sales in Asia have grown more than 13% on a compound annual growth basis in local currencies since 1999. Over the years, we have also broadened our product offering to the Asian markets. India has also been a source of emerging market sales growth in past years due to increased life science research activities. Overall, versus the prior year, we experienced a 20% increase in emerging market local currency sales by destination during 2021, which included 25% local currency sales growth in China. Within China, we continue to redeploy resources and sales and marketing efforts to the faster-growing segments of pharma, food manufacturing, chemical, and environment. We believe the long-term growth of these segments will be favorably impacted by the Chinese government’s emphasis on science, high-value industries, product quality, and food safety. We expect our laboratory and product inspection businesses will particularly benefit from our focus on these segments. We also continue to invest and add sales and marketing resources to pursue growth in under-penetrated emerging markets. However, emerging market sales can be volatile. In particular, China has historically been volatile and market conditions may change unfavorably due to various factors.\n33\nExtending Our Technology Lead.\nWe continue to focus on product innovation. In the last three years, we spent approximately 5% of net sales on research and development. We seek to improve our product offerings and their capabilities with additional integrated technologies and software, which we believe supports our pricing differentiation and accelerates product replacement cycles. In addition, we aim to create value for our customers by having thorough knowledge of their processes via our significant installed product base.\nExpanding Our Margins.\nDuring 2021, we experienced increased inflation in our cost structure, particularly regarding material product costs and transportation and logistics, and we expect our cost structure to further increase in 2022 due to these inflationary dynamics. However, despite these challenges to our cost structure, we continue to strive to improve our margins by more effectively pricing our products and services, optimizing our cost structure, and improving our mix in higher-margin businesses such as service. For example, sophisticated data analytic tools provide us new insights to further refine our price strategies and processes. We also focus on reallocating resources and better aligning our cost structure to support our investments in market penetration initiatives, higher-growth/profitable areas, and opportunities for margin improvement.\nWe have also initiated various cost reduction programs over the past few years, including temporary cost containment measures during 2020 in response to COVID-19. We have also implemented global procurement and supply chain management programs over the last several years aimed at lowering supply costs, and have increased our focus on these programs with our SternDrive initiative. SternDrive is our global operational excellence program for continuous improvement efforts within our supply chain, manufacturing, and back-office operations. Blue Ocean is also an important enabler of our various margin expansion initiatives. Our move to standardized business processes, systems, and data structures throughout our global organization provides greater data transparency and faster access to real-time data. Our cost leadership and productivity initiatives are also focused on continuously improving our invested capital efficiency, such as reducing our working capital levels, improving our order to cash cycle, and ensuring appropriate returns on our expenditures.\nPursuing Strategic Acquisitions.\nWe seek to pursue \"bolt-on\" acquisitions that may leverage our global sales and service network, respected brand, extensive distribution channels, and technological leadership. We have identified life sciences, process analytics, and product inspection as three key areas for acquisitions. For example, in March 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the United States. The initial cash payment was $185.0 million and we made other post-closing payments of $7.4 million. We may be required to pay additional consideration of up to $20.0 million. In October 2021, we also acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets. The initial cash payment was $20.2 million and we may be required to pay additional amounts up to EUR 3.0 million.\nCOVID-19\nSince late 2019, the coronavirus pandemic (COVID-19) has spread globally in all countries where we conduct business. The COVID-19 pandemic is evolving and has led to the implementation of various responses, including government-imposed quarantines, stay-at-home orders and lockdowns, travel restrictions, vaccination and testing requirements, and other public health safety measures. These restrictions continue to change as COVID-19 evolves, variants are discovered, and vaccinations are distributed in each country and region. The emergence of the Omicron variant of COVID-19 in late 2021 has presented particular challenges to the global economy given its high level of transmissibility, which\n34\ncan cause many people to be affected at the same time or over a short period of time, leading to potential disruptions to our business and supply chain.\nThe health and safety of our employees and business partners have been our highest priority throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, and we have implemented several preventative and protective measures. We also have continued to support our customers with their essential businesses, such as life sciences, food manufacturing, chemicals (e.g., sanitizers, disinfectants, soaps, etc.), food retail, and transportation and logistics.\nOur production and logistics facilities are currently operational, and our office-based employees continue to adhere to any applicable jurisdictional stay-at-home orders. Our supply chain is currently facing wide-ranging global challenges, although we have been able to meet delivery requirements of our customers with some interruption. We continue to closely monitor risks associated with our supply chain, including the availability of certain components, material shortages, supplier delays, potential transportation delays, and higher transportation and material costs, which could significantly adversely affect sales and/or profitability in future quarters. We also continue to leverage our digital and remote sales capabilities, and our service organization continues to provide on-site and remote customer support to facilitate uptime, productivity, and regulatory compliance.\nCOVID-19 presents several risks to our business as further described on page 14 in the Risk Factors section of this Form 10-K. Uncertainties related to COVID-19 and the resulting impact to the global economy continue in most regions of the world, and market conditions can change quickly. The longer-term effects on our business will be influenced by the global economy and any economic implications in different regions of the world.\nResults of Operations — Consolidated\nNet sales\nNet sales were $3.7 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $3.1 billion in 2020 and $3.0 billion in 2019. This represents an increase of 21% in 2021 and 3% in 2020 in U.S. dollars and an increase of 18% in 2021 and 2% in 2020 in local currencies. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed 1% to our net sales in 2021. In 2021, we experienced broad-based growth with robust customer demand in most businesses and regions, with particularly strong growth in China. We continue to benefit from the execution of our global sales and marketing programs, our innovative product portfolio, and investments in our field organization, particularly surrounding digital tools and techniques. However, uncertainties and challenges relating to COVID-19 continue, including new variants (such as Omicron), lockdowns, supply chain and inflationary challenges, and the potential impact on global economies, and market conditions may change quickly.\nIn 2021, our net sales by geographic destination increased in U.S. dollars compared to 2020 by 20% in the Americas, 15% in Europe, and 26% in Asia/Rest of World. In local currencies, our net sales by geographic destination increased in 2021 by 20% in the Americas, 12% in Europe, and 21% in Asia/Rest of World, with 25% growth in China. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 2% to net sales in the Americas and 1% to net sales in Europe during 2021. A discussion of sales by operating segment is included below.\nAs described in Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements, our net sales comprise product sales of precision instruments and related services. Service revenues are primarily derived from repair and other services, including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, preventative maintenance, and spare parts.\n35\nNet sales of products increased 23% in U.S. dollars and 20% in local currencies during 2021 and increased 2% in both U.S. dollars and in local currencies in 2020. The PendoTECH acquisition contributed approximately 1% to our net sales of products during 2021. Service revenue (including spare parts) increased 11% in U.S. dollars and 8% in local currencies in 2021 and increased 3% in U.S. dollars and 2% in local currencies in 2020.\nNet sales of our laboratory products and services, which represented approximately 56% of our total net sales in 2021, increased 25% in U.S. dollars and 22% in local currencies during 2021. The local currency increase in net sales of our laboratory-related products during 2021 includes very strong growth in most product categories, especially in pipettes and process analytics. Net sales of our laboratory products also benefited approximately 2% from the PendoTECH acquisition.\nNet sales of our industrial products and services, which represented approximately 39% of our total net sales in 2021, increased 18% in U.S. dollars and 15% in local currencies during 2021. The local currency increase in net sales of our industrial-related products during 2021 includes strong growth in most product categories, with particularly strong growth in core industrial, especially in China and the Americas.\nNet sales of our food retailing products and services, which represented approximately 5% of our total net sales in 2021, decreased 3% in U.S. dollars and 6% in local currencies during 2021. The decline in food retailing is primarily due to weak market dynamics, the timing of project activity, and the negative impact of component shortages.\nGross profit\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales was 58.4% for both 2021 and 2020 and 57.9% for 2019.\nGross profit as a percentage of net sales for products was 60.1% for 2021, compared to 60.3% for 2020 and 60.4% for 2019. Gross profit as a percentage of net sales for services (including spare parts) was 51.8% for 2021, compared to 51.6% for 2020 and 49.0% for 2019.\nThe gross profit as a percentage of net sales for 2021 reflects increased sales volume and favorable price realization, offset by higher material and transportation costs in 2021 and temporary cost savings in 2020.\nResearch and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses\nResearch and development expenses as a percentage of net sales were 4.6% for 2021, 4.5% for 2020, and 4.8% for 2019. Research and development expenses in U.S. dollars increased 21% in 2021 and decreased 3% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 17% in 2021 and decreased 5% in 2020. The increase during 2021 primarily relates to increased project activity and temporary savings in the prior year.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 25.4% for 2021, compared to 26.6% for 2020 and 27.2% for 2019. Selling, general, and administrative expenses increased 15% in U.S. dollars and increased 12% in local currencies in 2021 and were flat in U.S. dollars and decreased 1% in local currencies in 2020. The increase during 2021 primarily includes higher cash incentive expense, temporary savings in the prior year, and increased sales and marketing investments.\nAmortization expense\nAmortization expense was $63.1 million in 2021, compared to $56.7 million and $49.7 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. The increase in amortization expense primarily includes intangible assets related to the PendoTECH acquisition, as well as our investments in information technology, including our Blue Ocean program.\n36\nRestructuring charges\nDuring the past few years, we initiated various cost reduction measures. Restructuring charges were  $5.2 million in 2021, compared to $10.5 million and $15.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Restructuring expenses are primarily comprised of employee-related costs.\nOther charges (income), net\nOther charges (income), net consisted of net income of $3.1 million, $13.8 million, and $6.2 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities, interest income, and other items. Non-service pension benefits were $11.4 million, $12.2 million, and $4.8 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Other charges (income), net also includes $3.4 million of acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as a $6.8 million charge to increase the PendoTECH acquisition contingent consideration and related obligations to the sellers.\nInterest expense and taxes\nInterest expense was $43.2 million for 2021, compared to $38.6 million for 2020 and $37.4 million for\n2019.\nOur reported tax rate was 19% during 2021, compared to 19.5% and 17.7% during 2020 and 2019, respectively. The 2019 reported tax rate includes a net benefit of $15.8 million associated with Swiss tax reform described below.\nIn May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved Swiss federal tax reform proposals previously approved by the Swiss Parliament. Additional changes in Swiss cantonal law were enacted in October 2019. The changes in Swiss federal tax had an immaterial effect on our financial statements. We recognized a discrete non-cash net deferred tax benefit of $15.8 million as a result of the enactment of the cantonal law in the fourth quarter of 2019. A further description of Swiss tax reform is in Note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.\nResults of Operations — by Operating Segment\nThe following is a discussion of the financial results of our operating segments. We currently have five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations, and Other. A more detailed description of these segments is outlined in Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.\nU.S. Operations (amounts in thousands)\nTotal net sales increased 21% in 2021 and 2% in 2020 and net sales to external customers increased 20% in 2021 and 1% in 2020. The increase during 2021 is driven by very strong growth in most product categories, especially laboratory and core industrial. These results were partially offset by a significant decline in food retailing that was impacted by weak market dynamics, the timing of customer project\n37\nactivity, and component shortages. Net sales to external customers in our U.S. Operations also benefited approximately 3% from the PendoTECH acquisition.\nSegment profit increased $57.2 million in our U.S. Operations segment during 2021, compared to an increase of $34.8 million during 2020. The segment profit increase in 2021 includes higher sales volume and benefits from our margin expansion initiatives, offset in part by higher transportation and material costs and temporary cost savings in the prior year.\nSwiss Operations (amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nRepresents U.S. dollar growth.\nTotal net sales in U.S. dollars increased 21% in 2021 and 3% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 19% in 2021 and decreased 2% in 2020. Net sales to external customers in U.S. dollars increased 19% in 2021 and increased 3% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 17% in 2021 and decreased 1% in 2020. Local currency net sales to external customers during 2021 includes strong growth in most product categories.\nSegment profit increased $55.7 million in our Swiss Operations segment during 2021, compared to an increase of $12.2 million during 2020. The segment profit increase in 2021 includes higher sales volume, benefits from our productivity initiatives, and favorable foreign currency translation, offset in part by higher transportation and material costs and temporary cost savings in the prior year.\nWestern European Operations (amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nRepresents U.S. dollar growth.\nTotal net sales in U.S. dollars increased 17% in 2021 and 2% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 12% in 2021 and decreased 1% in 2020. Net sales to external customers in U.S. dollars increased 16% in 2021 and increased 2% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 12% in 2021 and were flat in 2020. Local currency net sales to external customers during 2021 includes strong growth in most product categories, especially in laboratory-related products.\nSegment profit increased $24.7 million in our Western European Operations segment during 2021, compared to an increase of $23.7 million in 2020. The segment profit increase in 2021 is primarily due to higher sales volume, benefits from our margin expansion initiatives, and favorable currency translation, offset in part by higher transportation and material costs and temporary cost savings in the prior year.\n38\nChinese Operations (amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nRepresents U.S. dollar growth.\nTotal net sales in U.S. dollars increased 34% in 2021 and increased 3% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 26% in 2021 and 3% in 2020. Net sales by origin to external customers in U.S. dollars increased 33% in 2021 and 6% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 25% in 2021 and 6% in 2020. The increase in net sales to external customers during 2021 reflects particularly strong growth in both laboratory and industrial products. However, market conditions may change quickly and we will face difficult prior period comparisons in 2022.\nSegment profit increased $99.3 million in our Chinese Operations segment during 2021, compared to an increase of $4.0 million in 2020. The increase in segment profit during 2021 primarily reflects increased sales volume, benefits from our margin expansion initiatives, and favorable foreign currency translation, offset in part by higher transportation and material costs and temporary cost savings in the prior year.\nOther (amounts in thousands)\n(1)\nRepresents U.S. dollar growth.\nOther includes reporting units in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and other countries. Net sales to external customers in U.S. dollars increased 14% in 2021 and 1% in 2020, and in local currencies increased 12% in 2021 and 2% in 2020. The increase in local currency growth in net sales to external customers during 2021 includes strong growth in most product categories.\nSegment profit increased $22.1 million in our Other segment during 2021, compared to an increase of $6.4 million during 2020. The increase in segment profit during 2021 primarily relates to increased sales volume and favorable foreign currency translation.\nLiquidity, Capital Resources, and Future Cash Requirements\nLiquidity is our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our obligations and commitments.   Sources of liquidity include cash flows from operating activities, available borrowings under our Credit Agreement, the ability to obtain appropriate financing, and our cash and cash equivalent balances. Currently, our financing requirements are primarily driven by working capital requirements, capital expenditures, share repurchases, and acquisitions. Global market conditions can be uncertain, and our ability to generate cash flows could be reduced by a deterioration in global markets.\nWe currently believe that cash flows from operating activities, together with liquidity available under our Credit Agreement, local working capital facilities, and cash balances, will be sufficient to fund currently anticipated working capital needs and spending requirements for at least the foreseeable future.\n39\nCash provided by operating activities totaled $908.8 million in 2021, compared to $724.7 million in 2020 and $603.5 million in 2019. The increase in 2021 is primarily due to higher net earnings.\nCapital expenditures are made primarily for investments in information systems and technology, machinery, equipment, and the purchase and expansion of facilities. Our capital expenditures totaled $107.6 million in 2021, $92.5 million in 2020, and $97.3 million in 2019. Capital expenditures are expected to increase in 2022 similarly as we experienced in 2021, subject to business and economic conditions.\nIn September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. The Company will receive funding of $35.8 million over the next two years, which will offset future capital expenditures.\nWe continue to explore potential acquisitions. In connection with any acquisition, we may incur additional indebtedness. In March 2021, we acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the United States. The initial cash payment was $185.0 million and we made other post-closing payments of $7.4 million. We may be required to pay additional consideration of up to $20.0 million. In October 2021, the Company acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets. The initial cash payment was $20.2 million and the Company may be required to pay additional amounts up to EUR 3.0 million. For additional information related to these acquisitions, refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2021, 2020, and 2019, we also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling $8.3 million, $6.2 million, and $2.0 million, respectively.\nCash flows used in financing activities during 2021 primarily comprised share repurchases. In accordance with our share repurchase program, we spent $1.0 billion in 2021 and $775 million in both 2020 and 2019 on the repurchase of 739,486 shares, 815,652 shares, and 1,094,648 shares, respectively. Our share repurchase program does not obligate us to acquire any specific number of shares; however, in 2022, we intend to spend a similar amount on the repurchase of shares as we spent in 2021, subject to business and economic conditions.\nWe plan to continue to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and expect the only additional cost associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings will be withholding taxes. All other undistributed earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested. We believe the ongoing tax impact associated with repatriating our undistributed foreign earnings will not have a material effect on our liquidity.\n40\nSenior Notes and Credit Facility Agreement\nOur short-term borrowings and long-term debt consisted of the following at December 31, 2021:\n(1) See Note 6 and Note 7 to our consolidated financial statements for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the Credit Agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $649.0 million of additional borrowings were available under our Credit Agreement and we maintained $98.6 million of cash and cash equivalents. We expect to make interest payments of approximately $50 million during 2022 associated with our debt outstanding as of December 31, 2021.\nChanges in exchange rates between the currencies in which we generate cash flow and the currencies in which our borrowings are denominated affect our liquidity. In addition, because we borrow in a variety of currencies, our debt balances fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates. Further, we do not have any downgrade triggers from rating agencies that would accelerate the maturity dates of our debt. We were in compliance with our debt covenants as of December 31, 2021.\nSenior Notes\nThe Senior Notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations and interest is payable semi-annually. The Senior Notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants as further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $300 million 15-year Senior Notes in a private placement. We will issue $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.81% (2.81% Senior Notes) in March 2022, which will mature in March 2037, and we will issue $150 million with a fixed interest rate of 2.91% (2.91% Senior Notes) in September 2022, which will mature in September 2037. We will use the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nIn May 2021, we entered into an agreement to issue and sell $125 million 12-year Senior Notes with a fixed interest rate of 2.83%. The Senior Notes were issued in July 2021 and will mature in July 2033.\n41\nWe used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 25, 2021, we entered into a $1.25 billion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended our $1.1 billion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit Agreement), which is further described in Note 10 to our consolidated financial statements.\nOther Local Arrangements\nIn April 2018, two of our non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $39.6 million (Swiss franc 38 million) to a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions, which include an interest rate of Swiss franc LIBOR plus 87.5 basis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nIn November 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized an additional $2.5 billion to the share repurchase program which has $2.1 billion of remaining availability as of December 31, 2021. The share repurchases are expected to be funded from cash generated from operating activities, borrowings, and cash balances. Repurchases will be made through open market transactions, and the amount and timing of purchases will depend on business and market conditions, the stock price, trading restrictions, the level of acquisition activity, and other factors.\nWe have purchased 30.2 million common shares since the inception of the program in 2004 through December 31, 2021, at a total cost of $6.9 billion. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we spent $1.0 billion and $775.0 million on the repurchase of 739,486 shares and 815,652 shares at an average price per share of $1,352.27 and $950.14, respectively. We reissued 110,748 shares and 162,176 shares held in treasury for the exercise of stock options and restricted stock units during 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEffect of Currency on Results of Operations\nOur earnings are affected by changing exchange rates. We are particularly sensitive to changes in the exchange rates between the Swiss franc, euro, Chinese renminbi, and U.S. dollar. We have more Swiss franc expenses than we do Swiss franc sales because we develop and manufacture products in Switzerland that we sell globally and have a number of corporate functions located in Switzerland. When the Swiss franc strengthens against our other trading currencies, particularly the U.S. dollar and euro, our earnings go down. We also have significantly more sales in the euro than we do expenses. When the euro weakens against the U.S. dollar and Swiss franc, our earnings also go down. We estimate a 1% strengthening of the Swiss franc against the euro would reduce our earnings before tax by approximately $1.9 million to $2.1 million annually.\nWe also conduct business throughout the world, including Asia Pacific, the United Kingdom, Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Canada. Fluctuations in these currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar can also affect our operating results. The most significant of these currency exposures is the Chinese renminbi. The impact on our earnings before tax of the Chinese renminbi weakening 1% against the U.S. dollar is a reduction of approximately $2.9 million to $3.1 million annually.\nIn addition to the effects of exchange rate movements on operating profits, our debt levels can fluctuate due to changes in exchange rates, particularly between the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc, and euro. Based on our outstanding debt at December 31, 2021, we estimate that a 5% weakening of the U.S. dollar\n42\nagainst the currencies in which our debt is denominated would result in an increase of $34.3 million in the reported U.S. dollar value of our debt.\nTaxes\nWe are subject to taxation in many jurisdictions throughout the world. Our effective tax rate and tax liability will be affected by a number of factors, such as changes in law, the amount of taxable income in particular jurisdictions, the tax rates in such jurisdictions, tax treaties between jurisdictions, the extent to which we transfer funds between jurisdictions, and earnings repatriations between jurisdictions. Generally, the tax liability for each taxpayer within the Mettler-Toledo International Inc. group of companies is determined either (i) on a non-consolidated/non-combined basis or (ii) on a consolidated/combined basis only with other eligible entities subject to tax in the same jurisdiction, in either case without regard to the taxable losses of non-consolidated/non-combined affiliated legal entities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe are subject to environmental laws and regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate. We own or lease a number of properties and manufacturing facilities around the world. Like many of our competitors, we have incurred, and will continue to incur, capital and operating expenditures and other costs in complying with such laws and regulations.\nWe are currently involved in, or have potential liability with respect to, the remediation of past contamination in certain of our facilities. A former subsidiary of Mettler-Toledo, LLC known as Hi-Speed Checkweigher Co., Inc. was one of two private parties ordered by the New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection, in an administrative consent order signed on June 13, 1988, to investigate and remediate certain ground water contamination at a property in Landing, New Jersey. After the other party under this order failed to fulfill its obligations, Hi-Speed became solely responsible for compliance with the order. Residual ground water contamination at this site is now within a Classification Exception Area which the Department of Environmental Protection has approved and within which the Company oversees monitoring of the decay of contaminants of concern. A concurrent Well Restriction Area also exists for the site. The Department of Environmental Protection does not view these vehicles as remedial measures, but rather as “institutional controls” that must be adequately maintained and periodically evaluated. We estimate that the costs of compliance associated with the site over the next several years will approximate a total of $0.4 million.\nIn addition, certain of our present and former facilities have or had been in operation for many decades and, over such time, some of these facilities may have used substances or generated and disposed of wastes which are or may be considered hazardous. It is possible that these sites, as well as disposal sites owned by third parties to which we have sent wastes, may in the future be identified and become the subject of remediation. Although we believe that we are in substantial compliance with applicable environmental requirements and, to date, we have not incurred material expenditures in connection with environmental matters, it is possible that we could become subject to additional environmental liabilities in the future that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nInflation\nInflation can affect the costs of goods and services that we use, including raw materials to manufacture our products, as well as transportation and logistical costs. The competitive environment in which we operate limits somewhat our ability to recover higher costs through increased selling prices. Global inflation significantly increased during 2021 related to the COVID-19 economic recovery and associated disruptions in global demand, logistics, and labor markets. These inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results in future years.\n43\nMoreover, there may be differences in inflation rates between countries in which we incur the major portion of our costs and other countries in which we sell products, which may limit our ability to recover increased costs. We remain committed to operations in China, Eastern Europe, India, and Brazil, which have experienced inflationary conditions. To date, these inflationary conditions have not had a material effect on our operating results. However, as our presence in China, Eastern Europe, India, and Brazil increases, these inflationary conditions could have a greater impact on our operating results.\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nWe have only limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and do not use them for trading purposes.\nWe have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements. These contracts are more fully described in Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements. The fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $0.4 million at December 31, 2021. Based on our agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021, a 100-basis-point change in interest rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments of approximately $0.2 million. Any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled.\nWe have entered into certain cross currency swap agreements. The fair value of these contracts was a net liability of $3.4 million at December 31, 2021. Based on our agreements outstanding at December 31, 2021, a 100-basis-point change in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates would result in a change in the net aggregate market value of these instruments by approximately $4.2 million. Any change in fair value would not affect our consolidated statement of operations unless such agreements and the debt they hedge were prematurely settled.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues, expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to revenue, income taxes, inventories, goodwill and intangibles, leases, and pensions and other post-retirement benefits. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nWe believe the following critical accounting estimates affect our more significant judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements. For a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies, see Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements.\n44\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense, deferred tax assets and liabilities, and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect management’s assessment of estimated future taxes to be paid on items in the consolidated financial statements. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized. The valuation allowance of $51.1 million as of December 31, 2021 is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income or equity in the period such determination was made. Likewise, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the valuation allowance in the future, an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made.\nWe plan to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and expect the additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such earnings will be non-U.S. withholding taxes, certain state taxes, and U.S. taxes on currency gains, if any. All other undistributed earnings are considered permanently reinvested.\nThe significant assumptions and estimates described in the preceding paragraphs are important contributors to our ultimate effective tax rate for each year in addition to our income mix from geographical regions. If any of our assumptions or estimates were to change, or should our income mix from our geographical regions change, our effective tax rate could be materially affected. Based on earnings before taxes of $949.4 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, each increase of $9.5 million in tax expense would increase our effective tax rate by 1%.\nEmployee benefit plans\nThe net periodic pension cost for 2021 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 were $0.6 million and $141.9 million, respectively, for our U.S. pension plan. The net periodic cost for 2021 and projected benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 were $9.1 million and $1.0 billion, respectively, for our international pension plans. The net periodic post-retirement benefit for 2021 and expected post-retirement benefit obligation as of December 31, 2021 for our U.S. post-retirement medical benefit plan were $0.1 million and $0.9 million, respectively.\nPension and post-retirement benefit plan expense and obligations are developed from assumptions utilized in actuarial valuations. The most significant of these assumptions include the discount rate and expected return on plan assets. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and deferred over future periods. While management believes the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our plan obligations and future expense.\nThe expected rates of return on the various defined benefit pension plans’ assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long-term projected return of those assets, which represent a diversified mix of U.S. and international corporate equities and government and corporate debt securities. In 2002, we froze our U.S. defined benefit pension plan and discontinued our retiree medical program for certain current and all future employees. Consequently, no significant future service costs will be incurred on these plans. For 2021, the weighted average return on assets assumption was 5.75% for the U.S. plan and 3.78% for the international plans. A change in the rate of return of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $9.0 million after tax.\nThe discount rates for defined benefit and post-retirement plans are set by benchmarking against high-quality corporate bonds. For 2021, the weighted average discount rate assumption was 2.6% for the U.S. plan and 0.4% for the international plans, representing a weighted average of local rates in countries\n45\nwhere such plans exist. A change in the discount rate of 1% would impact annual benefit plan expense by approximately $11.7 million after tax.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, our consolidated balance sheet included goodwill of $648.6 million and other intangible assets of $307.5 million.\nOur business acquisitions typically result in goodwill and other intangible assets, which affect the amount of future period amortization expense and possible impairment expense. The determination of the value of such intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are evaluated for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.\nIf we are unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during our qualitative assessment, we perform a quantitative impairment test by estimating the fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount of the goodwill asset. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recognized.\nBoth the qualitative and quantitative evaluations consider operating results, business plans, economic conditions, and market data, among other factors. There are inherent uncertainties related to these factors and our judgment in applying them to the impairment analyses. Our assessments to date have indicated that there has been no impairment of these assets.\nShould any of these estimates or assumptions change, or should we incur lower than expected operating performance or cash flows, including from a prolonged economic slowdown, we may experience a triggering event that requires a new fair value assessment for our reporting units, possibly prior to the required annual assessment. These types of events and resulting analysis could result in impairment charges for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets if the fair value estimate declines below the carrying value.\nOur amortization expense related to intangible assets with finite lives may materially change should our estimates of their useful lives change.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements."

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have concluded that these disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. In making this assessment, we used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013). Based on our assessment, we concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm that audited the financial statements included in this Report on Form 10-K, has issued their integrated audit report, which covers our internal control over financial reporting, which appears on page F-2.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable\nF-2\nassurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated\nfinancial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets\nAs described in Notes 2 and 14 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded deferred tax assets of\n$205.6 million, net of a valuation allowance of $51.1 million, as\nof December 31, 2021.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of deferred tax assets is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, particularly as it relates to estimates of future taxable income and application of income tax law in relevant foreign jurisdictions; (ii) the high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence related to management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets as it relates to estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the valuation of deferred tax assets, including controls over estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating management’s assessment of the realizability of deferred tax assets on a jurisdictional basis; (ii) evaluating management's estimates of future taxable income; (iii) evaluating management's application of relevant income tax law; and (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used in management’s assessment.\nF-3\nEvaluating management’s estimates of future taxable income involved evaluating whether the estimates were reasonable considering (i) the current and past performance of the respective entity and (ii) whether the estimates were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the application of relevant income tax law.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nColumbus, Ohio\nFebruary 11, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2005.\nF-4\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nFor the years ended December 31\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nFor the years ended December 31\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nAs of December 31\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nFor the years ended December 31\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-8\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nFor the years ended December 31\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\nF-9\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\n1.\nBUSINESS DESCRIPTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nMettler-Toledo International Inc. (Mettler-Toledo or the Company) is a leading global supplier of precision instruments and services. The Company manufactures weighing instruments for use in laboratory, industrial, packaging, logistics, and food retailing applications. The Company also manufactures several related analytical instruments and provides automated chemistry solutions used in drug and chemical compound discovery and development. In addition, the Company manufactures metal detection and other end-of-line inspection systems used in production and packaging and provides solutions for use in certain process analytics applications. The Company’s primary manufacturing facilities are located in China, Switzerland, the United States, Germany, the United Kingdom, and Mexico. The Company’s principal executive offices are located in Columbus, Ohio and Greifensee, Switzerland.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (U.S. GAAP) and include all entities in which the Company has control, which are its wholly owned subsidiaries.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results may differ from those estimates due to uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as other factors. A discussion of the Company's significant accounting policies is included in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included within this filing.\nAll intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\n2.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include highly liquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less. The carrying value of these cash equivalents approximates fair value.\nTrade Accounts Receivable\nTrade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. The allowance for expected credit losses represents the Company’s best estimate based on current and historical information and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future events and circumstances.\nInventories\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes direct materials, labor, and overhead, is generally determined using the first in, first out (FIFO) method. The estimated net realizable value is based on assumptions for future demand and related pricing. Adjustments to the cost basis of the Company’s inventory are made for excess and obsolete items based on usage, expected future orders, and technological obsolescence. If actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management, reductions in the value of inventory may be required.\nF-10\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nLong-Lived Assets\na)\nProperty, Plant, and Equipment\nProperty, plant, and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Repair and maintenance costs are charged to expense as incurred. The Company capitalizes certain direct costs related to the acquisition and development of internal-use computer software. Externally purchased software is capitalized when we obtain legal ownership and is amortized over its useful life ranging from three to five years. Internally developed software costs for internal use are capitalized once the preliminary project stage is complete and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used to perform the function intended. Costs associated with internal-use software are amortized on a straight-line basis over\n10\nyears. Fully depreciated assets other than capitalized internally developed software are retained in property, plant, and equipment and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal.\nDepreciation and amortization are charged on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nIn September 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with the U.S. Department of Defense to increase domestic production capacity of pipette tips and enhance manufacturing automation and logistics. The Company will receive funding of $35.8 million over the next two years, which will offset future capital expenditures. In accordance with ASU 2021-10: Government Assistance, the Company will apply guidance within IAS 20 - Accounting for Government Grants and Disclosure and will account for the government agreement by reducing the cost of the asset within property, plant, and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets by the amount of the funds received.\nb)\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nGoodwill, representing the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of companies acquired, and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized, but are reviewed for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an asset might be impaired. The annual evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are generally based on an assessment of qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the asset is less than its carrying amount.\nIf the Company is unable to conclude whether the goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset is not impaired after considering the totality of events and circumstances during its qualitative assessment, the Company performs a quantitative assessment by estimating the fair value of the respective reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset and comparing the fair value to the carrying amount. If the carrying amount of the reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge equal to the difference is recognized.\nOther intangible assets include indefinite-lived assets and assets subject to amortization. Where applicable, amortization is charged on a straight-line basis over the expected period to be benefited. The straight-line method of amortization reflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting\nF-11\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nperiod. The Company assesses the initial acquisition of intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 805 - Business Combinations and the continued accounting for previously recognized intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 - Intangible - Goodwill and Other and ASC 360 - Property, Plant, and Equipment.\nAccounting for Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company assesses the need to record impairment losses on long-lived assets (asset group) with finite lives when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. An impairment loss would be recognized when future estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from use and eventually disposition of that asset (asset group) are less than the asset’s carrying value, with the loss measured as the difference between carrying value and estimated fair value.\nTaxation\nThe Company files tax returns in each jurisdiction in which it operates. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities, their respective tax bases, and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in the respective jurisdictions in which the Company operates. In assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. The valuation allowance is based on management’s estimates of future taxable income and application of relevant income tax law.\nDeferred taxes are not provided on the unremitted earnings of subsidiaries outside of the United States when it is expected that these earnings are permanently reinvested. Such earnings may become taxable upon the sale or liquidation of these subsidiaries or upon the remittance of dividends. Deferred taxes are provided when the Company no longer considers subsidiary earnings to be permanently invested, such as in situations where the Company’s subsidiaries plan to make future dividend distributions.\nIn accordance with the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, the Company treats taxes due on future Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (GILTI) inclusions in U.S. taxable income as a current period expense when incurred.\nThe Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions as part of income tax expense within its consolidated statement of operations.\nCurrency Translation and Transactions\nThe reporting currency for the consolidated financial statements of the Company is the U.S. dollar. The functional currency for the Company’s operations is generally the applicable local currency. Accordingly, the assets and liabilities of companies whose functional currency is other than the U.S. dollar are included in the consolidated financial statements by translating the assets and liabilities into the reporting currency at the exchange rates applicable at the end of the reporting period. The statements of operations and cash flows of such non-U.S. dollar functional currency operations are translated at the monthly weighted average exchange rates during the year. Translation gains or losses are accumulated in other comprehensive income (loss) in the consolidated statements of shareholders’ equity. Transaction gains and losses are included as a component of net earnings or in certain circumstances as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) where the underlying item is considered a hedge of a net investment or relates to intercompany notes that are long term in nature.\nF-12\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nRevenue Recognition\nProduct revenue is recognized from contracts with customers when a customer has obtained control of a product. The Company considers control to have transferred based upon shipping terms. To the extent the Company’s contracts have a separate performance obligation, revenue related to any post-shipment performance obligation is deferred until completed. Shipping and handling costs charged to customers are included in total net sales and the associated expense is a component of cost of sales. Certain products are also sold through indirect distribution channels whereby the distributor assumes any further obligations to the end-customer. Revenue is recognized on these distributor arrangements upon transfer of control to the distributor. Contracts do not contain variable pricing arrangements that are retrospective, except for rebate programs. Rebates are estimated based on expected sales volumes and offset against revenue at the time such revenue is recognized. The Company generally maintains the right to accept or reject a product return in its terms and conditions and also maintains appropriate accruals for outstanding credits. The related provisions for estimated returns and rebates are immaterial to the consolidated financial statements.\nCertain of the Company’s product arrangements include separate performance obligations, primarily related to installation. Such performance obligations are accounted for separately when the deliverables have stand-alone value and the satisfaction of the undelivered performance obligations is probable and within the Company’s control. The allocation of revenue between the performance obligations is based on the observable stand-alone selling prices at the time of the sale in accordance with a number of factors including service technician billing rates, time to install, and geographic location.\nSoftware is generally not considered a distinct performance obligation with the exception of a limited number of small software applications. The Company generally sells software products with the related hardware instrument as the software is embedded in the product. The Company’s products typically require no significant production, modification, or customization of the hardware or software that is essential to the functionality of the products.\nService revenue not under contract is recognized upon the completion of the service performed. Revenue from spare parts sold on a stand-alone basis is recognized when control is transferred to the customer, which is generally at the time of shipment or delivery. Revenue from service contracts is recognized ratably over the contract period using a time-based method. These contracts represent an obligation to perform repair and other services including regulatory compliance qualification, calibration, certification, and preventative maintenance on a customer’s pre-defined equipment over the contract period.\nLeases\nThe Company considers an arrangement a lease if the arrangement transfers the right to control the use of an identified asset in exchange for consideration. The Company has operating leases, but does not have material financing leases.\nOperating lease right-of-use assets represent the right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the obligation to make payments arising from the lease agreement. These assets and liabilities are recognized at the commencement of the lease based upon the present value of the lease payments over the lease term. Lease payments include both lease and non-lease components for items or activities that transfer a good and service. Vehicle lease and non-lease components are separately accounted for based on stand-alone value. Real estate lease and non-lease components are accounted for as\nF-13\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\na single component. Operating lease right-of-use assets include initial direct costs, advanced lease payments, and lease incentives.\nThe lease term reflects the noncancellable period of the lease together with periods covered by an option to extend or terminate the lease when management is reasonably certain that it will exercise such option. The Company applies its incremental borrowing rate at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments as the information necessary to determine the rate implicit in the lease is not readily available. The incremental borrowing rate reflects similar terms by geographic location to the underlying leases. The Company’s lease agreements do not contain any material residual value guarantees or material restrictive covenants.\nLease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Variable lease payments consist of non-lease services related to the lease. Variable lease payments are excluded from the right-of-use asset and lease liabilities and are expensed as incurred. Short-term leases are less than one year without purchase or renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised and are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is tested for impairment in accordance with ASC 360.\nResearch and Development\nResearch and development costs primarily consist of salaries, consulting, and other costs. The Company expenses these costs as incurred.\nEmployee Termination Benefits\nIn situations where contractual termination benefits exist, the Company records accruals for employee termination benefits when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability is reasonably estimable. All other employee termination arrangements are recognized and measured at their fair value at the communication date unless the employee is required to render additional service beyond the legal notification period, in which case the liability is recognized ratably over the future service period.\nEarnings per Common Share\nIn accordance with the treasury stock method, the Company has included\n327,768\n,\n316,582\n, and\n406,848\ncommon equivalent shares in the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common shares for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, relating to outstanding stock options and restricted stock units.\nOutstanding options and restricted stock units to purchase or receive\n24,036\n,\n36,263\n, and\n71,660\nshares of common stock for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, have been excluded from the calculation of diluted weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares as such options and restricted stock units would be anti-dilutive.\nEquity-Based Compensation\nThe Company applies the fair value methodology in accounting for its equity-based compensation plan.\nF-14\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. As described more fully in Note 6, the Company primarily enters into foreign currency forward exchange contracts to economically hedge certain short-term intercompany balances involving its international businesses. Such contracts limit the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the underlying hedged item. These contracts are adjusted to fair market value as of each balance sheet date, with the resulting changes in fair value being recognized in other charges (income), consistent with the underlying hedged item.\nThe Company also enters into interest rate swap agreements and cross currency swaps in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. The differential paid or received on interest rate swap agreements is recognized as incurred in interest expense over the life of the hedge agreements. Floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements are accounted for as cash flow hedges. Changes in fair value of outstanding interest rate swap agreements that are effective as cash flow hedges are initially recognized in other comprehensive income as incurred.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe Company measures or monitors certain assets and liabilities on a fair value basis. Fair value is used on a recurring basis for assets and liabilities in which fair value is the primary basis of accounting, mainly derivative instruments. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required to be recorded at fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. The Company applies the fair value hierarchy established under U.S. GAAP and when possible looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets and liabilities. If identical assets and liabilities are not traded in active markets, the Company looks to observable market data for similar assets and liabilities.\nBusiness Combinations and Asset Acquisitions\nThe Company accounts for business acquisitions under the accounting standards for business combinations. The results of each acquisition are included in the Company’s consolidated results as of the acquisition date. The purchase price of an acquisition is allocated to tangible and intangible assets and assumed liabilities based on their estimated fair values and any consideration in excess of the net assets acquired is recognized as goodwill. Acquisition transaction costs are expensed when incurred.\nIn circumstances where an acquisition involves a contingent consideration arrangement, the Company recognizes a liability equal to the fair value of the expected contingent payments as of the acquisition date. Subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration are recorded to other charges (income), net.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nIn March 2020 and January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04 and ASU 2021-01: Reference Rate Reform, which provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuance of LIBOR or another referenced rate. The guidance may be applied to any applicable contract entered into before December 31, 2022. The Company's interest rate and cross currency swaps, as mentioned in Note 6 to the consolidated financial\nF-15\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nstatements, are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA) agreements, and the Company will adhere to the ISDA's fallback protocol when LIBOR is discontinued. In addition, the Company renewed the LIBOR-based credit agreement, as discussed further in Note 10, which includes a fallback protocol when LIBOR is discontinued. Based on these procedures, when LIBOR is discontinued, the interest rate and cross currency swaps will not require de-designation if certain criteria are met. The Company expects the financial impact of the rate change when LIBOR is discontinued to be immaterial to its financial statements.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10: Government Assistance, which increases the transparency of government assistance including the disclosure of the types of assistance, an entity's accounting for the assistance, and the effect of the assistance on an entity's financial statements. The Company early adopted this guidance on a prospective basis in the fourth quarter of 2021. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the Company's disclosures.\n3.\nREVENUE\nThe Company disaggregates revenue from contracts with customers by product, service, timing of revenue recognition, and geography.\nA summary by the Company’s reportable segments follows for the years ended December 31:\nF-16\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe Company's global revenue mix by product category for the year ended December 31, 2021 is laboratory (\n56\n% of sales), industrial (\n39\n% of sales), and retail (\n5\n% of sales). The Company’s product revenue by reportable segment is proportionately similar to the Company’s global mix with the exception of the Company’s Swiss Operations, which is largely comprised of laboratory products, and the Company’s Chinese Operations, which has a slightly higher percentage of industrial products. A breakdown of the Company’s sales by product category for the year ended December 31 follows:\nA breakdown of net sales to external customers by geographic customer destination, net for the year ended December 31 follows:\nThe payment terms in the Company’s contracts with customers do not exceed one year and therefore contracts do not contain a significant financing component. In most cases, after appropriate credit evaluations, payments are due in arrears and are recognized as receivables. Unbilled revenue is recorded when performance obligations have been satisfied, but not yet billed to the customer. Unbilled revenue as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n32.1\nmillion and $\n22.6\nmillion, respectively, and is included within accounts receivable. Deferred revenue and customer prepayments are recorded when cash payments are received or due in advance of the performance obligation being satisfied. Deferred revenue primarily includes prepaid service contracts, as well as deferred installation.\nChanges in the components of deferred revenue and customer prepayments during the period are as follows:\nThe Company generally expenses sales commissions when incurred because the contract period is one year or less. These costs are recorded within selling, general, and administrative expenses. The Company has not disclosed the value of unsatisfied performance obligations other than customer prepayments and deferred revenue as most contracts have an expected length of one year or less and amounts greater than one year are immaterial.\nF-17\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\n4.\nACQUISITIONS\nIn March 2021, the Company acquired all the membership interests of Mayfair Technology, LLC (PendoTECH), a manufacturer and distributor of single-use sensors, transmitters, control systems, and software for measuring, monitoring, and data collection primarily in bioprocess applications. PendoTECH serves biopharmaceutical manufacturers and life science laboratories and is located in the United States. The initial cash payment was $\n185.0\nmillion and the Company made other post-closing payments of $\n7.4\nmillion. The Company may be required to pay additional consideration of up to $\n20.0\nmillion, which is based upon financial thresholds in 2022 and 2023. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation at the time of acquisition of $\n13.5\nmillion was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the Company's forecast of future financial results. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company increased the contingent consideration obligation to $\n20.0\nmillion, based upon actual results and future financial projections, plus related obligations of $\n0.3\nmillion due to the sellers. The $\n6.8\nmillion increase to the contingent consideration and related obligations to the sellers was recorded in other charges (income), net.\nGoodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled $\n93.1\nmillion, which is deductible for tax purposes. Identified intangible finite-lived assets acquired include customer relationships of $\n78.6\nmillion, technology and patents of $\n21.7\nmillion, trade name of $\n3.4\nmillion, and other intangibles of $\n2.4\nmillion. The Company used variations of the income statement approach in determining the fair value of the intangible assets acquired. Specifically, the multi-period excess earnings method was used to determine the fair value of the customer relationships acquired and the relief from royalty method was used to determine the fair value of the technology and patents. The Company's determination of the fair value of the intangible assets acquired involved the use of significant estimates and assumptions principally related to revenue growth, royalty, and customer attrition rates.\nThe identifiable finite-lived intangible assets will be amortized on a straight-line basis over periods of\n5\nto\n20\nyears and the annual aggregate amortization expense is estimated at $\n6.9\nmillion. Net tangible assets acquired were $\n7.4\nmillion and were recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements. All of the acquired assets are included in the Company's U.S. Operations segment.\nIn October 2021, the Company acquired Scale-up Systems Inc., a leading software provider for scale-up and reaction modeling serving the biopharma and chemical markets. The initial cash payment was $\n20.2\nmillion and the Company may be required to pay additional amounts up to EUR\n3.0\nmillion. Goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition totaled $\n11.1\nmillion, which is deductible for tax purposes. The Company also recorded $\n11.4\nmillion of identifiable finite-lived intangibles primarily pertaining to technology and patents and customer relationships in connection with this acquisition, which will be amortized on a straight-line basis over\n7\nto\n10\nyears. All of the acquired assets are included in the Company's Western European Operations segment.\nIn 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company also incurred additional acquisition payments totaling $\n8.3\nmillion, $\n6.2\nmillion, and $\n2.0\nmillion, respectively.\nF-18\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\n5.\nINVENTORIES\nInventories consisted of the following at December 31:\n6.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and does not use them for trading purposes. The Company enters into certain interest rate and cross currency swap agreements in order to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates. At December 31, 2021, the interest payments associated with\n79\n% of the Company’s debt are fixed obligations. The amount of the Company’s fixed obligation interest payments may change based upon the expiration dates of its interest rate and cross currency swap agreement and the level and composition of its debt. The Company also enters into certain foreign currency forward contracts to limit the Company’s exposure to currency fluctuations on the respective hedged items. For additional disclosures on derivative instruments regarding balance sheet location, fair value, and the amounts reclassified into other comprehensive income and the effective portion of the cash flow hedges, also see Note 7 and Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements. As also mentioned in Note 10, the Company has designated its euro-denominated debt as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in a euro-denominated foreign subsidiary.\nCash Flow Hedges\nIn November 2021, the Company entered into a cross currency swap arrangement designated as a cash flow hedge. The agreement converts $\n50\nmillion of borrowings under the Company's credit facility into synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income of\n0.64\n%. The swap matures in November 2023.\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into a cross currency swap arrangement designated as a cash flow hedge. The agreement converts $\n50\nmillion of borrowings under the Company's credit facility into  synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income of\n0.57\n%. The swap matures in June 2025. This cross currency swap replaced a similar $\n50\nmillion swap entered into in June 2019 which matured in June 2021, which converted floating rate LIBOR to a fixed Swiss franc income of\n0.95\n%.\nIn June 2021, the Company entered into a cross currency swap arrangement designated as a cash flow hedge. The agreement converts $\n50\nmillion of borrowings under the Company's credit facility into  synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income of\n0.66\n%. The swap matures in June 2024. This cross currency swap replaced a similar $\n50\nmillion swap entered into in February 2019 and maturing in June 2021, which converted floating rate LIBOR to a fixed Swiss franc income of\n0.78\n%.\nF-19\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nIn June 2019, the Company entered into a cross currency swap arrangement designated as a cash flow hedge. The agreement converts $\n50\nmillion of borrowings under the Company's credit facility into synthetic Swiss franc debt, which allows the Company to effectively change the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payment, excluding the credit spread, to a fixed Swiss franc income of\n0.82\n%. The swap matures in June 2023.\nIn 2015, the Company entered into a forward-starting interest rate swap agreement. The agreement changes the floating rate LIBOR-based interest payments associated with $\n100\nmillion in borrowings under the Company’s credit agreement to a fixed obligation of\n2.25\n%, which began in February 2017 and matures in February 2022.\nThe Company’s cash flow hedges are recorded gross at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and are disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. A derivative gain of $\n1.6\nmillion based upon interest rates at December 31, 2021 is expected to be reclassified from other comprehensive income (loss) to earnings in the next 12 months. Through December 31, 2021, no hedge ineffectiveness has occurred in relation to these cash flow hedges.\nOther Derivatives\nThe Company primarily enters into foreign currency forward contracts in order to economically hedge short-term intercompany balances largely denominated in Swiss franc, other major European currencies, and the Chinese renminbi with its foreign businesses. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, these contracts are considered “derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.” Gains or losses on these instruments are reported in current earnings. The foreign currency forward contracts are recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as disclosed in Note 7 to the consolidated financial statements. The Company recognized in other charges (income) net gains of $\n13.5\nmillion and $\n4.8\nmillion and a net loss of $\n3.7\nmillion during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, which offset the related net transaction gains (losses) associated with these contracts. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, these contracts had a notional value of $\n1.0\nbillion and  $\n536.5\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company may be exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to its derivative financial instrument contracts. Counterparties are established banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings. The Company believes that such counterparties will be able to fully satisfy their obligations under these contracts.\n7.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had derivative assets totaling $\n6.0\nmillion and $\n2.2\nmillion, respectively, and derivative liabilities totaling $\n10.3\nmillion and $\n23.3\nmillion, respectively. The Company has limited involvement with derivative financial instruments and therefore does not present all the required disclosures in tabular format. The fair values of the interest rate swap agreements, the cross currency swap agreements, and the foreign currency forward contracts that economically hedge short-term intercompany balances are estimated based upon inputs from current valuation information obtained from dealer quotes and priced with observable market assumptions and appropriate valuation adjustments for credit risk. The Company has evaluated the valuation methodologies used to develop the fair values by dealers in order to determine whether such valuations are representative of an exit price in the Company’s principal market. In addition, the Company uses an internally developed model to perform testing on the valuations received from brokers. The Company has also considered both its own credit risk\nF-20\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nand counterparty credit risk in determining fair value and determined these adjustments were insignificant for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nUnder U.S. GAAP, fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. A fair value measurement consists of observable and unobservable inputs that reflect the assumptions that a market participant would use in pricing an asset or liability.\nA fair value hierarchy has been established that categorizes these inputs into three levels:\nLevel 1: Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\nLevel 2: Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs\nThe following table presents the Company’s assets and liabilities, which are all categorized as Level 2 and are measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The Company does not have any assets or liabilities which are categorized as Level 1.\nThe Company had $\n18.5\nmillion and $\n14.3\nmillion of cash equivalents at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, the fair value of which is determined using Level 2 inputs through quoted and corroborated prices in active markets. The fair value of cash equivalents approximates cost.\nThe fair value of the Company’s debt exceeds the carrying value by approximately $\n32.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of the Company’s fixed interest rate debt was estimated using Level 2 inputs and primarily discounted cash flow models, based on estimated current rates offered for similar debt under current market conditions for the Company.\nThe initial estimated fair value of the contingent consideration obligation of $\n13.5\nmillion relating to the PendoTECH acquisition was determined using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the Company's forecast of future financial results. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company increased the contingent consideration obligation to $\n20.0\nmillion based upon actual results and future financial\nF-21\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nprojections. The fair value measurements are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent a Level 3 measurement.\n8.\nPROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nProperty, plant, and equipment, net consisted of the following at December 31:\n9.\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table shows the changes in the carrying amount of goodwill for the years ended December 31:\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived assets are reviewed for impairment on an annual basis in the fourth quarter. The Company completed its impairment review and determined that there had been no impairment of these assets through December 31, 2021. The Company identified no triggering events or other circumstances which indicated the carrying amount of goodwill or intangible assets may not be recoverable.\nThe components of other intangible assets as of December 31 are as follows:\nThe Company recognized amortization expense associated with the above intangible assets of $\n22.5\nmillion, $\n15.7\nmillion, and $\n15.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The annual aggregate amortization expense based on the current balance of other intangible assets is estimated at $\n26.1\nmillion for 2022, $\n24.8\nmillion for 2023, $\n22.7\nmillion for 2024, $\n21.8\nmillion for 2025, and $\n19.6\nmillion for 2026. The finite-lived intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from\n3\nto\n45\nyears. The straight-line method of amortization\nF-22\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nreflects an appropriate allocation of the cost of the intangible assets to earnings in proportion to the amount of economic benefits obtained by the Company in each reporting period. Purchased intangibles amortization was $\n21.6\nmillion, $\n16.3\nmillion after tax, $\n14.9\nmillion, $\n11.2\nmillion after tax, and $\n14.3\nmillion, $\n10.8\nmillion after tax, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition to the above amortization, the Company recorded amortization expense associated with capitalized software, which is included in property, plant, and equipment in Note 8, of $\n40.4\nmillion, $\n40.7\nmillion, and $\n34.4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\n10\n.\nDEBT\nDebt consisted of the following at December 31:\n(1) See Note 6 and Note 7 for additional disclosures on the financial instruments associated with the Credit Agreement.\nThe Company’s weighted average interest rate was\n2.7\n% and\n2.9\n% for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSenior Notes\nThe Senior Notes listed above are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and interest is payable semi-annually. The Company may at any time prepay the Senior Notes, in whole or in part, at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interests, and in some instances a “make whole” prepayment premium. The Euro Senior Notes, if prepaid, may also include a swap related currency loss. The Senior Notes each contain customary affirmative and negative covenants including, among others, limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to incurrence of liens and priority indebtedness, disposition of assets, mergers, and transactions with affiliates. In December 2021, the Company amended all of its U.S. Senior Note agreements to conform to the financial\nF-23\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\ncovenants in the underlying agreements.\nThe amended agreements require the Company to maintain a consolidated interest coverage ratio of not less than 3.0 to 1.0 and a net consolidated leverage ratio of not more than 3.5 to 1.0.\nThe Senior Notes also contain customary events of default with customary grace periods, as applicable.\nThe Company was in compliance with its covenants at December 31, 2021.\nTotal issuance costs of approximately $\n4.1\nmillion have been incurred by the Company related to the Senior Notes mentioned above and are being amortized to interest expense over the various terms.\nIn December 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to issue and sell $300 million 15-year Senior Notes in a private placement. The Company will issue $\n150\nmillion with a fixed interest rate of\n2.81\n% (\n2.81\n% Senior Notes) in March 2022 and will issue $\n150\nmillion with a fixed interest rate of\n2.91\n% (\n2.91\n% Senior Notes) in September 2022. The Senior Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company. The\n2.81\n% Senior Notes mature in March 2037 and the\n2.91\n% Senior Notes mature in September 2037. Interest on the\n2.81\n% and\n2.91\n% Senior Notes will be payable semi-annually in March and September each year. Interest on the\n2.81\n% Senior Notes will begin in September 2022 and interest on the\n2.91\n% will begin in March 2023. The terms of the Senior Notes are consistent with the previous Senior Notes as described above. The Company will use the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nIn May 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to issue and sell $\n125\nmillion 12-year Senior Notes with a fixed interest rate of\n2.83\n%. The Senior Notes were issued in July 2021 and will mature in July 2033. The terms of the Senior Notes are consistent with the previous Senior Notes as described above. The Company used the proceeds from the sale of the notes to refinance existing indebtedness and for other general corporate purposes.\nIn December 2020, the Company entered into an agreement to issue and sell EUR\n125.0\nmillion 15-year\n1.06\n% Euro Senior Notes (\n1.06\n% Euro Senior Notes). The terms of the Euro Senior Notes are consistent with the previous Euro Senior Notes as described above. The Company also entered into a forward contract to receive $\n152.1\nmillion at the time of issuing the\n1.06\n% Euro Senior Notes in March 2021. The proceeds will be used to repay outstanding amounts on the Company’s credit facility and fund operational expenses. The\n1.06\n% Euro Senior Notes will be designated as a hedge of a portion of the Company’s net investment in a euro-denominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency risk associated with this net investment.\nThe Company has designated the EUR\n125\nmillion\n1.47\n% Euro Senior Notes, the EUR\n135\nmillion\n1.30\n% Euro Senior Notes, and the EUR\n125\nmillion\n1.06\n% Euro Senior Notes as a hedge of a portion of its net investment in a euro-denominated foreign subsidiary to reduce foreign currency risk associated with this net investment. Changes in the carrying value of this debt resulting from fluctuations in the euro to U.S. dollar exchange rate are recorded as foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income (loss). The Company recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) related to this net investment hedge an unrealized gain of $\n34.3\nmillion, an unrealized loss of $\n27.3\nmillion, and an unrealized gain of $\n1.3\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company has a gain of $\n5.5\nmillion recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of December 31, 2021.\nCredit Agreement\nOn June 25, 2021, the Company entered into a $\n1.25\nbillion Credit Agreement (the Credit Agreement), which amended its $\n1.1\nbillion Amended and Restated Credit Agreement (the Prior Credit\nF-24\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nAgreement). As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n649.0\nmillion of additional borrowings available under its Credit Agreement.\nThe Credit Agreement is provided by a group of financial institutions (similar to the Company's Prior Credit Agreement) and has a maturity date of June 25, 2026. It is a revolving credit facility and is not subject to any scheduled principal payments prior to maturity. The obligations under the Credit Agreement are unsecured.\nBorrowings under the Credit Agreement bear interest at current market rates plus a margin based on the Company’s consolidated leverage ratio. The Company must also pay facility fees that are tied to its leverage ratio. The Credit Agreement contains covenants that are similar to those contained in the Prior Credit Agreement, with which the Company was in compliance as of December 31, 2021. The Company is required to maintain (i) a ratio of net funded indebtedness to EBITDA of 3.5 to 1.0 or less except in certain circumstances and (ii) an interest coverage ratio of 3.0 to 1.0 or greater. The Credit Agreement also places certain limitations on the Company, including limiting the ability to incur liens or indebtedness at a subsidiary level. In addition, the Credit Agreement has several events of default, with customary grace periods as applicable. The Company incurred approximately $\n0.2\nmillion of debt extinguishment costs during 2021 related to the Prior Credit Agreement. The Company capitalized $2.0 million in financing fees during 2021 associated with the Credit Agreement, which will be amortized to interest expense through 2026.\nOther Local Arrangements\nIn April 2018, two of the Company’s non-U.S. pension plans issued loans totaling $\n39.6\nmillion (Swiss franc\n38\nmillion) to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. The loans have the same terms and conditions, which include an interest rate of Swiss franc LIBOR plus\n87.5\nbasis points. The loans were renewed for one year in April 2021.\n11.\nSHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nThe number of authorized shares of the Company’s common stock is\n125,000,000\nshares with a par value of $\n0.01\nper share.

The Company’s 2013 Equity Incentive Plan was approved by shareholders on May 2, 2013 and provides that\n2\nmillion shares of common stock, plus any shares that remained available for grant under the Company’s prior equity incentive plan as well as options outstanding that terminate without being exercised, may be the subject of awards. The plan provides for the grant of options, restricted stock units, and other equity-based awards. The exercise price of options granted shall not be less than the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the award. Options primarily vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant and have a maximum term of up to 10 years. Restricted units primarily vest equally over a five-year period from the date of grant. Performance share units generally vest after a three-year period from the date of the grant based upon satisfaction of the performance condition. The compensation committee of the Board of Directors has generally granted restricted share units to participating managers and non-qualified stock options and performance share units to executive officers.\nOn May 6, 2021, the Company's shareholders approved the adoption of the Company's 2013 Equity Incentive Plan (Amended and Restated), with the effect that approximately 0.9 million additional shares of common stock were added to the 2.1 million shares that remained available under the plan prior to its amendment. In addition, shares subject to options granted under the Company's prior equity incentive plan that terminate or are forfeited without being exercised are also available for awards under the amended plan. The amended plan expires in 2031.\nF-28\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nAll share-based compensation arrangements granted to employees, including stock option grants, are recognized in the consolidated statement of operations based on the grant-date fair value of the award over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award. Share-based compensation expense is recorded within selling, general, and administrative in the consolidated statement of operations with a corresponding offset to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe fair values of stock options granted were calculated using the Black-Scholes pricing model. The aggregate intrinsic value of an option is the amount by which the fair value of the underlying stock exceeds its exercise price. The following table summarizes all stock option activity from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2021:\nThe following table details the weighted average remaining contractual life of options outstanding at December 31, 2021 by range of exercise prices:\nAs of the date granted, the weighted average grant-date fair value of the options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n377.89\n, $\n284.25\n, and $\n196.40\n, respectively.\nSuch weighted average grant-date fair value was determined using the following assumptions:\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was approximately $\n116.0\nmillion, $\n84.5\nmillion, and $\n146.6\nmillion, respectively.\nThe compensation expense for options recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n7.8\nmillion, $\n7.7\nmillion, and $\n8.0\nmillion, respectively.\nF-29\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe following table summarizes all restricted stock unit and performance share unit activity from December 31, 2020 through December 31, 2021:\n(1) 2017 performance share units vested in the first quarter 2021.\nThe weighted average grant-date fair value of the restricted stock units granted during the years ended 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n1,445.37\n, $\n1,104.02\n, and $\n720.81\nper unit, respectively, which primarily vest ratably over a five-year period. The total fair value of the restricted stock units on the date of grant was $\n11.4\nmillion for 2021, $\n9.1\nmillion for 2020, and $\n8.9\nmillion for 2019 and will be recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was approximately $\n11.4\nmillion, $\n7.7\nmillion, and $\n7.0\nmillion, respectively. Approximately $\n7.6\nmillion, $\n7.9\nmillion, and $\n7.1\nmillion of compensation expense was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company granted performance share units with a market condition during 2021, 2020, and 2019. Grantees of performance share units will be eligible to receive shares of the Company’s common stock depending upon the Company’s total shareholder return relative to the performance of companies in the S&P 500 Health Care and S&P 500 Industrials over a three-year period. The awards actually earned will range from zero to 200% of the targeted number of performance share units for the three-year performance period and will be paid, to the extent earned, in the fiscal quarter following the end of the applicable three-year performance period. During 2021, the market conditions for the 2018 performance share units were met and will vest in the first quarter 2022 with a payout of\n200\n%. Performance share unit awards were valued using a Monte Carlo simulation based on the following assumptions:\nAs of the date granted, the fair value of the performance share units granted was $\n1,447.75\nfor 2021, $\n1,345.03\nfor 2020, and $\n803.26\nfor 2019. The total fair value of the performance share units on the date of the grant was $\n4.0\nmillion for 2021 and $3.6 million for both 2020 and 2019, and will be recorded as compensation expense on a straight-line basis over the three-year performance period.\nThe compensation expense for performance share units recognized during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n4.2\nmillion, $\n3.1\nmillion, and $\n3.2\nmillion, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021, a total of\n3,858,825\nshares of common stock were available for grant in the form of stock options, restricted stock units, or performance share units.\nF-30\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nAs of December 31, 2021, the unrecorded deferred share-based compensation balance related to stock options, restricted stock units, and performance share units was $\n52.5\nmillion and will be recognized using a straight-line method over an estimated weighted average amortization period of\n2.3\nyears.\n13.\nBENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company maintains a number of retirement and other post-retirement employee benefit plans.\nCertain subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans. Benefits are determined and funded annually based upon the terms of the plans. Amounts recognized as cost under these plans amounted to $\n24.8\nmillion, $\n19.3\nmillion, and $\n18.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nCertain subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit plans. Benefits are provided to employees primarily based upon years of service and employees’ compensation for certain periods during the last years of employment. Prior to 2002, the Company’s U.S. operations also provided post-retirement medical benefits to their employees. Contributions for medical benefits are related to employee years of service.\nThe following tables set forth the change in benefit obligation, the change in plan assets, the funded status, and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements for the Company’s defined benefit plans and post-retirement plan at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nF-31\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe change in the benefit obligation for 2021 and 2020 is primarily related to the impact of foreign currency and a plan amendment within one of the Company's non-U.S. plans.\nThe accumulated benefit obligations at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n141.9\nmillion and $\n149.9\nmillion, respectively, for the U.S. defined benefit pension plan and $\n867.0\nmillion and $\n920.3\nmillion, respectively, for all non-U.S. plans. Certain of the plans included within non-U.S. pension benefits have accumulated benefit obligations which exceed the fair value of plan assets. The projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of assets of these plans as of December 31, 2021 were $\n181.3\nmillion, $\n174.1\nmillion, and $\n40.3\nmillion, respectively. The projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of assets of these plans as of December 31, 2020 were $\n216.7\nmillion, $\n205.3\nmillion, and $\n57.4\nmillion, respectively.\nAmounts recognized in the consolidated balance sheets consist of:\nThe following amounts have been recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), before taxes, at December 31, 2021 and have not yet been recognized as a component of net periodic pension cost:\nThe following changes in plan assets and benefit obligations were recognized in other comprehensive income (loss), before taxes, for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nF-32\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe assumed discount rates and rates of increase in future compensation levels used in calculating the projected benefit obligations vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which the retirement plans are situated. The weighted average rates used for the purposes of the Company’s plans are as follows:\nThe assumed discount rates, rates of increase in future compensation levels, and the long-term rate of return used in calculating the net periodic pension cost vary according to the economic conditions of the country in which the retirement plans are situated. The weighted average rates used for the purposes of the Company’s plans are as follows:\nNet periodic pension cost and net periodic post-retirement benefit for the defined benefit plans and U.S. post-retirement plan include the following components for the years ended December 31:\nThe projected post-retirement benefit obligation was principally determined using discount rates of\n1.94\n% in 2021 and\n1.47\n% in 2020. Net periodic post-retirement benefit cost was principally determined using discount rates of\n1.47\n% in 2021,\n2.54\n% in 2020, and\n3.75\n% in 2019. The health care cost trend rate was\n5.9\n% in 2021,\n6.0\n% in 2020, and\n6.2\n% in 2019, decreasing to\n4.50\n% in 2029.\nThe Company’s overall asset investment strategy is to achieve long-term growth while minimizing volatility by widely diversifying among asset types and strategies. Target asset allocations and investment return criteria are established by the pension committee or designated officers of each plan.\nTarget asset allocation ranges for the U.S. pension plan include 40-60% in equity securities, 23-33% in fixed income securities, and 15-25% in other types of investments.\nInternational plan assets relate primarily to the Company’s Swiss plan with target allocations of 24-45% in equities, 35-55% in fixed income securities, and 15-25% in other types of investments.\nActual results are monitored against targets and the trustees are required to report to the members of each plan, including an analysis of investment performance on an\nF-33\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nannual basis at a minimum. Day-to-day asset management is typically performed by third-party asset managers, reporting to the pension committees or designated officers.\nThe long-term rate of return on plan asset assumptions used to determine pension expense under U.S. GAAP is generally based on estimated future returns for the target investment mix determined by the trustees as well as historical investment performance.\nThe following table presents the fair value measurement of the Company’s plan assets by hierarchy level:\n_______________________________________\n(1)\nRepresents primarily large capitalization equity mutual funds tracking the S&P 500 Index.\n(2)\nRepresents all capitalization core and value equity mutual funds located primarily in Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Canada.\n(3)\nRepresents core and growth mutual funds and funds of mutual funds invested in emerging markets primarily in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and Asia.\n(4)\nRepresents investments in high-grade corporate and government bonds located in Switzerland and the European Union.\n(5)\nRepresents fixed and variable rate annuity contracts provided by insurance companies.\nF-34\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\n(6)\nRepresents fixed income mutual funds invested in the U.S., the United Kingdom, Switzerland, and European government bonds, high-grade corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities, and collateralized mortgage obligations.\n(7)\nRepresents mutual funds invested in real estate located primarily in Switzerland.\n(8)\nRepresents commodity funds invested across a broad range of sectors.\n(9)\nRepresents a loan to a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company. See Note 10 for additional disclosure.\n(10)\nRepresents mutual funds invested globally in both equities and fixed income securities.\n(11)\nRepresents currency hedged versions of the non-currency hedged equity funds held in the United Kingdom.\n(12)\nRepresents a broadly diversified portfolio of assets that carry exposure to insurance risks, particularly insurance linked securities.\n(13)\nInvestments that are measured using the net asset value (NAV) per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy. The amounts presented above are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the fair value of total plan assets in order to determine the amounts included in the consolidated balance sheet.\nThe fair values of the Company’s stock and corporate and government bonds are valued at the year-end closing price as reported on the securities exchange on which they are traded. Mutual funds are valued at the exchange-listed year-end closing price or at the net asset value of shares held by the fund at the end of the year. Insurance contracts are valued by discounting the related cash flows using a current year-end market rate or at cash surrender value, which is presumed to equal fair value. Funds of hedge funds are valued at the net asset value of shares held by the fund at the end of the year.\nThe following table presents a roll-forward of activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for Level 3 asset categories:\nThere were no transfers between any asset levels during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nF-35\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe following benefit payments, which reflect expected future service as appropriate, are expected to be paid:\nIn 2022, the Company expects to make employer pension contributions of approximately $\n28.2\nmillion to its non-U.S. pension plan and employer contributions of approximately $\n0.1\nmillion to its U.S. post-retirement medical plan.\n14.\nTAXES\nThe sources of the Company’s earnings before taxes were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nThe provision for taxes consists of:\nF-36\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe provision for tax expense differed from the amounts computed by applying the United States federal income tax rate of\n21\n% for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 to earnings before taxes as a result of the following:\nThe Company’s reported effective tax rate was\n19.0\n% in 2021,\n19.5\n% in 2020, and\n17.7\n% in 2019.\nAs discussed below, the provision for income taxes included a net benefit of $\n15.8\nmillion in 2019 related to Swiss tax reform, which had the effect of reducing the Company’s effective tax rate by\n2.3\n% in 2019.\nIn May 2019, a public referendum was held in Switzerland that approved Swiss federal tax reform proposals previously approved by the Swiss Parliament. Additional changes in Swiss cantonal law were enacted in October 2019 (collectively Swiss Tax Reform). The changes in Swiss federal tax had an immaterial effect on our financial statements. As a result of the enactment of the cantonal law, the Company recognized a deferred tax asset of $\n48.1\nmillion less a valuation allowance of $\n31.9\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2019. The amount primarily related to deferred benefits associated with an allowed step-up of intangible assets for tax purposes. The rate impact of Swiss Tax Reform was effective     January 1, 2020 and did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated effective tax rate.\nF-37\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe tax effects of temporary differences that give rise to significant portions of the deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are presented below at December 31:\nThe Company continues to record valuation allowances related to certain of its deferred income tax assets due to the uncertainty of the ultimate realization of future benefits from such assets. The potential decrease or increase of the valuation allowance in the near term is dependent on the future ability of the Company to realize the deferred tax assets that are affected by the future profitability of operations in the respective/relevant jurisdictions.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nIncluded in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n46.4\nmillion and $\n38.3\nmillion, respectively, of tax benefits that if recognized would reduce the Company’s effective tax rate. Increases and decreases related to current and prior year tax positions during 2021 and 2020 primarily related to non-United States income taxes. The Company recognizes accrued amounts of interest and penalties related to its uncertain tax positions as part of its income tax expense within its consolidated statement of operations. The amount of accrued interest and penalties included\nF-38\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nwithin other non-current liabilities within the Company’s consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n7.7\nmillion and $\n6.2\nmillion, respectively.\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefit balance could change over the next 12 months, primarily related to potential disputes raised by the taxing authorities over income and expense recognition. The Company does not expect a change would have a material impact on its financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nThe Company plans to repatriate earnings from China, Switzerland, Germany, the United Kingdom, and certain other countries in future years and believes that there will be no additional tax costs associated with the repatriation of such foreign earnings other than non-U.S. withholding taxes, certain state taxes, and U.S. taxes on currency gains, if any, for which a deferred tax liability has been recognized. All other undistributed earnings and any additional outside basis difference inherent in these entities and the contributed capital of our foreign subsidiaries are considered to be permanently reinvested on which no U.S. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding taxes have been provided. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of deferred tax liability related to these undistributed earnings and additional outside basis differences in these entities due to the complexity of the calculation and the uncertainty regarding assumptions necessary to compute the tax.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the major jurisdictions for which the Company is subject to examinations are: Germany for years after 2015; the United States after 2017; France after 2019; Switzerland after 2019; the United Kingdom after 2018; and China after 2018. Additionally, the Company is currently under examination in various taxing jurisdictions in which it conducts business operations. While the Company has not yet received any material assessments from these taxing authorities, the Company believes that adequate amounts of taxes and related interest and penalties have been provided for any adverse adjustments as a result of these examinations and that the ultimate outcome of these examinations will not result in a material impact on the Company’s consolidated results of operations or financial position.\n15.\nOTHER CHARGES (INCOME), NET\nOther charges (income), net consisted of net other income of $\n3.1\nmillion, $\n13.8\nmillion, and $\n6.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Other charges (income), net includes non-service pension costs (benefits), net (gains) losses from foreign currency transactions and hedging activities, interest income, and other items. Non-service pension benefits were $\n11.4\nmillion, $\n12.2\nmillion, and $\n4.8\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Other charges (income), net also includes $\n3.4\nmillion of acquisition costs for the year ended December 31, 2021, as well as a $\n6.8\nmillion charge to increase the PendoTECH acquisition contingent consideration and related obligations to the sellers.\n16.\nLEASES\nThe Company adopted ASC 842 - Leases with an effective date of January 1, 2019. The operating lease right-of-use asset recognized upon adoption was $\n92.7\nmillion, and the lease liability was $\n93.5\nmillion. The Company elected the practical expedients package under ASC 842, and accordingly did not reassess any previously expired or existing arrangements, and related classification under ASC 840 - Leases.\nF-39\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe Company’s operating leases primarily comprise real estate and vehicles. Real estate leases are largely related to sales and marketing, service, and administrative offices, while vehicle leases are primarily related to the Company’s field sales and service organization. The consolidated balance sheet included the following balances as of December 31:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has not entered into any material real estate operating leases expected to commence in 2022.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had the following recorded in selling, general, and administrative associated with leasing arrangements:\nAccruals and other on the consolidated statement of cash flows includes the amortization of the lease right-of-use asset of $\n33.7\nmillion, $\n32.1\nmillion, and $\n31.1\nmillion, offset by a change in the lease liability of $\n33.7\nmillion, $\n31.7\nmillion, and $\n30.1\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Lease payments within operating activities were $\n35.5\nmillion, $\n36.0\nmillion, and $\n33.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The Company also obtained non-cash lease right-of-use assets in exchange for lease liabilities of $\n46.4\nmillion, $\n35.0\nmillion, and $\n25.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nF-40\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe following is a maturity analysis of the annual undiscounted cash flows for the annual periods ended December 31:\n17.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nLegal\nThe Company is party to various legal proceedings, including certain environmental matters, incidental to the normal course of business. Management does not expect that any of such proceedings will have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n18.\nSEGMENT REPORTING\nThe Company has five reportable segments: U.S. Operations, Swiss Operations, Western European Operations, Chinese Operations, and Other. U.S. Operations represent certain of the Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in the United States. Western European Operations include the Company’s marketing and producing organizations in Western Europe, excluding operations located in Switzerland. Swiss Operations include marketing and producing organizations located in Switzerland as well as extensive R&D operations that are responsible for the development, production, and marketing of precision instruments, including weighing, analytical, and measurement technologies for use in a variety of laboratory and industrial applications. Chinese Operations represent the Company’s marketing and producing organizations located in China. The Company’s market organizations are geographically focused and are responsible for all aspects of the Company’s sales and service. Operations that exist outside these reportable segments are included in Other.\nThe accounting policies of the operating segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies. The Company evaluates performance based on segment profit for segment reporting (gross profit less research and development and selling, general, and administrative expenses, before amortization, interest expense, restructuring charges, other charges (income), net, and taxes). Inter-segment sales and transfers are priced to reflect consideration of market conditions and the regulations of the countries in which the transferring entities are located.\nF-41\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe following tables show the operations of the Company’s reportable segments:\n(a)\nOther includes reporting units in Southeast Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe, and other countries.\n(b)\nEliminations and Corporate includes the elimination of intersegment transactions as well as certain corporate expenses and intercompany investments, which are not included in the Company’s operating segments.\nA reconciliation of earnings before taxes to segment profit follows:\nF-42\nMETTLER-TOLEDO INTERNATIONAL INC.\nNOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(In thousands, except share data, unless otherwise stated)\nThe Company sells precision instruments, including weighing instruments and certain analytical and measurement technologies, and related services to a variety of customers and industries.
