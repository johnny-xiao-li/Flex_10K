    "text": "General\nErie Indemnity Company (\"Indemnity\", \"we\", \"us\", \"our\") is a publicly held Pennsylvania business corporation that has since its incorporation in 1925 served as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the Erie Insurance Exchange (\"Exchange\").  The Exchange, which also commenced business in 1925, is a Pennsylvania-domiciled reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance.  The Exchange has wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries including:  Erie Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Company of New York, Erie Insurance Property & Casualty Company and Flagship City Insurance Company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, Erie Family Life Insurance Company (\"EFL\").\nOur primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to all claims handling and investment management services, as well as the service provider for all claims handling, life insurance, and investment management services for its insurance subsidiaries, collectively referred to as \"administrative services\".  Acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities is done in accordance with a subscriber's agreement (a limited power of attorney) executed individually by each subscriber (policyholder), which appoints us as their common attorney-in-fact to transact certain business on their behalf.  Pursuant to the subscriber’s agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we earn a management fee calculated as a percentage, not to exceed 25%, of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The management fee rate is set at least annually by our Board of Directors.  The process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both Indemnity and the Exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position.\nServices\nThe policy issuance and renewal services we provide to the Exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies.  The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services.  Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures.  Agent compensation comprised approximately 66% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 10% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.  We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 11% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal  expenses.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.\nBy virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to Indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nErie Insurance Exchange\nAs our primary purpose is to manage the affairs at the Exchange for the benefit of the subscribers (policyholders) through the policy issuance and renewal services and administrative services, the Exchange is our sole customer.  Our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  We have no direct competition in providing these services to the Exchange.\nThe Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 70% of the 2021 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 30%.  The principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  The principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.  Historically, due to policy renewal and sales patterns, the Exchange's direct and affiliated assumed written premiums are greater in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters of the calendar year.\n3\nThe Exchange is represented by independent agencies that serve as its sole distribution channel.  In addition to their principal role as salespersons, the independent agents play a significant role as underwriting and service providers and are an integral part of the Exchange's success.\nOur results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange.  If any events occurred that impaired the Exchange's ability to grow or sustain its financial condition, including but not limited to reduced financial strength ratings, disruption in the independent agency relationships, significant catastrophe losses, or products not meeting customer demands, the Exchange could find it more difficult to retain its existing business and attract new business.  A decline in the business of the Exchange almost certainly would have as a consequence a decline in the total premiums paid and a correspondingly adverse effect on the amount of the management fees we receive.  We also have an exposure to a concentration of credit risk related to the unsecured receivables due from the Exchange for its management fee and cost reimbursements.  See Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 15, Concentrations of Credit Risk, of Notes to Financial Statements\" contained within this report.  See the risk factors related to our dependency on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report.\nCompetition\nOur primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.  There are a limited number of companies that provide services under a reciprocal insurance exchange structure.  We do not directly compete against other such companies, given we are appointed by the subscribers at the Exchange to provide these services.\nThe direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange drive our management fee which is our primary source of revenue.  The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive.  Property and casualty insurers generally compete on the basis of customer service, price, consumer recognition, coverages offered, claims handling, financial stability and geographic coverage.  Vigorous competition, particularly in the personal lines automobile and homeowners lines of business, is provided by large, well-capitalized national companies, some of which have broad distribution networks of employed or captive agents, by smaller regional insurers, and by large companies who market and sell personal lines products directly to consumers.  Innovations by competitors or other market participants may also increase the level of competition in the industry.  In addition, because the insurance products of the Exchange are marketed exclusively through independent insurance agents, the Exchange faces competition within its appointed agencies based upon ease of doing business, product, price, and service\nrelationships.\nMarket competition bears directly on the price charged for insurance products and services subject to regulatory limitations.  Industry capital levels can also significantly affect prices charged for coverage.  Growth is driven by a company's ability to provide insurance services and competitive prices while maintaining target profit margins.  Growth is a product of a company's ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers, as well as movement in the average premium per policy.\nThe Exchange's business model is designed to provide the advantages of localized marketing and claims servicing with the economies of scale and low cost of operations from centralized support services.  The Exchange also carefully selects the independent agencies that represent it and seeks to be the lead insurer with its agents in order to enhance the agency relationship and the likelihood of receiving the most desirable underwriting opportunities from its agents.\nThe Exchange’s strategic focus as a reciprocal insurer is to employ a disciplined underwriting philosophy and to leverage its strong surplus position to generate higher risk adjusted investment returns.  The goal is to produce acceptable returns, on a long-term basis, through careful risk selection, rational pricing and superior investment returns.  This focus allows the Exchange to accomplish its mission of providing as near perfect protection, as near perfect service as is humanly possible at the lowest possible costs.\nSee the risk factors related to our dependency on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange in Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report for further discussion on competition in the insurance industry.\n4\nHuman Capital Management\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract, retain, and develop diverse talent while maintaining our service-based culture.  We strive to create a value proposition for our employees through trust and collaboration while providing competitive compensation, benefits, and other reward programs.  Our low turnover and high tenure are reflective of our culture and the mutual commitment that exists between employees and the company.\nOur human capital management strategy, including initiatives to shape our workforce and workplace, is designed to ensure we are well positioned for the future.  Areas of focus include talent acquisition, performance management, succession planning, learning and development, and diversity and inclusion.  Our investments in human capital include comprehensive total rewards and programs aimed at developing our employees to be successful in their current and future roles.  We hold a shared responsibility view of retirement planning whereby the company provides tools and resources that employees are expected to use to achieve their retirement goals.  We set ourselves apart by offering both a 401(k) plan and a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan.\nWe use the following human capital metrics as part of managing our business\n:\n(1)  Includes 50% of employees who provide claims and life insurance management services exclusively for the Exchange and its subsidiaries.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us monthly for the cost of these services.\n(2)  Temporary employees are hired for short-term work and paid directly by us.\n(3)  The percentage of employees who left voluntarily or involuntarily, including retirements.  Calculated using the number of employees who exited, divided by the average headcount of the period.\n(4)  The average number of years employees have been employed with the organization.  Total number of years divided by average headcount of full-time and part-time employees for the period.\nThe tightening labor market during the COVID-19 pandemic has increased competition to attract and retain talent.  In 2021, a large portion of the increase in our turnover can be attributed to voluntary turnover, which increased from 3.0% and 2.4% in 2019 and 2020, respectively, to 4.8% in 2021.  ERIE continues to monitor its turnover trends to determine the appropriate actions to ensure we are well positioned for the future.\nAs we recognize the importance of employee engagement on the outcomes we achieve as an organization, we also work with independent external partners to administer confidential surveys to collect feedback on the employee experience.  We have partnered with the Great Place to Work® (\"GPTW\") Institute since 2012.  We received the honor of being Great Place to Work-Certified™ in 2020 and 2017, and Great-rated in 2014.  Our overall GPTW score has trended upwards over the last three surveys and is favorable compared to the benchmark of the companies ranked on the Great Place to Work® Top 100 Companies List.  Since our last full survey in 2020, we have conducted several employee pulse surveys to continue to monitor employee engagement.\n5\nGovernment Regulation\nMost states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.  Indemnity and the Exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.\nEach insurance company in the holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory authority of its state of domicile and furnish information regarding the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations, management, or financial condition of the insurers within the system.  Pursuant to these laws, the respective insurance departments may examine us and the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries at any time, and may require disclosure and/or prior approval of certain transactions with the insurers and us, as an insurance holding company.\nAll transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  Approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.\nWebsite Access\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to those reports are available free of charge on our website at\nwww.erieinsurance.com\nas soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed electronically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  Additionally, copies of our annual report on Form 10-K are available free of charge, upon written request, by contacting Investor Relations, Erie Indemnity Company,     100 Erie Insurance Place, Erie, PA 16530, or calling (800) 458-0811."

    "text": "Our business involves various risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to those discussed in this section.  The risks and uncertainties described in the risk factors below, or any additional risk outside of those discussed below, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, or liquidity if they were to develop into actual events.  This information should be considered carefully together with the other information contained in this report and in other reports and materials we file periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\nOur risks have been divided into the following categories:\nRisks related to Erie Insurance Exchange\n– risks related to our dependence on our relationship with the Exchange associated with management fees, premium growth, and financial condition, as the Exchange is our sole customer and principal source of revenue\nOperating risks\n– risks stemming from events or circumstances that directly or indirectly affect our operations, including our operations as attorney-in-fact for the Exchange\nMarket, Capital, and Liquidity risks\n– risks that may impact the values or results of our investment portfolio, ability to meet financial obligations or covenants, or obtain capital as necessary\nAlthough we have organized risks generally according to these categories in the discussion below, risks may have impacts in more than one category and are included where the impact is most significant.\nRisks related to Erie Insurance Exchange\nIf the management fee rate paid by the Exchange is reduced or if there is a significant decrease in the amount of direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nWe are dependent upon management fees paid by the Exchange, which represent our principal source of revenue.  Pursuant to the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the Exchange, we may retain up to 25% of all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  Therefore, management fee revenue from the Exchange is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  Accordingly, any reduction in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange and/or the management fee rate would have a negative effect on our revenues and net income.\n6\nThe management fee rate is determined by our Board of Directors and may not exceed 25% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The Board of Directors sets the management fee rate each December for the following year.  At their discretion, the rate can be changed at any time.  The process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both Indemnity and the Exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position.  The evaluation of these factors could result in a reduction to the management fee rate and our revenues and profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nServing as the attorney-in-fact in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure results in the Exchange being our sole customer.  We have an interest in the growth of the Exchange as our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  If the Exchange's ability to grow or renew policies were adversely impacted, the premium revenue of the Exchange would be adversely affected which would reduce our management fee revenue.  The circumstances or events that might impair the Exchange's ability to grow include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.\nUnfavorable changes in macroeconomic conditions for any reason, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, lower demand for certain services, reduced personal income, and recession, among others, may lead the Exchange's customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the Exchange, and consequently our management fee.\nThe Exchange faces significant competition from other regional and national insurance companies.  The property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive on the basis of product, price and service.  If the Exchange's competitors offer property and casualty products with more coverage or offer lower rates, and the Exchange is unable to implement product improvements quickly enough to keep pace, its ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted.  In addition, due to the Exchange's premium concentration in the automobile and homeowners insurance markets, it may be more sensitive to trends that could affect auto and home insurance coverages and rates over time, for example changing vehicle usage, usage-based methods of determining premiums, ownership and driving patterns such as ride sharing or remote work, advancements in vehicle or home technology or safety features such as accident and loss prevention technologies, the development of autonomous vehicles, or residential occupancy patterns, among other factors. Innovations by competitors or other market participants may increase the level of competition in the industry.  If the Exchange fails to respond to those innovations on a timely basis, its competitive position and results may be materially adversely affected.\nThe Exchange markets and sells its insurance products through independent, non-exclusive insurance agencies.  These agencies are not obligated to sell only the Exchange's insurance products, and generally also sell products of the Exchange's competitors.  If agencies do not maintain their current levels of marketing efforts, bind the Exchange to unacceptable risks, or place business with competing insurers, or if the Exchange is unsuccessful in attracting or retaining agencies in its distribution system or maintaining its relationships with those agencies, the Exchange's ability to grow and renew its business may be adversely impacted.  More broadly, if independent agents face challenges sustaining their own business operations due to unfavorable economic conditions, it could result in the sale or closure of their businesses, thereby reducing the agency force of the Exchange.   Additionally, shifting consumer behaviors toward increased digital interactions may cause the insurance industry as a whole to migrate to a delivery system other than independent agencies.\nThe Exchange maintains a brand recognized for customer service.  The perceived performance, actions, conduct and behaviors of employees, independent insurance agency representatives, and third-party service partners may result in reputational harm to the Exchange's brand.  Specific incidents which may cause harm include but are not limited to disputes, long customer wait times, errors in processing a claim, failure to protect sensitive customer data, and negative or inaccurate social media or traditional media communications.  Likewise, an inability to match or exceed the service provided by competitors, which is increasingly relying on digital delivery and enhanced distribution technology, may impede the Exchange's ability to maintain and/or grow its customer base.  If third-party service providers fail to perform as anticipated, the Exchange may experience operational difficulties, increased costs and reputational damage.  If an extreme catastrophic event were to occur in a heavily concentrated geographic area of subscribers/policyholders, an extraordinarily high number of claims could have the potential to strain claims processing and affect the Exchange's ability to satisfy its customers.  Also, we, or the Exchange, may fail to meet environmental, social, and governance (ESG) expectations of our customers or other interested parties.  Failure to satisfy expectations in these areas may result in negative publicity or other adverse outcomes.  Any reputational harm to the Exchange could have the potential to impair its ability to grow and renew its business.\n7\nWe have an interest in the financial condition of the Exchange based on serving as the attorney-in-fact in the reciprocal insurance exchange structure and the Exchange being our sole customer.  If the Exchange were to fail to maintain acceptable financial strength ratings, its competitive position in the insurance industry would be adversely affected.  If a rating downgrade led to customers not renewing or canceling policies, or impacted the Exchange's ability to attract new customers, the premium revenue of the Exchange would be adversely affected which would reduce our management fee revenue.  The circumstances or events that might impair the Exchange's financial condition include, but are not limited to, the items discussed below.\nFinancial strength ratings are an important factor in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies such as the Exchange.  Higher ratings generally indicate greater financial stability and a stronger ability to meet ongoing obligations to policyholders.  The Exchange's A.M. Best rating is currently A+ (\"Superior\").  A.M. Best periodically reviews the Exchange’s ratings and changes their rating criteria; therefore, the Exchange's current rating may not be maintained in the future.  A significant downgrade in the A.M. Best rating could reduce the competitive position of the Exchange, making it more difficult to attract profitable business in the highly competitive property and casualty insurance market and potentially result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.\nThe performance of the Exchange's investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks.  The Exchange's investment portfolio is comprised principally of fixed income securities, equity securities and limited partnerships.  The fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to, interest rate risk, investment credit risk,                       sector/concentration risk and liquidity risk.  The Exchange's common stock and preferred equity securities have exposure to price risk, the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices.  Limited partnerships are significantly less liquid and generally involve higher degrees of price risk than publicly traded securities.  Limited partnerships, like publicly traded securities, have exposure to market volatility; but unlike fixed income securities, cash flows and return expectations are less predictable.  If any investments in the Exchange's investment portfolio were to suffer a substantial decrease in value, the Exchange's financial position could be materially adversely affected through increased unrealized losses or impairments.  A significant decrease in the Exchange's portfolio could also put it, or its subsidiaries, at risk of failing to satisfy regulatory or rating agency minimum capital requirements.\nProperty and casualty insurers are subject to extensive regulatory supervision in the states in which they do business.  This regulatory oversight includes, by way of example, matters relating to licensing, examination, rate setting, market conduct, policy forms, limitations on the nature and amount of certain investments, claims practices, mandated participation in involuntary markets and guaranty funds, reserve adequacy, insurer solvency, restrictions on underwriting standards, accounting standards, and transactions between affiliates.  Such regulation and supervision are primarily for the benefit and protection of policyholders.  Changes in applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, regulations, or changes in the way regulators administer those laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact the Exchange's business, cash flows, results of operations, financial condition, or operating environment and increase its exposure to loss or put it at a competitive disadvantage, which could result in reduced sales of its products and lower premium revenue.\nProperty and casualty insurers face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating their businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries have also been named as defendants in a number of pandemic-related lawsuits and, therefore, are subject to the risks and uncertainties of such litigation.   Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against the Exchange may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time.  The Exchange is also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities.\nThe uncertainty of risks that emerge upon the occurrence of significant unexpected events, such as pandemics, may cause additional challenges in the process of estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves. For example, the behavior of claimants and policyholders may change in unexpected ways, the disruption to the court system may impact the timing and amounts of claims settlements, and the actions taken by governmental bodies, both legislative and regulatory, in reaction to a pandemic or other significant unexpected events, and their related impacts, are hard to predict. Among other things, this may result in changes to the Exchange's estimated level of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves.\nAs insurance industry practices and legal, judicial, social and other environmental conditions change, unexpected and unintended issues related to claims and coverage may emerge.  In some instances, these emerging issues may not become apparent for some time after the Exchange has issued the affected insurance policies.  As a result, the full extent of liability under the Exchange's insurance policies may not be known for many years after the policies are issued.  These issues may adversely affect the Exchange's business by either extending coverage beyond its underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims.  If there were legislative action in response to a pandemic or other significant unexpected event that retroactively mandated coverage irrespective of terms, exclusions or other conditions included in policies, such as business interruption, that would otherwise preclude coverage, it could have a material impact on the financial condition, results of operations and cash flows of the Exchange.\n8\nThe Exchange's insurance operations are exposed to claims arising out of catastrophes.  Common natural catastrophic events include hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, hail storms, and severe winter weather.  The frequency and severity of these catastrophes is inherently unpredictable.  Changing climate conditions have added to the unpredictability, frequency and severity of natural disasters and have created additional uncertainty as to future trends and exposures.  A single catastrophic occurrence or aggregation of multiple smaller occurrences within the geographical region of the Exchange or its assumed property reinsurance portfolio could adversely affect the financial condition of the Exchange.  Man-made disasters such as terrorist attacks and riots could also cause losses from insurance claims related to the property and casualty insurance operations, which could adversely affect its financial condition.\nOperating risks\nIf the costs of providing services to the Exchange are not controlled, our profitability could be materially adversely affected.\nPursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we perform policy issuance and renewal services for the subscribers at the Exchange and we serve as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services. The most significant costs we incur in providing policy issuance and renewal services are commissions, employee costs, and technology costs.\nCommissions to independent agents are our largest expense.  Commissions include scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving certain targeted measures.  Changes to commission rates or bonus programs may result in increased future costs and lower profitability.  Our agent incentive bonuses include a profitability component.  If claims frequency and loss expenses were to decrease significantly as a result of an unexpected event, such as a pandemic, the profitability component of our agent incentive bonuses would improve, and our agent compensation costs would increase.  Our second largest expense is employee costs, including salaries, healthcare, pension, and other benefit costs.  Regulatory developments, provider relationships, pandemics and demographic and economic factors that are beyond our control indicate that employee healthcare costs could continue to increase which could reduce our profitability. The defined benefit pension plan we offer to our employees is affected by variable factors such as the interest rate used to discount pension liabilities, asset performance and changes in retirement patterns, which are beyond our control and any related future costs increases would reduce our profitability.\nTechnological development is necessary to facilitate ease of doing business for employees, agents and customers.  Our technological developments are focused on simplifying and improving the employee, agent and customer experiences, increasing efficiencies, redesigning products and addressing other potentially disruptive changes in the insurance industry.  As we continue to develop technology initiatives in order to remain competitive, our profitability could be negatively impacted as we invest in system development.  We may also experience increased technology costs as we re-design hybrid work models for our employees.\nIf we are unable to attract, develop, and retain talented executives, key managers, and employees our financial conditions and results of operations could be adversely affected.\nOur success is largely dependent upon our ability to attract and retain talented executives and other key management.  Talent is defined as people with the right skills, knowledge, abilities, character, and motivation.  The loss of the services and leadership of certain key officers and the failure to plan for turnover or retirement or to attract and develop talented new executives and managers could prevent us from successfully communicating, implementing, and executing business strategies.\nOur success also depends on our ability to attract, develop, and retain a talented employee base.  The inability to staff all functions of our business with employees possessing the appropriate talent or failure to instill appropriate cultural expectations and behavioral norms within our employees could have an adverse effect on our business performance.  Additionally, failure to recognize, evaluate, and respond to changing workforce trends including current labor market conditions and new ways of managing in hybrid work environments, or failure to execute proactive retention and replacement strategies could also have an adverse effect on our business performance.  Staffing appropriately talented employees for the handling of claims and servicing of customers, rendering of disciplined underwriting, and effective sales and marketing are critical to the core functions of our business.  In addition, talented employees in the actuarial, finance, human resources, information technology, law, and risk management areas are also essential to support our core functions.\n9\nIf we are unable to ensure system availability or effectively manage technology initiatives, we may experience adverse financial consequences and/or may be unable to compete effectively.\nOur business is highly dependent upon the effectiveness of our technology and information systems which support key functions of our core business operations including processing applications and premium payments, providing customer support, performing actuarial and financial analysis, and maintaining key data.  Additionally, the Exchange relies heavily on technology systems for processing claims.  In order to support our business processes and strategic initiatives in a cost and resource efficient manner, we must maintain the effectiveness of existing technology systems and continue to identify and develop new, and enhance existing, technology systems.  As we invest in the development of our systems, costs and completion times could exceed original estimates, and/or the project may not deliver the anticipated benefit or perform as expected.  If we do not effectively and efficiently manage and upgrade our technology systems, our ability to serve our customers and implement our strategic initiatives could be adversely impacted.\nAdditionally, we depend on a large amount of data to price policies appropriately, track exposures, perform financial analysis, report to regulatory bodies, and ultimately make business decisions.  Should this data be inaccurate or insufficient, risk exposure may be underestimated and/or poor business decisions may be made.  This may in turn lead to adverse operational or financial performance and adverse customer or investor confidence.\nIf we experience difficulties with technology, data and network security, including as a result of cyber attacks, third-party relationships or cloud-based relationships, our ability to conduct our business could be adversely impacted.\nIn the normal course of business, we collect, use, store and where appropriate, disclose data concerning individuals and businesses.  We also conduct business using third parties who may provide software, data storage, cloud-based computing and other technology services.  We have on occasion experienced, and will continue to experience, cyber threats to our data and systems.  Cyber threats can create significant risks such as destruction of systems or data, denial or interruption of service, disruption of transaction execution, loss or exposure of customer data, theft or exposure of our intellectual property, theft of funds or disruption of other important business functions.  Our interactions with third parties may expose us to increased risk related to data security, service disruptions or effectiveness of our control system.\nIn addition, we are subject to numerous federal and state data privacy laws relating to the privacy of the nonpublic personal information of our customers, employees and others.  The improper access, disclosure, or misuse or mishandling of information sent to or received from a customer, employee or third party could result in legal liability, regulatory action and reputational damage.  Third parties on whom we rely for certain business processing functions are also subject to these risks, and their failure to adhere to these laws and regulations could negatively impact us.\nOur Board of Directors oversees our activities with respect to managing cyber risk through its Risk Committee. Management regularly reports on our cybersecurity risk management program including our risk evaluation and the results of independent third-party security assessments, and our efforts to manage cyber related risks.\nWe employ a company-wide cybersecurity program of technical, administrative, physical and disclosure controls intended to reduce the risk of cyber threats and protect our information, as well as to communicate potential material threats and incidents.  Our cybersecurity philosophy and approach align to the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework and its core elements to identify, protect, detect, respond and recover from the various forms of cyber threats.  Our practices include, but are not limited to, cybersecurity protocols and controls, system monitoring and detection, communication of incidents to appropriate management, third-party risk management, including assessments of emerging threats and vulnerabilities, and ongoing privacy and cybersecurity training for employees and contractors concerning cyber risk. We periodically assess the effectiveness of our cybersecurity efforts including independent validation and verification and security assessments conducted by independent third parties.\nThe number, complexity and sophistication of cyber threats continue to increase over time. While we maintain cyber liability insurance to mitigate the financial risk around cyber incidents, such insurance may not cover all costs associated with the consequences of information or systems being compromised. Additionally, while we have dedicated resources with security incident response capabilities, our response process may not be adequate, may fail to accurately assess the severity of an incident, may not respond quickly enough or may fail to sufficiently remediate an incident.  As a result, we may suffer significant legal, reputational, or financial losses, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition or results of operations.\n10\nTo date, we are not aware of any material cybersecurity breach with respect to our systems or data.  Additionally, we are not aware of any cybersecurity breach experienced by anyone with whom we have a third-party relationship that has had a material impact on our systems or data.\nIf events occurred causing interruption of our operations, facilities, systems or business functions, it could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results.\nWe have established business continuity and disaster recovery plans to ensure the continuation of core business operations in the event that normal business operations could not be performed due to catastrophic or other events, including pandemics.  While we continue to test and assess our business continuity and disaster recovery plans to validate they meet the needs of our core business operations and addresses multiple business interruption events, there is no assurance that core business operations could be performed upon the occurrence of such an event.  Employee absence, physical premises damage, systems failures or outages could compromise our ability to perform our business functions in a timely manner, which could harm our ability to conduct business and hurt our relationships with our business partners and customers.  Our operational resiliency is also dependent on third-party personnel, infrastructure and systems on which we rely.  Our operations and those of our third parties may become vulnerable to damage or disruption due to circumstances beyond our or their control, such as from catastrophic events, power anomalies or outages, natural disasters, pandemics, supply chain interruptions, network failures, and cyber attacks.  Additionally, we are more dependent on internet and telecommunications access and capabilities.  Indemnity’s workforce is largely concentrated in Erie, Pennsylvania. If a significant event affects the labor force in this area, it could impact the policy acquisition, underwriting, claims and/or support services provided to the policyholders and/or independent agents of the Exchange.  Disruptions to our workforce or our operations for any reason could result in a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition, or results of operations.\nWe are subject to applicable insurance laws, tax statutes, and regulations, as well as claims and legal proceedings, which, if determined unfavorably, could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, or financial condition.\nWe face a significant risk of litigation and regulatory investigations and actions in the ordinary course of operating our businesses including the risk of class action lawsuits.  We are, have been, or may become subject to class actions and individual suits alleging breach of fiduciary or other duties, including our obligations to indemnify directors and officers in connection with certain legal matters.  We are also subject to litigation arising out of our general business activities such as contractual and employment relationships and claims regarding the infringement of the intellectual property of others.  Plaintiffs in class action and other lawsuits against us may seek large or indeterminate amounts of damages, including punitive and treble damages, which may remain unknown for substantial periods of time. We are also subject to various regulatory inquiries, such as information requests, subpoenas, and books and record examinations from state and federal regulators and authorities.  In addition, changes in the way regulators administer applicable laws, tax statutes, or regulations could adversely impact our business, cash flows, results of operations, or financial condition.  It is also possible that changes in economic conditions and steps taken by federal, state and local governments in response to a pandemic or other significant events could cause an increase in taxes at the federal, state and local levels, which would adversely impact our results of operations.\nMarket, Capital, and Liquidity risks\nThe performance of our investment portfolio is subject to a variety of investment risks, which may in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition.\nAt December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio consisted of approximately 83% fixed maturity securities, with the remaining 17% invested in equity securities and other investments.\nGeneral economic conditions and other factors beyond our control can adversely affect the value of our investments and the realization of net investment income, or result in realized investment losses.  In addition, downward economic trends also may have an adverse effect on our investment results by negatively impacting the business conditions and impairing credit for the issuers of securities held in our respective investment portfolios.  This could reduce fair values of investments and generate significant unrealized losses or impairment charges which may adversely affect our financial results.\nThe performance of the fixed income portfolio is subject to a number of risks including, but not limited to:\n•\nInterest rate risk - the risk of adverse changes in the value of fixed income securities as a result of increases in market interest rates.\n11\n•\nInvestment credit risk - the risk that the value of certain investments may decrease due to the deterioration in financial condition of, or the liquidity available to, one or more issuers of those securities or, in the case of structured securities, due to the deterioration of the loans or other assets that underlie the securities, which, in each case, also includes the risk of permanent loss.\n•\nSector/Concentration risk - the risk that the portfolio may be too heavily concentrated in the securities of one or more issuers, sectors, or industries.  Events or developments that have a negative impact on any particular industry, group of related industries, or geographic region may have a greater adverse effect on our investment portfolio to the extent that the portfolio is concentrated within those issuers, sectors, or industries.\n•\nLiquidity risk - the risk that we will not be able to convert investment securities into cash on favorable terms and on a timely basis, or that we will not be able to sell them at all, when desired.  Disruptions in the financial markets or a lack of buyers for the specific securities that we are trying to sell, could prevent us from liquidating securities or cause a reduction in prices to levels that are not acceptable to us.\n•\nReinvestment risk - the possibility that the cash flows produced by an investment will have to be reinvested at a reduced rate of return.  Approximately 42% of our fixed maturity portfolio is expected to mature over the next three years.\nOur equity securities have exposure to price risk.  Equity markets, sectors, industries, and individual securities may also be subject to some of the same risks that affect our fixed income portfolio, as discussed above.\nAll of our fixed income and equity securities are subject to market volatility.  To the extent that future market volatility negatively impacts our investments, our financial condition will be negatively impacted.  We review the fixed income portfolio on a continuous basis to evaluate positions that are in an unrealized loss position to determine whether impairments are a result of credit loss or other factors.  Inherent in management's evaluation of a security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential.  The primary factors considered in our review of investment valuation include the extent to which fair value is less than cost, historical operating performance and financial condition of the issuer, short- and long-term prospects of the issuer and its industry, specific events that occurred affecting the issuer, including rating downgrades, and, depending on the type of security, our intent to sell or our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value.  As the process for determining impairments is highly subjective, changes in our assessments may have a material effect on our operating results and financial condition.  See also Part II, Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\".\nIn July 2017, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\"), which regulates the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that it intends to phase out LIBOR by the end of 2021.  After this date, the FCA would no longer require banks to make LIBOR submissions.  Following discussions with the FCA and other official sector bodies, the Intercontinental Exchange Benchmark Administration announced in March 2021 the publication of certain USD LIBOR settings will continue through June 30, 2023.  The Alternative Reference Rates Committee of the Federal Reserve Board (ARRC), a group of market participants convened to help ensure a successful transition away from LIBOR, has recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) as its preferred alternative reference rate and has proposed a transition plan and timeline designed to encourage the adoption of SOFR from LIBOR.  Volume in SOFR-linked products has increased significantly during 2021; however, LIBOR continues to be the dominant reference rate in use in the market today.\nWe have identified our population of contracts that contain a LIBOR reference and have determined that our primary exposure is in fixed income securities within our investment portfolio. Approximately 23% of our investment portfolio includes securities with LIBOR exposure where the stated final maturity date extends beyond June 30, 2023.  Many of our LIBOR indexed securities have fallback provisions that provide for an alternative reference rate when LIBOR ceases to exist.  For securities without adequate fallback provisions already in place, legislation governing securities under New York law has been enacted to provide a safe harbor for transition to the recommended alternative reference rate. In addition, federal legislation has been introduced to provide the same protection for securities not governed by New York law.\nWhile our preliminary analysis does not indicate that the transition of our investments to alternative reference rates will result in adverse changes to the net investment income, fair market value and return on those investments, we are still in the process of evaluation.  We continually monitor the risks associated with the LIBOR transition which include identifying and monitoring our exposure to LIBOR, monitoring the market adoption of alternative reference rates and ensuring operational processes are updated to accommodate alternative rates.    Due to uncertainty surrounding alternative rates, we are unable to predict the overall impact of this change at this time.\n12\nDeteriorating capital and credit market conditions or a failure to accurately estimate capital needs may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.\nSufficient liquidity and capital levels are required to pay operating expenses, income taxes, and to provide the necessary resources to fund future growth opportunities, satisfy certain financial covenants, pay dividends on common stock, and repurchase common stock.  Management estimates the appropriate level of capital necessary based upon current and projected results, which includes evaluating potential risks.  Failure to accurately estimate our capital needs may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition until additional sources of capital can be obtained.  Further, a deteriorating financial condition may create a negative perception of us by third parties, including investors, and financial institutions, which could impact our ability to access additional capital in the debt or equity markets.\nOur primary sources of liquidity are management fee revenue and cash flows generated from our investment portfolio.  In the event our current sources do not satisfy our liquidity needs, we have the ability to access our $100 million bank revolving line of credit, from which there were no borrowings as of December 31, 2021, or liquidate assets in our investment portfolio.  Volatility in the financial markets could limit our ability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such investments to sell at deep discounts.\nIn the event these traditional sources of liquidity are not available, we may have to seek additional financing.  Our access to funds will depend upon a number of factors including current market conditions, the availability of credit, market liquidity, and the timing of obtaining\ncredit ratings.  In deteriorating market conditions, there can be no assurance that we will obtain additional financing, or, if available, that the cost of financing will not substantially increase and affect our overall profitability."

This discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and related notes and all other items contained within this Annual Report on Form 10-K as these contain important information helpful in evaluating our financial condition and results of operations.\nINDEX\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD-LOOKING INFORMATION\n\"Safe Harbor\" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995:\nStatements contained herein that are not historical fact are forward-looking statements and, as such, are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual events and results to differ, perhaps materially, from those discussed herein.  Forward-looking statements relate to future trends, events or results and include, without limitation, statements and assumptions on which such statements are based that are related to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions, and adequacy of resources.  Examples of forward-looking statements are discussions relating to premium and investment income, expenses, operating results, and compliance with contractual and regulatory requirements.  Forward-looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties that are difficult to predict.  Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted in such forward-looking statements.  Among the risks and\n16\nuncertainties, in addition to those set forth in our filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, that could cause actual results and future events to differ from those set forth or contemplated in the forward-looking statements include the following:\n•\ndependence upon our relationship with the Erie Insurance Exchange (\"Exchange\") and the management fee under the agreement with the subscribers at the Exchange;\n•\ndependence upon our relationship with the Exchange and the growth of the Exchange, including:\n◦\ngeneral business and economic conditions;\n◦\nfactors affecting insurance industry competition;\n◦\ndependence upon the independent agency system; and\n◦\nability to maintain our reputation for customer service;\n•\ndependence upon our relationship with the Exchange and the financial condition of the Exchange, including:\n◦\nthe Exchange's ability to maintain acceptable financial strength ratings;\n◦\nfactors affecting the quality and liquidity of the Exchange's investment portfolio;\n◦\nchanges in government regulation of the insurance industry;\n◦\nlitigation and regulatory actions;\n◦\nemergence of significant unexpected events, including pandemics;\n◦\nemerging claims and coverage issues in the industry; and\n◦\nsevere weather conditions or other catastrophic losses, including terrorism;\n•\ncosts of providing policy issuance and renewal services to the Exchange under the subscriber's agreement;\n•\nability to attract and retain talented management and employees;\n•\nability to ensure system availability and effectively manage technology initiatives;\n•\ndifficulties with technology or data security breaches, including cyber attacks;\n•\nability to maintain uninterrupted business operations;\n•\noutcome of pending and potential litigation;\n•\nfactors affecting the quality and liquidity of our investment portfolio; and\n•\nour ability to meet liquidity needs and access capital.\nA forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date on which it is made and reflects our analysis only as of that date.  We undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions, or otherwise.\nRECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS\nSee Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Financial Statements\" contained within this report for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards and the impact on our financial statements.\n17\nOPERATING OVERVIEW\nOverview\nWe are a Pennsylvania business corporation that since 1925 has been the managing attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the Exchange, a reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance.  Our primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.\nThe Exchange is a reciprocal insurance exchange, which is an unincorporated association of individuals, partnerships and corporations that agree to insure one another.  Each applicant for insurance to the Exchange signs a subscriber's agreement, which contains an appointment of Indemnity as their attorney-in-fact to transact the business of the Exchange on their behalf.\nPursuant to the subscriber’s agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these two capacities, we earn a management fee.  Management fee revenue is based upon all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange and the management fee rate, which is not to exceed 25%.  Our Board of Directors establishes the management fee rate at least annually, generally in December for the following year.  The process of setting the management fee rate includes the evaluation of current year operating results compared to both prior year and industry estimated results for both Indemnity and the Exchange, and consideration of several factors for both entities including: their relative financial strength and capital position; projected revenue, expense and earnings for the subsequent year; future capital needs; as well as competitive position.  The management fee rate was set at 25% for 2021, 2020 and 2019.  Our Board of Directors set the 2022 management fee rate again at 25%, its maximum level.\nOur earnings are primarily driven by the management fee revenue generated for the services we provide to the Exchange.  The policy issuance and renewal services we provide to the Exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies.  The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services.  Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures.  Agent compensation comprised approximately 66% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately 10% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.  We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately 11% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.\nBy virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to Indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nOur results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange as the Exchange is our sole customer, and our earnings are largely generated from management fees based on the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The Exchange generates revenue by insuring preferred and standard risks, with personal lines comprising 70% of the 2021 direct and affiliated assumed written premiums and commercial lines comprising the remaining 30%.  The principal personal lines products are private passenger automobile and homeowners.  The principal commercial lines products are commercial multi-peril, commercial automobile and workers compensation.\nWe generate investment income from our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios.  Our portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  We actively evaluate the portfolios for securities in an unrealized loss position and record impairment write-downs on investments in instances where we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security.  Impairments resulting from a credit loss are recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet.\n18\nCoronavirus (\"COVID-19\") Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") was declared a global pandemic and pandemic conditions have influenced various economic factors, including a more inflationary environment in recent months.  As the uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent resulting conditions continues to evolve, the ultimate impact and duration remain uncertain at this time.  The following sections provide a summary of the more relevant financial impacts, risk monitoring activities, and operational considerations for Indemnity and the Exchange.\nThe impact the COVID-19 pandemic has on the premiums written by the Exchange, our sole customer, affects our management fee revenue.  The uncertainty of the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic will likely continue until such time as the spread of the virus is contained or reaches endemic status.  In response to reduced driving conditions in 2020 resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, the Exchange implemented $200 million in personal and commercial auto rate reductions on policies written between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021.  These rate reductions resulted in a decrease to Exchange’s written premium of approximately $110 million and $90 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, and a corresponding decrease in our management fee revenue of approximately $27.5 million and $22.5 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.  As driving activity returned to near pre-pandemic levels in 2021, increased claim frequency and severity negatively impacted Exchange’s operations and may continue to impact future premium rates.  There may also be other market and/or regulatory pressures that could impact the Exchange’s operations.  While financial markets remained generally strong in 2021, we could experience future losses and/or impairments to the portfolio due to the ongoing pandemic and inflationary pressures.  We have provided additional disclosure of these impacted areas throughout our Management’s Discussion and Analysis that follows.  A broader discussion of the potential future impacts has also been disclosed in Financial Condition and Liquidity and Capital Resources contained within this report, as well as Part I. Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report.\nFrom March of 2020 through the end of 2021 we had a dedicated internal committee comprised of management from various finance disciplines reviewing our risk positions and emerging trends on an ongoing basis as circumstances were evolving.  The committee reviewed risk scenarios and performed stress tests, including the review of cash flow trends, liquidity requirements and other forms of risk quantification.  This provided tools for management, as well as our Risk Committee of the Board of Directors, to assess risks and prioritize key issues.\nWhile we were not required to close our physical locations under the state mandated closure of nonessential services, out of concern for the health and safety of our employees, over 90% of our workforce has been working remote since March 2020.  We have had no significant interruption to our core business processes or systems to date.  We have had no significant changes to our financial close or reporting processes or related internal controls, nor do we anticipate any significant future challenges at this time.  We have a dedicated team responsible for the development and implementation of a return to office plan. We began returning some employees to our offices in July 2021, but paused as a result of the national increase in infections. We plan to resume returning employees to our offices in phases when we consider it appropriate.\n19\nFinancial Overview\nNM = not meaningful\nOperating income decreased in 2021 compared to 2020 as growth in operating expenses outpaced the growth in operating revenues.  Management fee revenue is based upon the management fee rate we charge and the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The management fee rate was 25% for 2021, 2020, and 2019.  The direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 3.3% to $7.9 billion in 2021 and 1.7% to $7.6 billion in 2020.\nCost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 5.6% to $1.7 billion in 2021 primarily due to higher commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, increased technology costs, increased administrative and other costs, and higher agent incentive compensation from profitable growth.  Cost of operations for policy issuance and renewal services increased 3.3% to $1.6 billion in 2020 primarily due to higher commissions driven by direct and affiliated assumed written premium growth, higher agent incentive compensation driven by lower automobile claims frequency experienced by the Exchange, and higher personnel costs.\nManagement fee revenue for administrative services decreased 2.0% to $58.3 million in 2021 compared to an increase of 4.0% to $59.5 million in 2020.  The administrative services reimbursement revenue and corresponding cost of operations increased both total operating revenue and total operating expenses to $638.5 million in 2021 and $609.4 million in 2020, but had no net impact on operating income.\nTotal investment income increased $34.5 million in 2021 primarily due to an increase in net investment income which was driven by favorable results in our limited partnership portfolio.  Total investment income decreased $7.1 million in 2020 primarily driven by higher impairments and lower net investment income reflecting lower interest rates due to market volatility caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\nGeneral Conditions and Trends Affecting Our Business\nEconomic conditions\nUnfavorable changes in economic conditions, including declining consumer confidence, inflation, high unemployment, and the threat of recession, among others, may lead the Exchange’s customers to modify coverage, not renew policies, or even cancel policies, which could adversely affect the premium revenue of the Exchange, and consequently our management fee.  The extent to which economic conditions could impact the Exchange’s operations and our management fee was exacerbated with the COVID-19 pandemic.  Further, pandemic conditions have created an inflationary environment in recent months.  In particular, unanticipated increased inflation costs including medical cost inflation, building material cost inflation, auto repair cost inflation, and tort issues may impact estimated loss reserves and future premium rates.  The extent and duration of the impacts to economic conditions remain uncertain as the pandemic and subsequent resulting conditions continue to evolve.  If any of these items impacted the financial condition or operations of the Exchange, it could have an impact on our financial results.  See Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources, and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report for a discussion of potential impacts to our operations or those of the Exchange, including pandemics.\nFinancial market volatility\nOur portfolio of fixed maturity and equity security investments is subject to market volatility especially in periods of instability in the worldwide financial markets.  Over time, net investment income could also be impacted by volatility and by the general level of interest rates, which impact reinvested cash flow from the portfolio and business operations.  Depending upon market conditions, which are unpredictable and remain uncertain, considerable fluctuation could exist in the fair value of our investment portfolio and reported total investment income, which could have an adverse impact on our financial condition,\n20\nresults of operations, and cash flows.  Significant volatility was seen in the global financial markets at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and pandemic related events or subsequent resulting conditions, including inflation, may create future volatility. The extent of the impact on our invested assets cannot be estimated with a high degree of certainty at this time given the ongoing developments of this pandemic and the related impacts on the financial markets.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nThe financial statements include amounts based upon estimates and assumptions that have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period and related disclosures.  We consider an accounting estimate to be critical if 1) it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, and 2) different estimates that could have been used, or changes in the estimate that are likely to occur from period-to-period, could have a material impact on our Statements of Operations or Financial Position.\nThe following presents a discussion of those accounting policies surrounding estimates that we believe are the most critical to our reported amounts and require the most subjective and complex judgment.  If actual events differ significantly from the underlying assumptions, there could be material adjustments to prior estimates that could potentially adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows. The estimates and the estimating methods used are reviewed continually, and any adjustments considered necessary are reflected in current earnings.\nInvestment Valuation\nFair Value Measurements\nWe make estimates concerning the fair value of our investments using valuation techniques to derive the fair value of the fixed maturity investments we hold.  Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants at the measurement date.\nFair value measurements are based upon observable and unobservable inputs. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect our view of market assumptions in the absence of observable market information.  We utilize valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs.  Our investments are categorized into a three-level fair value hierarchy which assigns a Level 1 for highly observable inputs and a Level 3 to unobservable inputs.  We continually assess whether or not an active market exists for all of our investments and as of each reporting date we re-evaluate their classification in the fair value hierarchy.\nAs of each reporting period, financial instruments recorded at fair value are classified based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The presence of at least one unobservable input that has significant impact to the fair value measurement would result in classification as a Level 3 instrument.  Our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement requires judgment, and considers factors specific to the asset, such as the relative impact on the fair value as a result of including a particular input and market conditions.   While estimates of the fair values of our investment portfolio are obtained from outside pricing services, we ultimately determine whether the inputs used are observable or unobservable.\nAs of December 31,2021, substantially all of the securities measured at fair value in our investment portfolio are classified as Level 2.  Level 2 securities are valued using industry-standard models that consider various inputs, such as the interest rate and credit spread for the underlying financial instruments.  All significant inputs are observable, or derived from observable information in the marketplace, or are supported by observable levels at which transactions are executed in the marketplace.  At December 31, 2021, our investments classified as Level 3 were not significant.\nSee Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 5, Fair Value, of Notes to Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on the fair value measurement of our investments.\nImpairments\nWe regularly monitor our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios for price changes and perform detailed reviews of securities in an unrealized loss position that may indicate that credit-related or other impairments exist.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we do not have significant unrealized losses and our credit-related or other impairments were not material to our financial condition or results of operations.\nSee Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 2, Significant Accounting Policies, of Notes to Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on impairments of available-for-sale securities.\n21\nRetirement Benefit Plans for Employees\nOur pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan (\"SERP\") for certain members of executive and senior management.  Although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 58% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and the Exchange's allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.\nOur pension obligation is developed from actuarial estimates.  Several statistical and other factors, which attempt to anticipate future events, are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans.  Key factors include assumptions about the discount rates and expected rates of return on plan assets.  We review these assumptions annually and modify them considering historical experience, current market conditions, including changes in investment returns and interest rates, and expected future trends.\nAccumulated and projected benefit obligations are expressed as the present value of future cash payments.  We discount those cash payments based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information with maturities that correspond to the payment of benefits.  Lower discount rates increase present values and subsequent year pension expense, while higher discount rates decrease present values and subsequent year pension expense.  The construction of the yield curve is based upon yields of corporate bonds rated AA or equivalent quality.  Target yields are developed from bonds at various maturity points and a curve is fitted to those targets.  Spot rates (zero coupon bond yields) are developed from the yield curve and used to discount benefit payment amounts associated with each future year.  The present value of plan benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows.  A single discount rate is then developed to produce the same present value.  The cash flows from the yield curve were matched against our projected benefit payments in the pension plan, which have a duration of about 19 years.  This yield curve supported the selection of a 3.16% discount rate for the projected benefit obligation at December 31, 2021 and for the 2022 pension expense.  The same methodology was used to develop the 2.96% and 3.59% discount rates used to determine the projected benefit obligation for 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the pension expense for 2021 and 2020, respectively.  A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would increase pension cost in the following year by $6.4 million, of which our share would be approximately $2.7 million, and would increase the pension benefit obligation by $59.2 million.\nUnrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors, including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets.  These unrecognized gains and losses are recorded in the pension plan obligation and accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).  These amounts are systematically recognized to net periodic pension expense in future periods, with gains decreasing and losses increasing future pension expense.  If actuarial net gains or losses exceed 5% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation and the market-related value of plan assets, the excess is recognized through the net periodic pension expense equally over the estimated service period of the employee group, which is currently 14 years.\nThe expected long-term rate of return for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  To determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon rigorous historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  The expected future return for each asset class is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls.  The expected long-term rate of return is less susceptible to annual revisions, as there are typically no significant changes in the asset mix.  Based on the current asset allocation and a review of the key factors and expectations of future asset performance, the expected return on asset assumption remained at 5.50% for 2022.  A change of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of return assumption, with other assumptions held constant, would have an estimated $2.4 million impact on net pension benefit cost in the following year, of which our share would be approximately $1.0 million.\nWe use a four-year averaging method to determine the market-related value of plan assets, which is used to determine the expected return component of pension expense.  Under this methodology, asset gains or losses that result from returns that differ from our long-term rate of return assumption are recognized in the market-related value of assets on a level basis over a four-year period.  The market-related asset experience during 2021 that related to the actual investment return being different from that assumed during the prior year was a gain of $36.7 million.  Recognition of this gain will be deferred and recognized over a four-year period, consistent with the market-related asset value methodology.  Once factored into the market-related asset value, these experience gains and losses will be amortized over a period of 14 years, which is the remaining service period of the employee group.\n22\nWe expect our net pension benefit costs to decrease from $57.1 million in 2021 to $45.9 million in 2022 primarily resulting from anticipated plan progression and liability gains due to the higher discount rate.  Our share of the net pension benefit costs after reimbursements was $24.0 million in 2021.  We expect our share of the net pension benefit costs to be approximately $19.3 million in 2022.\nThe actuarial assumptions we used in determining our pension obligation may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates, or longer or shorter life spans of participants.  While we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate, differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.  See Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 9, Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Financial Statements\" contained within this report for additional details on the pension plans.\n23\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nManagement fee revenue\nWe have two performance obligations in the subscriber’s agreement, providing policy issuance and renewal services and acting as attorney-in-fact for the Exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.  We earn management fees for acting as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange in these two capacities.  Our revenues are allocated between the two performance obligations.\nManagement fee rate\nThe management fee is calculated by multiplying all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange by the management fee rate, which is determined by our Board of Directors at least annually.  The management fee rate was set at 25%, the maximum rate, for 2021, 2020 and 2019.  Changes in the management fee rate can affect our revenue and net income significantly.  The transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services.  We update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price.  Our current transaction price allocation review resulted in a minor change in the allocation between the two performance obligations in 2021 compared to prior years, which did not have a material impact on our financial statements.\nThe following table presents the allocation and disaggregation of revenue for our two performance obligations:\nNM = not meaningful\n(1)    A constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term.  Management fees are returned to the Exchange when policies are cancelled mid-term and unearned premiums are refunded.\n(2)    Management fee revenue - administrative services is recognized over time as the services are performed. See Item 8. \"Financial Statements - Note 3, Revenue, of Notes to Financial Statements\" contained within this report.\n24\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange\nDirect and affiliated assumed premiums include premiums written directly by the Exchange and premiums assumed from its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries.  Direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange increased 3.3% to $7.9 billion in 2021, from $7.6 billion in 2020, primarily driven by increased homeowners and commercial multi-peril premiums written\n.\nYear-over-year policies in force for all lines of business increased 3.2% in 2021 as the result of continuing strong policyholder retention and an increase in new policies written, compared to 2.1% in 2020.  The year-over-year average premium per policy for all lines of business increased 0.1% at December 31, 2021, compared to a decrease of 0.4% at December 31, 2020.  The year-over-year average premium per policy at both December 31, 2021 and 2020 was impacted by the rate reductions for personal and commercial auto policies written between July 1, 2020 and June 30, 2021, in response to the lower driving activity and to provide financial relief as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nPremiums generated from new business increased 13.2% to $965 million in 2021.  New business policies written increased 9.0% in 2021 and year-over-year average premium per policy on new business increased 3.9% at December 31, 2021.  Premiums generated from new business decreased 1.2% to $852 million in 2020.  While new business policies written increased 5.0% in 2020, year-over-year average premium per policy on new business decreased 5.9% at December 31, 2020.\nPremiums generated from renewal business increased 2.1% to $6.9 billion in 2021, compared to 2.1%, or $6.8 billion, in 2020.  Underlying the trend in renewal business premiums was steady policy retention ratios, partially offset by a 0.3% decrease in year-over-year average premium per policy at December 31, 2021, compared to an increase of 0.4% at December 31, 2020.\nThe Exchange implements rate changes in order to meet loss cost expectations.  As the Exchange writes policies with annual terms only, rate actions take 12 months to be fully recognized in written premium and 24 months to be recognized in earned premiums.  Since rate changes are realized at renewal, it takes 12 months to implement a rate change to all policyholders and another 12 months to earn the increased or decreased premiums in full.  As a result, certain rate changes approved in 2020, including those in response to reduced driving conditions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, were reflected in 2021, and a portion of the rate actions in 2021 will be reflected in 2022.  The Exchange continuously evaluates pricing and product offerings to meet consumer demands.\nPersonal lines\n– Total personal lines premiums written increased 2.5% to $5.5 billion in 2021, from $5.4 billion in 2020, driven by an increase in total personal lines policies in force of 3.1%. Total personal lines year-over-year average premium per policy decreased 0.6% at December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, driven by personal auto rate reductions.  Total personal lines policies in force increased 2.2% in 2020 and year-over-year average premium per policy decreased 0.8% at December 31, 2020.\nCommercial lines\n– Total commercial lines premiums written increased 5.4% to $2.4 billion in 2021, compared to 2020, driven by a 3.6% increase in total commercial lines policies in force and a 1.7% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy. Total commercial lines premiums written increased 2.6% in 2020, compared to 2019, driven by a 1.6% increase in total commercial lines policies in force and a 0.9% increase in the total commercial lines year-over-year average premium per policy.\nFuture trends-premium revenue\n– Through a careful agency selection process, the Exchange plans to continue its effort to expand the size of its agency force to increase market penetration in existing operating territories to contribute to future growth.\nChanges in premium levels attributable to the growth in policies in force directly affect the profitability of the Exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  Our continued focus on underwriting discipline and the maturing of pricing sophistication models have contributed to the Exchange's steady policy retention ratios.  The continued growth of its policy base is dependent upon the Exchange's ability to retain existing and attract new subscribers/policyholders.  A lack of new policy growth or the inability to retain existing customers could have an adverse effect on the Exchange's premium level growth, and consequently our management fee.\nChanges in premium levels attributable to rate changes also directly affect the profitability of the Exchange and have a direct bearing on our management fee.  Pricing actions contemplated or taken by the Exchange are subject to various regulatory requirements of the states in which it operates.  The pricing actions already implemented, or to be implemented, have an effect on the market competitiveness of the Exchange's insurance products.  Such pricing actions, and those of the Exchange's competitors, could affect the ability of the Exchange's agents to retain and attract new business; additionally, exposure reductions and/or changes in mix of business as a result of economic conditions due to the COVID-19 pandemic or other significant unexpected events could impact the average premium written and affiliated assumed by the Exchange, as customers may reduce coverages.  Future premiums could also be impacted by potential regulatory changes resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.  Longer-term, increased driving activity may result in increased future rates due to higher claims and severity. We expect the Exchange's pricing actions to result in a net increase in direct written premium in 2022; however, the extent of the impact to the Exchange's premiums and our management fee cannot be estimated with a high degree of certainty at this time given the ongoing developments related to this pandemic and current inflationary trends.  See also Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report.\n25\nPolicy issuance and renewal services\nPolicy issuance and renewal services\nWe allocate a portion of the management fee, which currently equates to 24.3% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, for providing policy issuance and renewal services.  The allocation of management fee for these services was 24.2% in both 2020 and 2019.  This portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue when the policy is issued or renewed because it is at that time that the services we provide are substantially complete and the executed insurance policy is transferred to the customer.  The increase in management fee revenue for policy issuance and renewal services was driven by the increase in the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange discussed previously.\nService agreement revenue\nService agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from subscribers/policyholders for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the Exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees.  The service charges are fixed dollar amounts per billed installment.  The decrease in service agreement revenue reflects the continued shift to payment plans that do not incur service charges or offer a premium discount for certain payment methods.\nCost of policy issuance and renewal services\nCommissions\n– Commissions increased $57.2 million in 2021 compared to 2020 resulting from higher direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, primarily in lines of business that pay a higher commission rate.  To a lesser extent, there was also an increase in agent incentive compensation in 2021 compared to 2020 related to profitable growth.  Commissions increased $26.6 million in 2020 compared to 2019 resulting from higher direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange and higher agent incentive compensation.  The Exchange experienced a significant decrease in automobile claims frequency and related loss expense beginning March 2020 that continued through May 2020 driven by the COVID-19 pandemic, which contributed to an increase in the profitability component of the agent incentive bonuses.\n26\nNon-commission expense\n– Non-commission expense increased $31.3 million in 2021 compared to 2020.  Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $4.5 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs.  Information technology costs increased $11.3 million primarily due to increased hardware and software costs and personnel costs.  Administrative and other expenses increased $14.2 million primarily due to increased professional fees and building and equipment depreciation.  Personnel costs in all categories were impacted by higher medical costs compared to the prior year as the COVID-19 pandemic reduced elective procedures in 2020.\nIn 2020, non-commission expense increased $24.3 million compared to 2019.  Underwriting and policy processing costs increased $5.7 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and underwriting report costs.  Information technology costs increased $6.2 million primarily due to increased personnel costs and hardware and software costs.  Administrative and other expenses increased $9.3 million primarily driven by increased personnel costs.  Increased personnel costs in all categories included higher incentive plan award accruals related to underwriting performance in 2020 compared to targets and higher vacation accruals as employees took less vacation in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAdministrative services\nAdministrative services\nWe allocate a portion of the management fee, which currently equates to 0.7% of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, to the administrative services.  The allocation of management fee for these services was 0.8% in both 2020 and 2019.  This portion of the management fee is recognized as revenue over a four-year period representing the time over which the services are provided.  We also report reimbursed costs as revenues, which are recognized monthly as services are provided.  The administrative services expenses we incur and the related reimbursements we receive are recorded gross in the Statements of Operations.\nCost of administrative services\nBy virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services in accordance with the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to Indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements.  We record these reimbursements due from the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries as a receivable.\n27\nTotal investment income\nA summary of the results of our investment operations is as follows for the years ended December 31:\nNM = not meaningful\nNet investment income\nNet investment income includes interest and dividends on our fixed maturity and equity security portfolios and the results of our limited partnership investments, net of investment expenses.  Net investment income increased by $32.4 million in 2021, compared to 2020, primarily due to equity in earnings of limited partnerships of $31.7 million in 2021 compared to equity in losses of limited partnerships of $0.6 million in 2020.  Net investment income decreased by $4.3 million in 2020, compared to 2019, primarily due to decreased income from cash and cash equivalents driven by lower rates and invested balances, somewhat offset by increased preferred stock income resulting from higher invested balances.\nNet realized and unrealized investment gains (losses)\nA breakdown of our net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) is as follows for the years ended December 31:\nNet realized and unrealized gains of $4.9 million in 2021 were primarily due to disposals of available-for-sale securities.  Net realized and unrealized gains of $6.4 million in 2020 were primarily due to market value adjustments on equity securities and from the sale of available-for-sale securities, while gains of $6.1 million in 2019 were primarily due to sales of available-for-sale securities and increases in fair value of equity securities.\nNet impairment recoveries (losses) recognized in earnings\nNet impairment recoveries of $0.2 million in 2021 were primarily a result of the change in the current expected credit loss allowance related to our agent loans.  Net impairment losses recognized on available-for-sale securities in 2020 include $2.3 million of securities in an unrealized loss position where we had intent to sell prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and $0.7 million of credit impairment losses.  The remaining 2020 impairments include the change in the current expected credit loss allowance related to our agent loans.  The COVID-19 pandemic's impact on financial markets contributed to higher impairment losses on our available-for-sale securities during 2020 compared to other years presented.  Net impairment losses recognized in 2019 included securities in an unrealized loss position that we intended to sell prior to expected recovery of our amortized cost basis as well as securities in an unrealized loss position where we determined the loss was other-than-temporary based on credit factors.\n28\nFinancial Condition of Erie Insurance Exchange\nServing in the capacity of attorney-in-fact for the Exchange, we are dependent on the growth and financial condition of the Exchange, who is our sole customer.  The strength of the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries is rated annually by A.M. Best Company through assessing its financial stability and ability to pay claims.  The ratings are generally based upon factors relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward return to investors.  The Exchange and each of its property and casualty subsidiaries are rated A+ \"Superior\", the second highest financial strength rating, which is assigned to companies that have achieved superior overall performance when compared to the standards established by A.M. Best and have a superior ability to meet obligations to policyholders over the long term.  On July 27, 2021, the outlook for the financial strength rating was affirmed as stable.  As of December 31, 2021, only approximately 12% of insurance groups, in which the Exchange is included, are rated A+ or higher.\nThe financial statements of the Exchange are prepared in accordance with statutory accounting principles prescribed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.  Financial statements prepared under statutory accounting principles focus on the solvency of the insurer and generally provide a more conservative approach than under U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.  Statutory direct written premiums of the Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries grew 3.3% to $7.9 billion in 2021 from $7.6 billion in 2020.  These premiums, along with investment income, are the major sources of cash that support the operations of the Exchange.  Policyholders' surplus, determined under statutory accounting principles, was $11.7 billion and $10.7 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The Exchange and its wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries' year-over-year policy retention ratio continues to be high at 90.1% at December 31, 2021 and 89.9% at December 31, 2020.\nWe have prepared our financial statements considering the financial strength of the Exchange based on its A.M. Best rating and strong level of surplus.  We are monitoring risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic on an ongoing basis and believe that the Exchange falls within established risk tolerances.  However, see Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" for possible outcomes that could impact that determination.\n29\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio is managed with the objective of maximizing after-tax returns on a risk-adjusted basis.  The following table presents the carrying value of our investments as of December 31:\n(1)\nThe current portion of agent loans is included with prepaid expenses and other current assets in the Statements of Financial Position.\nWe continually review our investment portfolio for impairment and determine whether the impairment is a result of credit loss or other factors.  We individually analyze all positions with an emphasis on those in a significant unrealized loss position.  If we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings.  Factors considered in the evaluation of credit loss include the extent to which fair value is less than cost and fundamental factors specific to the issuer such as financial condition, changes in credit ratings, near and long-term business prospects and other factors, as well as the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost of the security.  Impairment resulting from credit loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet.  We believe our investment valuation philosophy and accounting practices result in appropriate and timely measurement of fair value and recognition of impairment.\nFixed maturities\nUnder our investment strategy, we maintain a fixed maturity portfolio that is of high quality and well diversified within each market sector. This investment strategy also achieves a balanced maturity schedule.  Our fixed maturity portfolio is managed with the goal of achieving reasonable returns while limiting exposure to risk.\nFixed maturities are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses, net of deferred taxes, included in shareholders' equity.  Net unrealized gains on fixed maturities, net of deferred taxes, totaled $6.2 million at December 31, 2021, compared to net unrealized gains of $23.3 million at December 31, 2020.\nThe following table presents a breakdown of the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio by industry sector and rating as of December 31, 2021:\n(1)\n(1)\nRatings are supplied by S&P, Moody’s, and Fitch. The table is based upon the lowest rating for each security.\n(2)    Structured securities include residential and commercial mortgage-backed securities, collateralized debt obligations, and asset-backed securities.\n30\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities primarily include nonredeemable preferred stocks and are carried at fair value in the Statements of Financial Position with all changes in unrealized gains and losses reflected in the Statements of Operations.\nThe following table presents an analysis of the fair value of our equity securities by sector as of December 31:\nShareholders' Equity\nPostretirement benefit plans\nThe funded status of our postretirement benefit plans is recognized in the Statements of Financial Position, with a corresponding adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), net of tax.  At December 31, 2021, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $70.0 million, net of tax, of which $13.9 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $56.1 million represents the current period actuarial gain.  The 2021 actuarial gain was primarily due to higher than expected returns on plan assets.  At December 31, 2020, shareholders' equity amounts related to these postretirement plans increased by $20.0 million, net of tax, of which $10.6 million represents amortization of the prior service cost and net actuarial loss and $9.4 million of current period actuarial gain.  The 2020 actuarial gain was driven by higher than expected returns on assets which exceeded losses incurred as a result of the lower discount rate in 2020.  Although we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately 58% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which includes pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and their allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.\n31\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nWe continue to monitor the sufficiency of our liquidity and capital resources given the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent resulting conditions, including inflationary costs.  While we did not see a significant impact on our sources or uses of cash in 2021, future disruptions in the markets could occur which may affect our liquidity position.  If our normal operating and investing cash activities were to become insufficient to meet future funding requirements, we believe we have sufficient access to liquidity through our cash position, liquid marketable securities and our $100 million line of credit that does not expire until October 2026.  See broader discussions of potential risks to our operations in the Operating Overview and Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained within this report.\nSources and Uses of Cash\nLiquidity is a measure of a company's ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the short- and long-term cash requirements of its business operations and growth needs.  Our liquidity requirements have been met primarily by funds generated from management fee revenue and income from investments.  Cash provided from these sources is used primarily to fund the costs of our management operations including commissions, salaries and wages, pension plans, share repurchases, dividends to shareholders, the purchase and development of information technology, and other capital expenditures.  We expect that our operating cash needs will be met by funds generated from operations.  Cash in excess of our operating needs is primarily invested in investment grade fixed maturities.  As part of our liquidity review, we regularly evaluate our capital needs based on current and projected results and consider the potential impacts to our liquidity, borrowing capacity, financial covenants and capital availability.\nWe have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under various agreements.  Cash requirements within the next twelve months include accounts payable and accrued liabilities, the current portion of long-term borrowings, and other current obligations.\nOur long-term cash requirements under various contractual obligations and commitments include:\n•\nDebt and interest payments\n– See Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 8. Borrowing Arrangements, of Notes to Financial Statements\" for details of our obligations and the timing of expected future payments.\n•\nPension\n– We have a funded noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan (\"SERP\") for certain members of executive senior management.  See Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 9. Postretirement Benefits, of Notes to Financial Statements\" for the funding policy for our defined benefit pension plan and accumulated benefit obligation for our unfunded SERP.\n•\nDeferred compensation –\nWe have two deferred compensation plans for our executives, senior vice presidents, and other selected officers and two deferred compensation plans for our outside directors.  See Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data – Note 10. Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plans, of Notes to Financial Statements\" for additional details of these obligations and estimated future payments.\n•\nOther commitments\n– We have commitments for approximately $424 million which include agreements for various services, including information technology, support, and maintenance obligations, operating leases for equipment, vehicles, and real estate, and other obligations in the ordinary course of business.  We expect to make future cash payments according to the contract terms.  These agreements are enforceable and legally binding and specify fixed amounts or minimum quantities to be purchased. Some agreements may contain cancellation provisions, some of which may require us to pay a termination fee.  Over half of these commitments are due in the next 12 months.  We are reimbursed from the Exchange and its subsidiaries for the portion of these costs related to administrative services.\nWe believe that our current cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our current and future cash requirements.\nVolatility in the financial markets presents challenges to us as we do occasionally access our investment portfolio as a source of cash.  Some of our fixed income investments, despite being publicly traded, may be illiquid.  Volatility in these markets could impair our ability to sell certain of our fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our needs from sources other than the liquidation of securities.\n32\nCash flow activities\nThe following table provides condensed cash flow information for the years ended December 31:\nNet cash provided by operating activities was $402.8 million in 2021, compared to $342.6 million in 2020 and $364.5 million in 2019.  Increased cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was primarily due to an increase in management fees received driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange of $94.6 million and an increase in administrative service reimbursements received of $46.9 million.  Partially offsetting the increase in cash provided by operating activities was an increase in cash paid for agent commissions of $37.4 million due to higher scheduled commission driven by premium growth, an increase in administrative services expenses paid of $33.8 million and an increase in agent bonuses of $15.4 million, compared to 2020.  Decreased cash provided by operating activities in 2020 was primarily due to an increase in cash paid for agent commissions of $33.3 million due to higher scheduled commissions driven by premium growth, increased general operating expenses paid of $17.4 million and increased administrative services expenses paid of $16.2 million.  Offsetting the decrease in cash provided by operating activities was an increase of $42.5 million in management fee received driven by growth in direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange, compared to 2019.\nNet cash used in investing activities totaled $185.5 million in 2021, compared to $243.2 million in 2020 and $124.6 million in 2019.  In 2021, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by fixed asset purchases of $148.8 million, which included the purchase of the home office from the Exchange.  To a lesser extent, purchases of investments exceeded proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments.  In 2020, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by purchases of investments exceeding proceeds generated from sales and maturities/calls of investments.  In 2019, net cash used in investing activities was primarily driven by fixed asset purchases of $102.0 million primarily related to the new home office building which was funded primarily by the senior secured draw term loan facility.\nNet cash used in financing activities totaled $194.8 million in 2021, compared to $274.9 million in 2020 and $169.6 million in 2019.  The decrease in cash used in 2021, compared to 2020, was due to a decrease in dividends paid to shareholders by $80.1 million, compared to 2020.  The increase in cash used in 2020, compared to 2019, was due to an increase in dividends paid to shareholders.  In addition to the normal quarterly dividends paid in 2020, the Board also declared a special one-time cash dividend of $2.00 on each Class A share and $300 on each Class B share totaling $93.1 million, which was paid in December 2020.\nNo shares of our Class A nonvoting common stock were repurchased in 2021, 2020 and 2019 in conjunction with our stock repurchase program.  In 2011, our Board of Directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program for a total of $150 million with no time limitation.  This repurchase authority includes, and is not in addition to, any unspent amounts remaining under the prior authorization.  We had approximately $17.8 million of repurchase authority remaining under this program at December 31, 2021, based upon trade date.\nWe purchase shares of our outstanding Class A nonvoting common stock outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program for certain stock-based incentive plans.  We purchased 26,667 shares for $5.3 million in 2021, 31,248 shares for $5.8 million in 2020 and 15,003 shares for $2.6 million in 2019 to settle awards for our equity compensation plan and to fund the rabbi trust for the outside director deferred stock compensation plan and the incentive compensation deferral plan.  All shares were delivered in the year they were purchased.\nCapital Outlook\nWe regularly prepare forecasts evaluating the current and future cash requirements for both normal and extreme risk events, including the current COVID-19 pandemic.  Should an extreme risk event result in a cash requirement exceeding normal cash flows, we have the ability to meet our future funding requirements through various alternatives available to us.\nOutside of our normal operating and investing cash activities, future funding requirements could be met through:  1) cash and cash equivalents, which total approximately $183.7 million at December 31, 2021, 2) a $100 million bank revolving line of credit, and 3) liquidation of unpledged assets held in our investment portfolio, including equity securities and investment grade bonds which totaled approximately $658.8 million at December 31, 2021.  Volatility in the financial markets could impair our\n33\nability to sell certain fixed income securities or cause such securities to sell at deep discounts.  Additionally, we have the ability to curtail or modify discretionary cash outlays such as those related to shareholder dividends and share repurchase activities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have access to a $100 million bank revolving line of credit with a $25 million letter of credit sublimit that expires on October 29, 2026.  As of December 31, 2021, a total of $99.1 million remains available under the facility due to $0.9 million outstanding letters of credit, which reduce the availability for letters of credit to $24.1 million.  We had no borrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of December 31, 2021.  Investments with a fair value of $120.9 million were pledged as collateral on the line at December 31, 2021.  These securities have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale securities and cash and cash equivalents in the Statements of Financial Position.  The bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and debt restrictions.  We were in compliance with our bank covenants at December 31, 2021.\nEnterprise Risk Management\nThe role of our Enterprise Risk Management (\"ERM\") function is to ensure that all significant risks are clearly identified, understood, proactively managed and consistently monitored to achieve strategic objectives for all stakeholders.  Our ERM program views risk holistically across our entire group of companies.  It ensures implementation of risk responses to mitigate potential impacts.  See Part I, Item 1A. \"Risk Factors\" contained in this report for a list of risk factors.\nOur ERM process is founded on a governance framework that includes oversight at multiple levels of our organization, including our Board of Directors and executive management.  Accountability to identify, manage, and mitigate risk is embedded within all functions and areas of our business.  We have defined risk tolerances to monitor and manage significant risks within acceptable levels.  In addition to identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, monitoring, and mitigating significant risks, our ERM process includes extreme event analyses and scenario testing.  Given our defined tolerance for risk, risk model output is used to quantify the potential variability of future performance and the sufficiency of capital and liquidity levels.\n34\nTRANSACTIONS/AGREEMENTS WITH RELATED PARTIES\nBoard Oversight\nOur Board of Directors has a broad oversight responsibility over our intercompany relationships with the Exchange.  As a consequence, our Board of Directors may be required to make decisions or take actions that may not be solely in the interest of our shareholders, such as setting the management fee rate paid by the Exchange to us and ratifying any other significant activity.\nInsurance Holding Company System\nMost states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as two or more affiliated persons, one or more of which is an insurer.  The Exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries:  Erie Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Company of New York, Erie Insurance Property & Casualty Company and Flagship City Insurance Company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, Erie Family Life Insurance Company.  Indemnity and the Exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.\nAll transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  Approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.\nIntercompany Agreements\nSubscriber's and services agreements\nWe serve as attorney-in-fact for the subscribers at the Exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  Each applicant for insurance to a reciprocal insurance exchange signs a subscriber's agreement that contains an appointment of an attorney-in-fact.  Through the designation of attorney-in-fact, we are required to provide policy issuance and renewal services and act as the attorney-in-fact for the Exchange with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  Pursuant to the subscriber's agreement, we earn a management fee for these services calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  By virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through the attorney-in-fact.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for all administrative services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  The amounts incurred for all administrative services are reimbursed to Indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements.  These reimbursements are settled on a monthly basis.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nShared Facilities\nWe previously leased the home office from the Exchange.  Rent was based on rental rates of like property in Erie, Pennsylvania and all operating expenses including utilities, cleaning, repairs, real estate taxes, property insurance, and leasehold improvements were the responsibility of the tenant (Indemnity).  Rental costs of shared facilities under this lease were allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied.  On December 31, 2021, we purchased the home office from the Exchange.  See Part II, Item 8. \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data - Note 14. Related Party, of Notes to Financial Statements\" for additional details.\nEffective July 1, 2021, the Exchange and its subsidiaries entered into a contractual agreement with Indemnity to use space in Indemnity-owned properties.  The amount charged is based on rates of like property in Erie, Pennsylvania and the usage or square footage occupied.  Operating expenses including utilities, cleaning, repairs, real estate taxes, property insurance and leasehold improvements are allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied.  The home office was added to this agreement effective January 1, 2022.\nCost Allocation\nThe allocation of costs affects our financial condition and that of the Exchange and its wholly owned subsidiaries.  Management's role is to determine that allocations are consistently made in accordance with the subscriber's agreement with the subscribers at the Exchange, intercompany service agreements, and applicable insurance laws and regulations.  Allocation of costs under these various agreements requires judgment and interpretation, and such allocations are performed using a consistent methodology, which is intended to adhere to the terms and intentions of the underlying agreements.\nIntercompany Receivables\nWe have significant receivables from the Exchange and its affiliates that result in a concentration of credit risk.  Net receivables from the Exchange and other affiliates were $479.1 million, or 21.4% of total assets, at December 31, 2021 and $494.6 million, or 23.4% of total assets, at December 31, 2020.  These receivables include management fees due for policy issuance and\n35\nrenewal services performed by us under the subscriber's agreement, and certain costs we incur acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries with respect to all administrative services, as discussed previously.  These receivables from the Exchange and its affiliates are settled monthly.  We continually monitor the financial strength of the Exchange."

    "text": "The significant volatility in the financial markets and uncertainty resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the pandemic’s ultimate impact and duration remain uncertain.  We could experience future losses and/or impairments to the portfolio given the pandemic’s impact on market conditions.\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, or foreign exchange rates, as well as other relevant market rate or price changes.  The volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the underlying assets are traded directly influence market risk.  The following is a discussion of our primary risk exposures, including interest rate risk, investment credit risk, concentration risk, liquidity risk, and equity price risk, and how those exposures are currently managed as of December 31, 2021.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe invest primarily in fixed maturity investments, which comprised 83% of our invested assets at December 31, 2021.  The value of the fixed maturity portfolio is subject to interest rate risk.  As market interest rates decrease, the value of the portfolio increases with the opposite holding true in rising interest rate environments.  We do not hedge our exposure to interest rate risk.  A common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity assets is effective duration, a calculation that utilizes maturity, coupon rate, yield, and call terms to calculate an expected change in fair value given a change in interest rates.  The longer the duration, the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations.  Duration is analyzed quarterly to ensure that it remains in the targeted range.\nA sensitivity analysis is used to measure the potential loss in future earnings, fair values, or cash flows of interest-sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period.  The following pro forma information is presented assuming a 100-basis point parallel increase in interest rates across the yield curve at December 31 of each year and reflects the estimated effect on the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio.\nFixed maturities interest-rate sensitivity analysis\n36\nWhile the fixed maturity portfolio is sensitive to interest rates, the future principal cash flows that will be received by contractual maturity date are presented below at December 31, 2021 and 2020.  Actual cash flows may differ from those stated as a result of calls, prepayments, or defaults.\nContractual repayments of principal by maturity date\nInvestment Credit Risk\nOur objective is to earn competitive returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of securities.  Our portfolios of fixed maturity securities, equity securities and, to a lesser extent, short-term investments are subject to credit risk.  This risk is defined as the potential loss in fair value resulting from adverse changes in the borrower's ability to repay the debt.  We manage this risk by performing upfront underwriting analysis and ongoing reviews of credit quality by position and for the portfolio in total.  We do not hedge the credit risk inherent in our fixed maturity and equity securities investments.\nGenerally, the fixed maturities in our portfolio are rated by external rating agencies.  If not externally rated, we rate them internally on a basis consistent with that used by the rating agencies.  We classify all fixed maturities as available-for-sale securities, allowing us to meet our liquidity needs and provide greater flexibility to appropriately respond to changes in market conditions.\n37\nThe following tables show our fixed maturity investments by rating\n(1)\n:\n(1)\nRatings are supplied by S&P, Moody's, and Fitch. The table is based upon the lowest rating for each security.\nWe are also exposed to a concentration of credit risk with the Exchange.  See the \"Transactions/Agreements with Related Parties, Intercompany Receivables\" section of Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained within this report for further discussion of this risk.\nConcentration Risk\nWhile our portfolio is well diversified within each market sector, there is an inherent risk of concentration in a particular industry or sector.  We continually monitor our level of exposure to individual issuers as well as our allocation to each industry and market sector against internally established policies.  See the \"Financial Condition\" section of Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" contained within this report for details of investment holdings by sector.\nLiquidity Risk\nPeriods of volatility in the financial markets can create conditions where fixed maturity investments, despite being publicly traded, can become illiquid.  However, we actively manage the maturity profile of our fixed maturity portfolio such that scheduled repayments of principal occur on a regular basis.\nEquity Price Risk\nOur portfolio of equity securities, which primarily includes nonredeemable preferred stock, is carried on the Statements of Financial Position at estimated fair value.  Equity securities are exposed to the risk of potential loss in estimated fair value resulting from an adverse change in prices (\"price risk\").  We do not hedge our exposure to price risk inherent in our equity investments.\n38"

    "text": "INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and Board of Directors of Erie Indemnity Company\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying statements of financial position of Erie Indemnity Company (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “financial statements”). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures include examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\n39\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments.

See Note 17, \"Supplementary Data on Cash Flows\", for additional supplemental cash flow information.\n45\nERIE INDEMNITY COMPANY\nNOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNote 1.\nNature of Operations\nErie Indemnity Company (\"Indemnity\", \"we\", \"us\", \"our\") is a publicly held Pennsylvania business corporation that has since its incorporation in 1925 served as the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the Erie Insurance Exchange (\"Exchange\").  The Exchange, which also commenced business in 1925, is a Pennsylvania-domiciled reciprocal insurer that writes property and casualty insurance.\nOur primary function as attorney-in-fact is to perform policy issuance and renewal services on behalf of the subscribers at the Exchange.  We also act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to all claims handling and investment management services, as well as the service provider for all claims handling, life insurance, and investment management services for its insurance subsidiaries, collectively referred to as \"administrative services\".  Acting as attorney-in-fact in these\ntwo\ncapacities is done in accordance with a subscriber's agreement (a limited power of attorney) executed individually by each subscriber (policyholder), which appoints us as their common attorney-in-fact to transact certain business on their behalf.  Pursuant to the subscriber's agreement for acting as attorney-in-fact in these\ntwo\ncapacities, we earn a management fee calculated as a percentage of the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.\nThe policy issuance and renewal services we provide to the Exchange are related to the sales, underwriting and issuance of policies.  The sales related services we provide include agent compensation and certain sales and advertising support services.  Agent compensation includes scheduled commissions to agents based upon premiums written as well as additional commissions and bonuses to agents, which are earned by achieving targeted measures.  Agent compensation comprised approximately\n66\n% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The underwriting services we provide include underwriting and policy processing and comprised approximately\n10\n% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  The remaining services we provide include customer service and administrative support.  We also provide information technology services that support all the functions listed above that comprised approximately\n11\n% of our 2021 policy issuance and renewal expenses.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these policy issuance and renewal functions.\nBy virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to Indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nOur results of operations are tied to the growth and financial condition of the Exchange.  If any events occurred that impaired the Exchange’s ability to grow or sustain its financial condition, including but not limited to reduced financial strength ratings, disruption in the independent agency relationships, significant catastrophe losses, or products not meeting customer demands, the Exchange could find it more difficult to retain its existing business and attract new business.  A decline in the business of the Exchange almost certainly would have as a consequence a decline in the total premiums paid and a correspondingly adverse effect on the amount of the management fees we receive.  We also have an exposure to a concentration of credit risk related to the unsecured receivables due from the Exchange for its management fee and cost reimbursements.  See Note 15, \"Concentrations of Credit Risk\".\nCoronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic\nIn March 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") was declared a global pandemic and pandemic conditions have created an inflationary environment which may impact estimated loss reserves and future premium rates of the Exchange.  The uncertainty resulting from COVID-19 and subsequent resulting conditions continues to evolve and the ultimate impact and duration remain uncertain at this time.  We are unable to predict the duration or extent of the business disruption or the financial impact given the ongoing development of the pandemic and its impacts on the economy and financial markets.\n46\nNote 2.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nBasis of presentation\nThe accompanying financial statements have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\").\nUse of estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.  Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRecently adopted accounting standards\nWe adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-13,\n\"Financial Instruments-Credit Losses\"\nwhich applies to our receivable from Erie Insurance Exchange and affiliates, agent loans, and investments, on January 1, 2020.  The guidance requires financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected through the use of a new forward-looking current expected credit loss model and credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses.\nFor assets measured at amortized cost for which a current expected credit loss allowance was required, we adopted the guidance using the modified-retrospective approach.  At January 1, 2020, we recorded current expected credit loss allowances related to agent loans of $\n0.8\nmillion and receivables from Erie Insurance Exchange and affiliates of $\n0.6\nmillion.  This resulted in the recording of a cumulative effect adjustment, net of taxes, to retained earnings of $\n1.1\nmillion.  Our available-for-sale investments are not measured at amortized cost, and therefore do not require the use of a current expected credit loss model.  Any credit losses, however, are required to be recorded as an allowance for credit losses rather than a reduction of the carrying value of the asset.  For available-for-sale securities, we adopted the guidance using the prospective approach and recorded an initial allowance for credit losses of $\n0.6\nmillion at March 31, 2020.\nCash and cash equivalents\n– Cash, money market accounts and other short-term, highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase, are considered cash and cash equivalents.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale securities\n– Fixed maturity debt securities and redeemable preferred stock are classified as available-for-sale and reported at fair value with unrealized investment gains and losses, net of income taxes, recognized in other comprehensive income.  Available-for-sale securities with a remaining maturity of 12 months or less and any security that we intend to sell as of the reporting date are classified as current assets.\nAvailable-for-sale securities in an unrealized loss position are evaluated to determine whether the impairment is a result of credit loss or other factors.  If we have the intent to sell or it's more likely than not that we would be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings.  Securities that have experienced a decline in fair value that we do not intend to sell, and that we will not be required to sell before recovery, are evaluated to determine if the decline in fair value is credit related.  Impairment resulting from a credit loss is recognized in earnings with a corresponding allowance on the balance sheet.  Future recoveries of credit loss result in an adjustment to the allowance and earnings in the period the credit conditions improve.  Factors considered in the evaluation of credit loss include the extent to which fair value is less than cost and fundamental factors specific to the issuer such as financial condition, changes in credit ratings, near and long-term business prospects and other factors, as well as the likelihood of recovery of the amortized cost of the security.  If the qualitative review indicates credit impairment, the allowance for credit loss is measured as the amount that the security’s amortized cost exceeds the present value of cash flows expected to be collected and is limited to the amount that fair value is below amortized cost.\nEquity securities\n– Equity securities primarily include non-redeemable preferred stocks and are reported at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses).  Securities that we intend to sell as of the reporting date are classified as current assets.\nRealized gains and losses and investment income\n–\nRealized gains and losses on sales of available-for-sale and equity securities are recognized in income based upon the specific identification method and reported in net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses).  Interest income is recognized as earned and includes amortization of premium and accretion of discount.  Income is recognized based on the constant effective yield method, which includes periodically updated prepayment assumptions obtained from third party data sources on our prepaying securities.  The effective yield for prepaying securities is\n47\nrecalculated on a retrospective basis.  Dividend income is recognized at the ex-dividend date.  Interest and dividend income and the results of our limited partnership investments are reported as net investment income.  We do not record an allowance for credit losses on accrued investment income as any amount deemed uncollectible is reversed from interest income in the period the expected payment defaults.\nDeferred taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts in the financial statements, using the statutory tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to settle or be realized.  The effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date under the law.  The need for valuation allowances on deferred tax assets are estimated based upon our assessment of the realizability of such amounts.\nFixed assets\nFixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization.  Fixed assets are primarily comprised of software, which includes internally used capitalized software and development costs, as well as building and building improvements, equipment, furniture and fixtures, and leasehold improvements.  Assets in use are depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their economic useful life or the lease term.  Software is depreciated over periods ranging from\n3\n-\n7\nyears, buildings and building improvements are depreciated over\n20\n-\n45\nyears, equipment is depreciated over\n3\n-\n10\nyears, and furniture and fixtures are depreciated over\n7\nyears.  We review long-lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  Under these circumstances, if the fair value were less than the carrying amount of the asset, we would recognize a loss for the difference.  We capitalize applicable interest charges incurred during the construction period of significant long-term building projects as part of the historical cost of the asset.\nAgent loans\nAgent loans, the majority of which are senior secured, are carried at unpaid principal balance net of a current expected credit loss allowance with interest recorded in investment income as earned.  The allowance is estimated using available loss history and/or external loss rates based on comparable loan losses and considers current conditions and forecasted information.  Changes to the allowance are recognized in earnings as adjustments to net impairment losses.  The current portion of agent loans is recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets.\nOther assets\nOther assets primarily include limited partnership investments which are recorded using the equity method of accounting.  Other assets also include operating lease assets and other long-term prepaid assets.\nAgent bonus liability\nOur more significant agent bonus plan is based upon an individual agency's property and casualty underwriting profitability and also includes a component for growth in agency property and casualty premiums if the agency's underwriting profitability targets for the book of business are met.  The estimated liability for this agent bonus plan is based upon the performance over\n36\nmonths, and is modeled on a monthly basis using actual underwriting results for the\ntwo\nprior years and current year-to-date actual results and forecasted results for the remainder of the year.  Our second agent bonus plan is based on an agency's\none-year\nunderwriting profitability and uses a similar model but considers actual and forecasted results for a calendar year only.  At December 31 of each year, we use actual data available and record an accrual based upon the expected payment amount.  These costs are included in cost of operations - policy issuance and renewal services.\nRecognition of management fee revenue\nWe earn management fees from the Exchange under the subscriber’s agreement for services provided.  Pursuant to the subscriber’s agreement, we may retain up to\n25\n% of all direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  The management fee rate is set at least annually by our Board of Directors.  The management fee revenue is calculated by multiplying the management fee rate by the direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange and is allocated between the\ntwo\nperformance obligations we have under the subscriber's agreement.  The first performance obligation is to provide policy issuance and renewal services.  The second performance obligation is acting as the attorney-in-fact with respect to the administrative services.\nManagement fee revenue allocated to the policy issuance and renewal services is recognized at the time of policy issuance or renewal, because it is at the time of policy issuance or renewal when the economic benefit of the service we provide (the substantially completed policy issuance or renewal service) and the control of the promised asset (the executed insurance policy) transfers to the customer.\n48\nManagement fee revenue allocated to the second performance obligation relates to us acting as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to the administrative services and is recognized over a\nfour-year\nperiod representing the time over which the economic benefit of the services provided (i.e. management of the administrative services) transfers to the customer.\nAdministrative services\nBy virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, the Exchange does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services in accordance with the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Claims handling services include costs incurred in the claims process, including the adjustment, investigation, defense, recording and payment functions.  Life insurance management services include costs incurred in the management and processing of life insurance business.  Investment management services are related to investment trading activity, accounting and all other functions attributable to the investment of funds.  Included in these expenses are allocations of costs for departments that support these administrative functions.  Common overhead expenses and certain service department costs incurred by us on behalf of the Exchange and its insurance subsidiaries are reimbursed by the proper entity based upon relevant utilization statistics (employee count, square footage, vehicle count, project hours, etc.) specifically measured to accomplish proportional allocations, which we believe are reasonable.  The expenses we incur and related reimbursements we receive for administrative services are presented gross in our Statement of Operations.  Reimbursements are settled on a monthly basis.  The amounts incurred for these services are reimbursed to Indemnity at cost in accordance with the subscriber's agreement and the service agreements.  State insurance regulations require that intercompany service agreements and any material amendments be approved in advance by the state insurance department.\nRecognition of service agreement revenue\nService agreement revenue primarily consists of service charges we collect from policyholders for providing multiple payment plans on policies written by the Exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries.  Service charges, which are flat dollar charges for each installment billed beyond the first installment, are recognized as revenue when bills are rendered to the policyholder.  Service agreement revenue also includes late payment and policy reinstatement fees, which are also recognized as revenue when bills are rendered to the policyholder.  We also have a service agreement with the Exchange for the use of shared office space.  Revenue related to this agreement is recognized at the time the space is used based on relevant utilization statistics.\nReclassification\nCertain amounts previously reported in the 2020 financial statements have been reclassified for comparative purposes to conform to the current period’s presentation.  \"Federal income taxes recoverable\" is now included in \"Prepaid expenses and other current assets\" in the Statements of Financial Position.\n49\nNote 3.\nRevenue\nThe\nmajority of our revenue is derived from the subscriber’s agreement between us and the subscribers (policyholders) at the Exchange.  Pursuant to the subscriber’s agreement, we earn a management fee calculated as a percentage, not to exceed\n25\n%, of all direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange. We allocate a portion of our management fee revenue, currently\n25\n% of the direct and affiliated assumed written premiums of the Exchange, between the\ntwo\nperformance obligations we have under the subscriber’s agreement.  The first performance obligation is to provide policy issuance and renewal services to the subscribers (policyholders) at the Exchange, and the second is to act as attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange, as well as the service provider for its insurance subsidiaries, with respect to all administrative services.\nThe transaction price, including management fee revenue and administrative service reimbursement revenue, includes variable consideration and is allocated based on the estimated standalone selling prices developed using industry information and other available information for similar services. A constraining estimate of variable consideration exists related to the potential for management fees to be returned if a policy were to be cancelled mid-term. Management fees are returned to the Exchange when policyholders cancel their insurance coverage mid-term and premiums are refunded to them. The constraining estimate is determined using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. The estimated transaction price, as reduced by the constraint, reflects consideration expected for performance of our services. We update the transaction price and the related allocation at least annually based upon the most recent information available or more frequently if there have been significant changes in any components considered in the transaction price.\nThe first performance obligation is to provide policy issuance and renewal services that result in executed insurance policies between the Exchange or one of its insurance subsidiaries and the subscriber (policyholder).  The subscriber (policyholder), receives economic benefits when substantially all the policy issuance or renewal services are complete and an insurance policy is issued or renewed by the Exchange or one of its insurance subsidiaries.  It is at the time of policy issuance or renewal that the allocated portion of revenue is recognized.\nThe Exchange, by virtue of its legal structure as a reciprocal insurer, does not have any employees or officers.  Therefore, it enters into contractual relationships by and through an attorney-in-fact.  Indemnity serves as the attorney-in-fact on behalf of the Exchange with respect to its administrative services in accordance with the subscriber's agreement.  The Exchange's insurance subsidiaries also utilize Indemnity for these services in accordance with the service agreements between each of the subsidiaries and Indemnity.  Collectively, these services represent a second performance obligation under the subscriber’s agreement and the service agreements.  The revenue allocated to this performance obligation is recognized over a\nfour year\nperiod representing the time over which these services are provided. The portion of revenue not yet earned is recorded as a contract liability in the Statements of Financial Position. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, Indemnity recognized revenue of $\n36.9\nmillion, $\n35.9\nmillion, and $\n33.9\nmillion, respectively, that was included in the contract liability balance at the beginning of the respective periods. The administrative services expenses we incur and the related reimbursements we receive are recorded gross in the Statement of Operations.\nIndemnity records a receivable from the Exchange for management fee revenue when the premium is written or assumed from affiliates by the Exchange.  Indemnity collects the management fee from the Exchange when the Exchange collects the premiums from the subscribers (policyholders).  As the Exchange issues policies with annual terms only, cash collections generally occur within one year.\nThe following table disaggregates revenue by our\ntwo\nperformance obligations for the years ended December 31:\n50\nNote 4.\nEarnings Per Share\nClass A and Class B basic earnings per share and Class B diluted earnings per share are calculated under the two-class method.  The two-class method allocates earnings to each class of stock based upon its dividend rights.  Class B shares are convertible into Class A shares at a conversion ratio of\n2,400\nto 1.  See Note 12, \"Capital Stock\".\nClass A diluted earnings per share are calculated under the if-converted method, which reflects the conversion of Class B shares to Class A shares.  Diluted earnings per share calculations include the dilutive effect of assumed issuance of stock-based awards under compensation plans that have the option to be paid in stock using the treasury stock method.  See Note 10, \"Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plans\".\nA reconciliation of the numerators and denominators used in the basic and diluted per-share computations is presented as follows for each class of common stock:\n51\nNote 5.\nFair Value\nFinancial instruments carried at fair value\nOur available-for-sale and equity securities are recorded at fair value, which is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction between willing market participants as of the measurement date.\nValuation techniques used to derive the fair value of our available-for-sale and equity securities are based upon observable and unobservable inputs.  Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources.  Unobservable inputs reflect our own assumptions regarding fair market value for these securities.  Financial instruments are categorized based upon the following characteristics or inputs to the valuation techniques:\n•\nLevel 1 – Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity can access at the measurement date.\n•\nLevel 2 – Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly.\n•\nLevel 3 – Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.\nEstimates of fair values for our investment portfolio are obtained primarily from a nationally recognized pricing service.  Our Level 1 securities are valued using an exchange traded price provided by the pricing service.  Pricing service valuations for Level 2 securities include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuer spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.  Pricing service valuations for Level 3 securities are based upon proprietary models and are used when observable inputs are not available or in illiquid markets.\nAlthough virtually all of our prices are obtained from third party sources, we also perform internal pricing reviews, including evaluating the methodology and inputs used to ensure that we determine the proper classification level of the financial instrument and reviewing securities with price changes that vary significantly from current market conditions or independent price sources.  Price variances are investigated and corroborated by market data and transaction volumes.  We have reviewed the pricing methodologies of our pricing service as well as other observable inputs and believe that the prices adequately consider market activity in determining fair value.\nIn limited circumstances we adjust the price received from the pricing service when, in our judgment, a better reflection of fair value is available based upon corroborating information and our knowledge and monitoring of market conditions such as a disparity in price of comparable securities and/or non-binding broker quotes.  In other circumstances, certain securities are internally priced because prices are not provided by the pricing service.\nWhen a price from the pricing service is not available, values are determined by obtaining broker/dealer quotes and/or market comparables.  When available, we obtain multiple quotes for the same security.  The ultimate value for these securities is determined based upon our best estimate of fair value using corroborating market information.  As of December 31, 2021, nearly all of our available-for-sale and equity securities were priced using a third party pricing service.\n52\nThe following tables present our fair value measurements on a recurring basis by asset class and level of input as of:\n53\nWe review the fair value hierarchy classifications each reporting period.  Transfers between hierarchy levels may occur due to changes in available market observable inputs.\nLevel 3 Assets – Year-to-Date Change:\nLevel 3 Assets – Year-to-Date Change:\n(1)    These amounts are reported as net investment income and net realized and unrealized investment gains (losses) for each of the periods presented above.\n(2)    Transfers into and/or (out) of Level 3 are primarily attributable to the availability of market observable information and the re-evaluation of the observability of pricing inputs.\nFinancial instruments not carried at fair value\nThe following table presents the carrying values and fair values of financial instruments categorized as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy that are recorded at carrying value as of:\n(1)\nThe discount rate used to calculate fair value at December 31, 2021 is reflective of a decrease in the BB+ financial yield curve.\n(2)\nThe discount rate used to calculate fair value at December 31, 2021 is reflective of an increase in U.S. Treasury bond yields.\n54\nNote 6.\nInvestments\nAvailable-for-sale securities\nSee Note 5, \"Fair Value\" for additional fair value disclosures.\nThe following tables summarize the cost and fair value, net of credit loss allowance, of our available-for-sale securities as of:\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of available-for-sale securities at December 31, 2021, are shown below by remaining contractual term to maturity.  Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties.\n55\nThe below securities have been evaluated and determined to be temporary declines in fair value for which we expect to recover our entire principal plus interest.  The following tables present available-for-sale securities based on length of time in a gross unrealized loss position as of:\nCredit loss allowance on investments\nThe current expected credit loss allowance on agent loans was $\n1.0\nmillion and $\n1.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  The current expected credit loss on available-for-sale securities was less than $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNet investment income\nInvestment income (loss), net of expenses, was generated from the following portfolios for the years ended December 31:\n(1)\nEquity in earnings (losses) of limited partnerships includes both realized gains (losses) and unrealized valuation changes.  Our limited partnership investments are included in the line item \"Other assets\" in the Statements of Financial Position.  We have made no new significant limited partnership commitments since 2006, and the balance of limited partnership investments is expected to decline over time as additional distributions are received.\n56\nRealized and unrealized investment gains (losses)\nRealized and unrealized gains (losses) on investments were as follows for the years ended December 31:\nThe portion of net unrealized gains and losses recognized during the reporting period related to equity securities held at the reporting date is calculated as follows for the years ended December 31:\nNet impairment recoveries (losses) recognized in earnings\nUpon adoption of ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, impairments on available-for-sale securities that are deemed to be credit related are recognized in earnings with a corresponding available-for-sale security allowance.  All unrealized losses related to factors other than credit are recorded in other comprehensive income.  Prior to January 1, 2020, we had the intent to sell all credit-impaired available-for-sale securities; therefore, the entire amount of the impairment charges was included in earnings and no impairments were recognized in other comprehensive income.  See also Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\".\nImpairments on available-for-sale securities and agent loans were as follows for the years ended December 31:\n57\nNote 7.\nFixed Assets\nThe following table summarizes our fixed assets by category as of December 31:\nSoftware increased primarily due to internally developed software projects completed and placed in production related to providing commercial lines new product processing capabilities as well as mainframe and billing software.\nOn December 31, 2021, we purchased the home office properties from the Exchange at the current appraised value of $\n97.5\nmillion in order to align the ownership interest of these facilities with the functions being performed at the home office campus which are mainly Indemnity's management operations.  See Note 14, \"Related Party\".  In 2020, the construction of a new office building serving as part of our principal headquarters was completed.  The building was financed using a senior secured draw term loan credit facility.  See Note 8, \"Borrowing Arrangements\".  Interest capitalized during construction was $\n3.5\nmillion and $\n3.4\nmillion, for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nProjects in progress include certain computer software and software developments costs for internal use that are not yet subject to amortization.\nDepreciation and amortization of fixed assets totaled $\n37.2\nmillion, $\n21.2\nmillion and $\n16.8\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and is included in cost of operations - policy issuance and renewal services.\n58\nNote 8.\nBorrowing Arrangements\nBank Line of Credit\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have access to a $\n100\nmillion bank revolving line of credit with a $\n25\nmillion letter of credit sublimit that expires on October 29, 2026.  As of December 31, 2021, a total of $\n99.1\nmillion remains available under the facility due to $\n0.9\nmillion outstanding letters of credit, which reduces the availability for letters of credit to $\n24.1\nmillion.  We had\nno\nborrowings outstanding on our line of credit as of December 31, 2021.  Investments with a fair value of $\n120.9\nmillion were pledged as collateral on the line at December 31, 2021.  The investments pledged as collateral have no trading restrictions and are reported as available-for-sale securities and cash and cash equivalents on our Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2021.  The bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios and debt restrictions, for our line of credit.  We are in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2021.\nTerm Loan Credit Facility\nIn 2016, we entered into a credit agreement for a $\n100\nmillion senior secured draw term loan credit facility (\"Credit Facility\") for the acquisition of real property and construction of an office building that now serves as part of our principal headquarters.  On January 1, 2019, the Credit Facility converted to a fully-amortized term loan with monthly payments of principal and interest at a fixed rate of\n4.35\n% over a period of\n28\nyears.  Investments with a fair value of $\n120.3\nmillion were pledged as collateral for the facility and are reported as available-for-sale securities and cash and cash equivalents on our Statements of Financial Position as of December 31, 2021.  The bank requires compliance with certain covenants, which include leverage ratios, debt restrictions and minimum net worth, for our Credit Facility.  We are in compliance with all covenants at December 31, 2021.\nThe remaining unpaid balance from the Credit Facility is reported at carrying value, net of unamortized loan origination and commitment fees, as long-term borrowings on our Statements of Financial Position.  See Note 5, \"Fair Value\" for the estimated fair value of these borrowings.\nAnnual principal payments\nThe following table sets forth future principal and interest payments:\n59\nNote 9.\nPostretirement Benefits\nPension plans\nOur pension plans consist of a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees and an unfunded supplemental employee retirement plan (\"SERP\") for certain members of executive and senior management.  The pension plans provide benefits to covered individuals satisfying certain age and service requirements.  The defined benefit pension plan and SERP each provide benefits through a final average earnings formula.\nAlthough we are the sponsor of these postretirement plans and record the funded status of these plans, the Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately\n58\n% of the annual benefit expense of these plans, which represents pension benefits for employees performing administrative services and their allocated share of costs for employees in departments that support the administrative functions.  For our funded pension plan, amounts are settled in cash for the portion of pension costs allocated to the Exchange and its subsidiaries.  For our unfunded plans, we pay the obligations when due and amounts are settled in cash between entities when there is a payout.\nCost of pension plans\nPension plan cost includes the following components:\n(1)     Pension plan costs represent the total cost before reimbursements to Indemnity from the Exchange and its subsidiaries.  The components of pension plan costs other than the service cost components are included in the line item \"Other (expense) income\" in the Statements of Operations after reimbursements from the Exchange and its subsidiaries.\nActuarial assumptions\nThe following table describes the assumptions at December 31 used to measure the year-end obligations and the net periodic benefit costs for the subsequent year:\n(1)    The rate of compensation increase for the employee plan is age-graded.  An equivalent single compensation increase rate of\n3.21\n% in 2021, 2020 and 2019 would produce similar results.\n(2)    In 2020, the SERP discount rate methodology was revised to utilize SERP specific cash outflows independent of the employee pension plan discount rate, eliminating a difference between pre-retirement and post-retirement rates.\nThe economic assumptions that have the most impact on the postretirement benefits expense are the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets.  The discount rate assumption used to determine the benefit obligation for all periods presented was based upon a yield curve developed from corporate bond yield information.\nThe pension plan's expected long-term rate of return represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits included in the benefit obligation are to be paid.  To determine the expected long-term rate of return assumption, we utilized models based upon historical analysis and forward-looking views of the financial markets based upon key factors such as historical returns for the asset class' applicable indices, the correlations of the asset classes under various market conditions and consensus views on future real economic growth and inflation.  The expected future return for each asset\n60\nclass is then combined by considering correlations between asset classes and the volatilities of each asset class to produce a reasonable range of asset return results within which our expected long-term rate of return assumption falls.\nFunding policy/funded status\nIn 2018, we made accelerated pension contributions totaling $\n80\nmillion.  Following our 2018 contributions, we would not expect to make a subsequent contribution until the sum of the target normal costs for plan years beginning on and after December 31, 2017 exceeds $\n80\nmillion, or earlier if a contribution is necessary to fund the plan to\n100\n%.  At that time, our funding policy will again generally be to contribute an amount equal to the greater of the target normal cost for the plan year, or the amount necessary to fund the plan to\n100\n%.  Additional contributions may be necessary or desirable due to future plan changes, our particular business or investment strategy, or pending law changes.\nThe following table sets forth the funded status of the pension plans and the amounts recognized in the Statements of Financial Position at December 31:\n(1)    The current portion of pension liabilities is included in accounts payable and accrued liabilities.\nBenefit obligations\nBenefit obligations are described in the following tables.  Accumulated and projected benefit obligations represent the obligations of a pension plan for past service as of the measurement date.  The accumulated benefit obligation is the present value of pension benefits earned as of the measurement date based on employee service and compensation prior to that date.  It differs from the projected benefit obligation in that the accumulated benefit obligation includes no assumptions to reflect expected future compensation.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the projected benefit obligation, as well as the accumulated benefit obligation at December 31:\nProjected benefit obligations increased $\n26.5\nmillion at December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020 due primarily to anticipated plan progression partially offset by actuarial gains resulting from the higher discount rate used to measure the future benefit obligations.  The discount rate increased to\n3.16\n% in 2021 from\n2.96\n% in 2020.  The plan amendments during 2021 are due to the addition of four new participants to the SERP since December 31, 2020.\n61\nBoth the defined benefit plan and the SERP had projected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31:\nThe SERP had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets at December 31:\nPension assets\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of the fair value of plan assets at December 31:\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\nNet actuarial loss and prior service cost included in accumulated other comprehensive loss that were not yet recognized as components of net benefit costs were as follows:\nOther comprehensive income\nAmounts recognized in other comprehensive income for pension plans were as follows:\n(1)    In 2021, there were\nfour\nnew SERP participants.\n62\nAsset allocation\nThe employee pension plan utilizes a return seeking and a liability asset matching allocation strategy.  It is based upon the understanding that 1) equity investments are expected to outperform debt investments over the long-term, 2) the potential volatility of short-term returns from equities is acceptable in exchange for the larger expected long-term returns, and 3) a portfolio structured across investment styles and markets (both domestic and foreign) reduces volatility.  As a result, the employee pension plan's investment portfolio utilizes a broadly diversified asset allocation across domestic and foreign equity and debt markets.  The investment portfolio is composed of commingled pools and a separate account that are dedicated exclusively to the management of employee benefit plan assets.\nThe target and actual asset allocations for the portfolio are as follows for the years ended December 31:\n(1)    U.S. equity securities\n–\n21\n% seek to achieve excess returns relative to the Russell 2000 Index.  The remaining\n79\n% of the allocation to U.S. equity securities are comprised of equity index funds that track the S&P 500.\n(2)    Non-U.S. equity securities\n–\n11\n% are allocated to international small cap investments, while another\n20\n% are allocated to international emerging market investments.  The remaining\n69\n% of the Non-U.S. equity securities are allocated to investments seeking to achieve excess returns relative to an international market index.\n(3)    Debt securities\n–\n34\n% are allocated to long U.S. Treasury Strips,\n66\n% are allocated to U.S. corporate bonds with an emphasis on long duration bonds rated A or better.\n(4)    Institutional money market fund.\n63\nThe following tables present fair value measurements for the pension plan assets by major category and level of input as of:\nEstimates of fair values of the pension plan assets are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian of our pension plan.  Our Level 1 category includes a money market mutual fund and a separate account for which the fair value is determined using an exchange traded price provided by the trustee and custodian.  Our Level 2 category includes commingled pools.  Estimates of fair values for securities held by our commingled pools are obtained primarily from the trustee and custodian.  Trustee and custodian valuation methodologies for Level 2 securities include multiple verifiable, observable inputs including benchmark yields, reported trades, broker/dealer quotes, issuers spreads, two-sided markets, benchmark securities, bids, offers, and reference data.\nEstimated future benefit payments\nThe following table sets forth amounts of benefits expected to be paid over the next 10 years from our pension plans as of:\n64\nEmployee savings plan\nAll full-time and regular part-time employees are eligible to participate in a qualified 401(k) savings plan.  We match\n100\n% of the participant contributions up to\n3\n% of compensation and\n50\n% of participant contributions over\n3\n% and up to\n5\n% of compensation.  Matching contributions paid to the plan were $\n16.1\nmillion in 2021, $\n15.8\nmillion in 2020, and $\n14.9\nmillion in 2019.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries reimbursed us for approximately\n59\n% of the matching contributions.  Employees are permitted to invest the employer-matching contributions in our Class A common stock.  Employees, other than executive and senior officers, may sell the shares at any time without restriction, provided they are in compliance with applicable insider trading laws; sales by executive and senior officers are subject to additional pre-clearance restrictions imposed by our insider trading policies.  The plan acquires shares in the open market necessary to meet the obligations of the plan.  Plan participants held\n0.2\nmillion shares of our Class A common stock at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNote 10.\nIncentive and Deferred Compensation Plans\nWe have\ntwo\nincentive plans and\ntwo\ndeferred compensation plans for our executives, senior vice presidents and other selected officers, and\ntwo\ndeferred compensation plans for our outside directors.\nAnnual incentive plan\nOur annual incentive plan (\"AIP\") is a bonus plan that pays cash to our executives, senior vice presidents and other selected officers annually.  Participants can elect to defer up to\n100\n% of the award under either the deferred compensation plan or the incentive compensation deferral plan.  If the funding qualifier is met, plan participants are eligible to receive the incentive based upon attainment of corporate and individual performance measures, which can include various financial measures.  The measures are established at the beginning of each year by the Executive Compensation and Development Committee of our Board of Directors (\"ECDC\"), with ultimate approval by the full Board of Directors.  The corporate performance measures included the growth in direct written premium and statutory combined ratio of the Exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries for all periods presented.\nLong-term incentive plan\nOur long-term incentive plan (\"LTIP\") is a performance based incentive plan designed to reward executives, senior vice presidents and other selected officers who can have a significant impact on our long-term performance and to further align the interests of such employees with those of our shareholders.  The LTIP permits grants of performance shares or units, or phantom shares to be satisfied with shares of our Class A common stock or cash payment as determined by the ECDC.  Participants can elect to defer up to\n100\n% of the award under the incentive compensation deferral plan.  The ECDC determines the form of the award to be granted at the beginning of each performance period, which is generally a\nthree-year\nperiod.  The number of shares of the Company's common stock authorized for grant under the LTIP is\n1.5\nmillion shares, with no one person able to receive more than\n250,000\nshares or the equivalent of $\n5\nmillion during any one performance period.  We repurchase our Class A common stock on the open market to settle stock awards under the plan.  We do not issue new shares of common stock to settle stock awards.  LTIP awards are considered vested at the end of each applicable performance period.\nThe LTIP provides the recipient the right to earn performance shares or units, or phantom stock based on the level of achievement of performance goals as defined by us.  Performance measures and a peer group of property and casualty companies to be used for comparison are determined by the ECDC.  The performance measures for all periods presented were the reported growth in direct written premium and statutory combined ratio of the Exchange and its property and casualty subsidiaries and return on invested assets over a\nthree-year\nperformance period as compared to the results of the peer group over the same period.  Because the award is based upon a comparison to results of a peer group over a\nthree-year\nperiod, the award accrual is based upon estimates of probable results for the remaining performance period.  This estimate is subject to variability if our results or the results of the peer group are substantially different than the results we project.\nThe fair value of LTIP awards is measured at each reporting date at the current share price of our Class A common stock.  A liability is recorded and compensation expense is recognized ratably over the performance period.\n65\nAt December 31, 2021, the plan awards for the 2019-2021 performance period, which will be granted as a cash award were fully vested.  Distributions will be made in 2022 once peer group financial information becomes available.  The estimated plan award based upon the peer group information as of September 30, 2021 is $\n5.4\nmillion.  At December 31, 2020, the fully vested cash awards for the 2018-2020 performance period that were not deferred totaled $\n10.9\nmillion and were paid to participants in June 2021.  At December 31, 2019, the fully vested cash awards for the 2017-2019 performance period that were not deferred totaled $\n7.4\nmillion and were paid to participants in June 2020.  At December 31, 2018, the awards paid in cash for the 2016-2018 performance period were fully vested and resulted in a $\n8.2\nmillion payment to plan participants in June 2019.  The ECDC has determined that the plan awards for the 2020-2022 and 2021-2023 performance periods will be paid in cash.\nThe Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for compensation costs of employees performing administrative services. Earned compensation costs are allocated to these entities and reimbursed to us in cash once the payout is made.  The total compensation cost charged to operations related to these LTIP awards, net of forfeitures, was $\n3.0\nmillion in 2021, $\n12.0\nmillion in 2020, and $\n7.3\nmillion in 2019.  The related tax benefits recognized in income were $\n0.6\nmillion in 2021, $\n2.5\nmillion in 2020, and $\n1.5\nmillion in 2019.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for approximately\n46\n% of the annual compensation cost of these plans.  At December 31, 2021, there was $\n3.8\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost for non-vested LTIP awards related to open performance periods.  Unrecognized compensation is expected to be recognized over a period of\ntwo years\n.\nDeferred compensation plan\nOur deferred compensation plan allows executives, senior vice presidents and other selected officers to elect to defer receipt of a portion of their compensation and AIP cash awards until a later date.  Employer 401(k) matching contributions that are in excess of the annual contribution or compensation limits are also credited to the participant accounts for those who elected to defer receipt of some portion of their base salary.  Participants select hypothetical investment funds for their deferrals which are credited with the hypothetical returns generated.\nIncentive compensation deferral plan\nWe have an unfunded, non-qualified incentive compensation deferral plan for participants of the AIP and LTIP.  Participants can elect to defer up to\n100\n% of their annual AIP award and/or up to\n100\n% of their LTIP award for each performance period.  Deferred awards will be credited to a deferred stock account as credits denominated in Class A shares of the Company stock until retirement or other separation from service from the Company.  Participants are\n100\n% vested at date of deferral.  The shares are held in a rabbi trust, which was established to hold the shares earned under both the incentive compensation deferral plan and the deferred stock compensation plan for outside directors.  The rabbi trust is classified and accounted for as equity in a manner consistent with the accounting for treasury stock.  Dividends received on the shares in the rabbi trust are used to purchase additional shares.  Vested share credits will be paid to participants from the rabbi trust upon separation from service in approximate equal annual installments of Class A shares for a period of\nthree years\n.  In 2021, the rabbi trust purchased\n2,570\nshares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $\n232.81\nfor $\n0.6\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2020 AIP awards and\n17,881\nshares at an average price of $\n191.25\nfor $\n3.4\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2018-2020 LTIP performance period awards deferred under the incentive compensation deferral plan.  In 2020, the rabbi trust purchased\n3,934\nshares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $\n155.92\nfor $\n0.6\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2019 AIP awards and\n18,126\nshares at an average share price of $\n185.31\nfor $\n3.4\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2017-2019 LTIP performance period awards deferred under the incentive compensation deferral plan.  In 2019, the rabbi trust purchased\n4,387\nshares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of $\n176.34\nfor $\n0.8\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2018 AIP awards deferred under the incentive compensation deferral plan.\nDeferred compensation plans for outside directors\nWe have a deferred compensation plan for our outside directors that allows participants to defer receipt of a portion of their annual compensation until a later date.  Participants select hypothetical investment funds for their deferrals which are credited with the hypothetical returns generated.\nWe also have a deferred stock compensation plan for our outside directors to further align the interests of directors with those of our shareholders that provides for a portion of the directors' annual compensation in shares of our Class A common stock.  Each director vests in the grant\n25\n% every\nthree months\nover the course of a year.  Dividends paid by us are credited to each director's account which vest immediately.  We do not issue new shares of common stock to directors.  Our practice is to repurchase shares of our Class A common stock in the open market to satisfy these awards, which are held in the rabbi trust.\n66\nThe rabbi trust purchased\n5,238\nshares of our common stock on the open market at an average price of $\n212.41\nfor $\n1.1\nmillion in 2021,\n7,401\nshares at an average price of $\n201.78\nfor $\n1.5\nmillion in 2020, and\n7,370\nshares at an average price of $\n194.62\nfor $\n1.4\nmillion in 2019 to satisfy the liability of the stock compensation plan for outside directors.  The shares are distributed to the outside director from the rabbi trust upon ending board service.  The total compensation charged to operations related to these awards totaled $\n0.8\nmillion, $\n0.9\nmillion and $\n1.1\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe following table sets forth a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of our deferred executive compensation liability as of December 31:\n(1)    Forfeitures are the result of plan participants who separated from service with the Company and are recognized in the year they occur.\nEquity compensation plan\nWe also have an equity compensation plan (\"ECP\") which is designed to reward key employees, as determined by the ECDC or the chief executive officer, who can have a significant impact on our long-term performance and to further align the interests of such employees with those of our shareholders.  The ECP permits grants of restricted shares, restricted share units and other share based awards, to be satisfied with shares of our Class A common stock or cash.  The ECDC determines the form of the award to be granted at the beginning of each performance period.  The number of shares of the Company's Class A common stock authorized for grant under the ECP is\n100,000\nshares, with no one person able to receive more than\n5,000\nshares in a calendar year.  We do not issue new shares of common stock to satisfy plan awards.  Share awards are settled through the repurchase of our Class A common stock on the open market.  Restricted share awards may be entitled to receive dividends payable during the performance period, or, if subject to performance goals, to receive dividend equivalents payable upon vesting.  Dividend equivalents may provide for the crediting of interest or hypothetical reinvestment experience payable after expiration of the performance period.  Vesting conditions are determined at the time the award is granted and may include continuation of employment for a specific period, satisfaction of performance goals and the defined performance period, and the satisfaction of any other terms and conditions as determined to be appropriate.  The ECP expires December 31, 2022, unless earlier amended or terminated by our Board of Directors.  To address the impending expiration of the ECP, on February 17, 2022, our Board of Directors approved an Amendment and Restatement of the ECP (the \"Amended and Restated ECP\") that would extend the expiration date of the plan to December 31, 2031, unless further amended or earlier terminated by the Board. The terms of the Amended and Restated ECP are substantially similar to the current ECP and are subject to the approval of shareholders at our 2022 Annual Meeting.\nTo date, all awards have been satisfied with shares of our Class A common stock.  In 2021, we purchased\n978\nClass A shares with an average share price of $\n242.01\nand a market value of $\n0.2\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2018 plan year.  In 2020, we purchased\n1,787\nClass A shares with an average share price of $\n165.82\nand a market value of $\n0.3\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2017 plan year.  In 2019, we purchased\n3,246\nshares with an average share price of $\n132.35\nand a market value of $\n0.4\nmillion to satisfy the liability for the 2016 plan year.  The total compensation charged to operations related to these ECP awards was $\n0.2\nmillion in 2021, $\n0.7\nmillion in 2020, and $\n0.5\nmillion in 2019.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries reimburse us for earned compensation costs of employees performing administrative services, which can fluctuate each year based on the plan participants.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries reimbursed us for approximately\n33\n%,\n59\n%, and\n49\n% of the awards paid in 2021, 2020, and 2019 respectively.  Unearned compensation expense of $\n0.2\nmillion is expected to be recognized over a period of\nthree years\n.\n67\nNote 11.\nIncome Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following for the years ended December 31:\nA reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with amounts determined by applying the statutory federal income tax rate to pre-tax income, is as follows for the years ended December 31:\nTemporary differences and carry-forwards, which give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities, are as follows as of December 31:\nIf we determine that any of our deferred tax assets will not result in future tax benefits, a valuation allowance must be established for the portion of the assets that are not expected to be realized.  We had\nno\nvaluation allowance recorded at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\n68\nA reconciliation of unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31 is as follows:\nThe uncertain tax position including $\n3.1\nmillion of tax expense and $\n0.9\nmillion of interest expense recorded in a prior year was settled during 2019.  This settlement reduced our effective tax rate by\n1.0\n% in 2019.  The amounts recorded in a prior year resulted from the difference in measuring the tax liability at the previous tax rate and the current enacted tax rate.\nTax years ending December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 remain open to IRS examination.  We are not currently under IRS audit, nor have we been notified of an upcoming IRS audit.\nWe are the attorney-in-fact for the subscribers (policyholders) at the Exchange, a reciprocal insurance exchange.  In that capacity, we provide all services and facilities necessary to conduct the Exchange's insurance business.  Indemnity and the Exchange together constitute a single insurance business.  Consequently, we are not subject to state corporate income or franchise taxes in states where the Exchange conducts its business and the states collect premium tax in lieu of corporate income or franchise tax, as a result of the Exchange's remittance of premium taxes in those states.\n69\nNote 12.\nCapital Stock\nClass A and B common stock\nWe have\ntwo\nclasses of common stock: Class A which has a dividend preference and Class B which has voting power and a conversion right.  Each share of Class A common stock outstanding at the time of the declaration of any dividend upon shares of Class B common stock shall be entitled to a dividend payable at the same time, at the same record date, and in an amount at least equal to 2/3 of 1.0% of any dividend declared on each share of Class B common stock.  We may declare and pay a dividend in respect to Class A common stock without any requirement that any dividend be declared and paid in respect to Class B common stock.  Sole shareholder voting power is vested in Class B common stock except insofar as any applicable law shall permit Class A common shareholders to vote as a class in regards to any changes in the rights, preferences, and privileges attaching to Class A common stock.  Holders of Class B shares may, at their option, convert their shares into Class A shares at the rate of\n2,400\nClass A shares per Class B share.  There were\nno\nshares of Class B common stock converted into Class A common stock in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nStock repurchases\nOur Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program effective January 1, 1999 allowing the repurchase of our outstanding Class A nonvoting common stock.  In 2011, our Board of Directors approved a continuation of the current stock repurchase program for a total of $\n150\nmillion, with no time limitation.  Treasury shares are recorded in the Statements of Financial Position at total cost based upon trade date.  There were\nno\nshares repurchased under this program during 2021, 2020 or 2019.  We had approximately $\n17.8\nmillion of repurchase authority remaining under this program at December 31, 2021, based upon trade date.\nWe made stock repurchases in 2021, 2020, and 2019 outside of our publicly announced share repurchase program related to stock-based awards.  See Note 10, \"Incentive and Deferred Compensation Plans\" for additional information.\n70\nNote 13.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nChanges in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") (loss) by component, including amounts reclassified to other comprehensive income (\"OCI\") (loss) and the related line item in the Statements of Operations where net income is presented, are as follows for the year ended December 31:\n(1)\nThese components of AOCI (loss) are included in the computation of net periodic pension cost.  See Note 9, \"Postretirement Benefits\", for additional information.\n71\nNote 14.\nRelated Party\nManagement fee\nA management fee is charged to the Exchange for services we provide under the subscriber's agreement with subscribers at the Exchange.  The fee is a percentage of direct and affiliated assumed premiums written by the Exchange.  This percentage rate is determined at least annually by our Board of Directors but cannot exceed\n25\n%.  The management fee rate charged the Exchange was\n25\n% in 2021, 2020 and 2019.  The Board of Directors elected to maintain the fee at\n25\n% beginning January 1, 2022.\nThere is no provision in the subscriber's agreement for termination of our appointment as attorney-in-fact by the subscribers at the Exchange and the appointment is not affected by a policyholder's disability or incapacity.\nInsurance holding company system\nMost states have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems, defined as\ntwo\nor more affiliated persons,\none\nor more of which is an insurer.  The Exchange has the following wholly owned property and casualty subsidiaries:  Erie Insurance Company, Erie Insurance Company of New York, Erie Insurance Property & Casualty Company and Flagship City Insurance Company, and a wholly owned life insurance company, Erie Family Life Insurance Company.  Indemnity and the Exchange, and its wholly owned subsidiaries, meet the definition of an insurance holding company system.\nAll transactions within a holding company system affecting the member insurers of the holding company system must be fair and reasonable and any charges or fees for services performed must be reasonable.  Approval by the applicable insurance commissioner is required prior to the consummation of transactions affecting the members within a holding company system.\nShared facilities\nWe leased the home office from the Exchange until December 31, 2021, at which time we purchased the home office properties from the Exchange to align the ownership interest of these facilities with the functions being performed at the home office campus which are mainly Indemnity's management operations. See Note 7, \"Fixed Assets\" for additional information.  Lease expense totaled $\n6.1\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Operating expenses, including utilities, cleaning, repairs, real estate taxes, property insurance, and leasehold improvements totaled $\n15.7\nmillion in both 2021 and 2020, respectively, and $\n16.7\nmillion in 2019.  The Exchange and its subsidiaries reimbursed us for rent costs and related operating expenses of shared facilities used to perform administrative services, which are allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied.  Reimbursements related to the use of this space totaled $\n4.8\nmillion, $\n4.6\nmillion, and $\n4.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nEffective July 1, 2021, the Exchange and its subsidiaries entered into a service agreement with Indemnity to use space in Indemnity-owned properties.  The amount charged is based on rental rates of like property in Erie, Pennsylvania and the usage or square footage occupied.  In 2021, income earned from the Exchange and its subsidiaries for the use of space totaled $\n0.2\nmillion.  Operating expenses including utilities, cleaning, repairs, real estate taxes, property insurance, and leasehold improvements are allocated based upon usage or square footage occupied.  The home office was added to this agreement effective January 1, 2022.\nNote 15.\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nFinancial instruments could potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk, including our unsecured receivables from the Exchange.  A large majority of our revenue and receivables are from the Exchange and its affiliates.  See also Note 1, \"Nature of Operations\".  Net management fee amounts and other reimbursements due from the Exchange and its affiliates were $\n479.1\nmillion and $\n494.6\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Upon adoption of ASU 2016-13, we recorded an allowance for current expected credit losses of $\n0.6\nmillion related to the receivables from the Exchange and affiliates. See also Note 2, \"Significant Accounting Policies\". The current expected credit loss allowance was $\n0.5\nmillion and $\n0.6\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n72\nNote 16.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nIn 2020, we entered into an agreement with a bank for the establishment of a loan participation program for agent loans.  The maximum amount of loans to be funded through this program is $\n100\nmillion.  We have committed to fund a minimum of\n30\n% of each loan executed through this program.  As of December 31, 2021, the total loans executed under this agreement totaled $\n25.8\nmillion, of which our portion of the loans is $\n9.6\nmillion.  Additionally, we have agreed to guarantee a portion of the funding provided by the other participants in the program in the event of default.  As of December 31, 2021, our maximum potential amount of future payments on the guaranteed portion is $\n2.9\nmillion.  All loan payments under the participation program are current as of December 31, 2021.\nWe are involved in litigation arising in the ordinary course of conducting business.  In accordance with current accounting standards for loss contingencies and based upon information currently known to us, we establish reserves for litigation when it is probable that a loss associated with a claim or proceeding has been incurred and the amount of the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.  When no amount within the range of loss is a better estimate than any other amount, we accrue the minimum amount of the estimable loss.  To the extent that such litigation against us may have an exposure to a loss in excess of the amount we have accrued, we believe that such excess would not be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.  Legal fees are expensed as incurred.  We believe that our accruals for legal proceedings are appropriate and, individually and in the aggregate, are not expected to be material to our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nWe review all litigation on an ongoing basis when making accrual and disclosure decisions.  For certain legal proceedings, we cannot reasonably estimate losses or a range of loss, if any, particularly for proceedings that are in their early stages of development or where the plaintiffs seek indeterminate damages.  Various factors, including, but not limited to, the outcome of potentially lengthy discovery and the resolution of important factual questions, may need to be determined before probability can be established or before a loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated.  If the loss contingency in question is not both probable and reasonably estimable, we do not establish an accrual and the matter will continue to be monitored for any developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and reasonably estimable.  In the event that a legal proceeding results in a substantial judgment against, or settlement by, us, there can be no assurance that any resulting liability or financial commitment would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\n73\nNote 17.\nSupplementary Data on Cash Flows\nA reconciliation of net income to net cash provided by operating activities as presented in the Statements of Cash Flows is as follows for the years ended December 31:\nNote 18.\nSubsequent Events\nNo items were identified in this period subsequent to the financial statement date that required adjustment or additional disclosure.\n74"

In our opinion, Erie Indemnity Company (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the statements of financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 and the related notes of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nCleveland, OH\nFebruary 24, 2022\n76\nPART III"
