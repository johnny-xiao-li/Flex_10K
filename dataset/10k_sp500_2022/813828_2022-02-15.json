    "text": "Overview\nWe are a leading global media and entertainment company that creates premium content and experiences for audiences worldwide. We offer broadcast and cable television programming, innovative streaming services and digital video products, provide powerful capabilities in production, distribution and advertising solutions, and have one of the industry’s most extensive libraries of television and film titles. Our portfolio of iconic consumer brands includes Paramount+, Pluto TV, CBS, Showtime Networks, Paramount Pictures, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central and BET. Effective February 16, 2022, we are changing our name to Paramount Global, a name that represents our rich and storied history in entertainment and embraces our transition into the future.\nOur global ecosystem of pay, free and premium streaming services grew significantly in 2021. Global streaming subscribers grew to 56.1 million as of December 31, 2021, an 88% increase year-over-year. We rebranded CBS All Access as Paramount+, our subscription streaming service that combines live sports, news and entertainment content, reaching 32.8 million global subscribers as of December 31, 2021. Pluto TV, our free advertising-supported streaming television (“FAST”) service, surpassed $1 billion in revenue for the year and reached 64.4 million global monthly active users (“MAUs”) for December 2021, a 49% increase year-over-year. We are investing in and scaling our streaming ecosystem through compelling content, broad distribution and international expansion.\nIn 2021, we demonstrated the continued breadth and depth of our content capabilities across broadcast and cable television, streaming and film. We attracted viewers domestically with sports, news and live events, including the National Football League (the “NFL”) and Union of European Football Associations (“UEFA”) games,\n60 Minutes\nand\nAdele One Night Only\n. Hit movies included\nA Quiet Place Part II\n, which launched in theaters and on Paramount+ following a 45-day theatrical window, and\nPAW Patrol: The Movie\nand\nClifford the Big Red Dog\n,\nwhich in the United States (“U.S.”) were released “day and date” in theaters and on Paramount+.\nCBS remained the most-watched network in Daytime and Late Night, and we had more top 25 original cable series among key demographics than any other cable family. We are working to leverage our successful linear content to drive growth in streaming.\n1883\n, Taylor Sheridan’s prequel to\nYellowstone\n, debuted in 2021 as both the most watched\nI-1\noriginal scripted drama on Paramount+ and, as part of a special airing on Paramount Network, the highest rated cable series premiere since 2015.\nFrom our studios to streaming, we focused on expanding our global footprint and building key partnerships in 2021. We launched Pluto TV in Italy and announced plans to launch in the Nordics in 2022. We announced a strategic partnership to launch Paramount+ on Sky platforms in certain western European countries, as well as a joint venture with Comcast to launch SkyShowtime, a new streaming service expected to be available in more than 20 European territories. We acquired a majority stake in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, which, when combined with production capabilities of ViacomCBS International Studios (“VIS”) and our broadcasters Televisión Federal S.A. (“Telefe”) and Chilevisión, solidified our status as a leading global Spanish-language content creator.\nOur traditional\nbusiness remained strong in 2021, where affiliate revenues continued to benefit from expanded distribution and advertising revenues benefited from an improved marketplace and EyeQ, our digital advertising platform that reaches millions of full-episode monthly unique viewers in the U.S. We entered into comprehensive agreements with key distributors that included our portfolio of streaming services, in addition to continued carriage of our cable and broadcast television networks.\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our commitment to divest noncore assets, including CBS’ former headquarters, commonly known as Black Rock, as well as CBS Studio Center in Los Angeles, California. And in March 2021, we completed public equity offerings in which we raised approximately $2.7 billion in net proceeds. These transactions increased our ability to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including streaming.\nWe continued our commitment to diversity, equity and inclusion (“DE&I”) in 2021. We hosted our third annual Global Inclusion Week, a weeklong initiative featuring conversations, panels and workshops designed to ensure our workforce and culture reflect, celebrate and elevate the diversity of our audiences and communities. We also launched Content for Change, a companywide initiative designed to use the power of our content, creative supply chain and culture to counteract the narratives that enable racism, bias, stereotypes and hate. Building on our 2020 companywide Materiality Assessment and first Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) Report, in 2021 we released our second ESG Report, which included our first set of overarching goals across our three environmental, social and governance pillars.

Paramount Animation coproduced\nThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run\n, which was digitally released domestically simultaneously on premium video on demand and Paramount+ in March 2021. Paramount Animation also produced\nRumble\n, which was released on Paramount+ in the U.S. in December 2021.\nParamount Television Studios\nParamount Television Studios develops and finances a wide range of television content across all platforms for distribution worldwide. Paramount Television Studios’ productions include\nAmerican Gigolo\nfor Showtime\nI-11\nNetworks;\nMade For Love\nand\nStation Eleven\nfor HBO Max;\nShantaram\n,\nDefending Jacob\nand\nHome\nBefore Dark\nfor Apple TV+;\nTom Clancy’s Jack Ryan\nfor Amazon;\nThe Haunting of Bly Manor\nfor Netflix; and\nCatch-22\nfor Hulu.\nMiramax\nMiramax, a consolidated joint venture with beIN Media Group, is a global film and television studio with an extensive library of content. We have exclusive, long-term rights to distribute Miramax’s library of more than 650 titles, which includes\nPulp Fiction\n,\nShakespeare in Love\n,\nGood Will Hunting\n,\nNo Country for Old Men\nand\nScary Movie\n. We also have certain rights to coproduce, co-finance and/or distribute new film and television projects with Miramax.\nFilm Production, Distribution and Financing\nWe\nproduce many of the films we release and also acquire films for distribution from third parties. In some cases, we co-finance and/or co-distribute films with third parties, including other studios. We\nalso enter into film-specific financing and multipicture financing arrangements from time to time under which third parties participate in the financing of the costs of a film or group of films in exchange for an economic participation and a partial copyright interest. We\ndistribute films worldwide or in select territories in various media and may engage third-party distributors for certain films in certain territories.\nDomestically, we\ngenerally market and distribute our own theatrical and home entertainment releases. Internationally, we distribute theatrical releases through our international affiliates or, in territories where we have no operating presence, through United International Pictures, our joint venture with Universal Studios, or other third-party distributors.\nFor home entertainment releases, DVD and Blu-ray discs are distributed internationally by local licensees\n. We also license films and television shows domestically and/or internationally to a variety of platforms.\nCompetition\nAll of our businesses operate in highly competitive environments, and compete for creative talent and intellectual property, as well as for audiences and distribution of our content.\nWe compete with a variety of media, technology and entertainment companies that have substantial resources to produce, acquire and distribute content around the world, including broadcast networks, basic and premium cable networks, streaming services, film and television studios, production groups, independent producers and syndicators, television stations and television station groups. We compete with other content creators for creative talent including producers, directors, actors and writers, as well as for new program ideas and intellectual property and for the acquisition of popular programming.\nOur businesses also face significant competition for audiences from various sources. We compete for audiences for our films and television content with releases from other film studios, television producers and streaming services, as well as with other forms of entertainment and consumer spending outlets. We also compete for audiences and advertising revenues primarily with other broadcast and cable television networks; streaming services; social media platforms; websites, apps and other online experiences; radio programming; and print media. In addition, our television businesses face increasing competition from technologies providing digital audio and visual content in ways that allow audiences to consume content of their choosing while avoiding traditional commercial advertising. Moreover, our businesses face competition from the many other entertainment options available to consumers including video games, sports, travel and outdoor recreation.\nWe also face competition for distribution of our content. Our television businesses compete for distribution of our program services (and receipt of related fees) with other broadcast networks, cable networks and programmers. The CBS Network competes with other broadcast networks to secure affiliations with independently owned\nI-12\ntelevision stations to ensure the effective distribution of network programming in the U.S. We also compete with studios and other producers of entertainment content for distribution on third-party platforms.\nFor additional information regarding competition, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors —\nOur businesses operate in industries that are highly competitive\n.”\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Strategy\nWe believe the media and entertainment industry plays an important role in shaping culture and conversations. We take this role seriously and are committed to advancing and strengthening our approach to issues, opportunities and risks related to ESG matters to help serve our stockholders, employees, partners, audiences and the communities in which we operate, as well as to enhance our business. Our ESG strategy is centered on an understanding of our biggest opportunities and risks.\nWe organize our ESG work into three pillars: (1) On-Screen Content & Social Impact, (2) Workforce & Culture and (3) Sustainable Production & Operations. On-Screen Content & Social Impact addresses the opportunities and responsibilities we have to represent, inform and influence through our content and brands. Workforce & Culture focuses on our efforts to recruit and retain the best employees, treat contractors and partners well, and foster an environment where people feel welcome and safe. Sustainable Production & Operations addresses the environmental and social impacts of our operations and facilities, film and television productions and other activities.\nBuilding on our 2020 companywide Materiality Assessment and first ESG Report, in 2021 we released our second ESG Report, which is available on our website, and included our first set of overarching goals for each of these pillars to help focus our efforts and assess our progress. We are committed to continuing to identify, measure, map and report on the ESG impact of our global operations.\nESG Governance\nOur ESG efforts are a companywide commitment led by a dedicated ESG team that oversees day-to-day strategy and implementation. Our ESG team works closely with our ESG Council, a cross-functional team of senior leadership and subject matter experts spanning our brands, legal, investor relations, global inclusion, human resources, finance, real estate and environmental health and safety, to guide our strategy and reporting and help spread and instill our ESG values across the Company. The ESG team works in close collaboration with our Chief Executive Officer, Chief Financial Officer, General Counsel and other senior executives who together make up our ESG Steering Committee. These leaders are actively involved in reviewing and refining our ESG strategies, programs and policies. The ESG team regularly updates the Nominating and Governance Committee of our Board of Directors, which, pursuant to its charter, oversees and monitors significant issues impacting our culture and reputation, as well as our handling of ESG issues.\nHuman Capital Management\nWe aim to build a culture that attracts and retains the best employees and a workplace where people feel welcome, safe and inspired to bring their whole self to work.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 22,965 full- and part-time employees in 37 countries worldwide and had approximately 4,300 project-based staff on our payroll. We also use temporary employees in the ordinary course of our business.\nOur human capital management strategy is intended to address the areas described below, and additional information can be found in our ESG Report.\nI-13\nA Culture of Diversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe seek to mold a companywide culture built on our core values and anchored in a dynamic and proactive approach to DE&I through a range of partnerships, collaborations, programs and initiatives, some of which are described below.\n•\nMany of our brands maintain inclusivity councils to address their DE&I activities and the DE&I challenges in their businesses.\n•\nWe partner with hundreds of diversity-focused institutions globally that are committed to supporting women, BIPOC and LGBTQ+ individuals, veterans and/or persons with disabilities. We have placed a particular focus on organizations advancing the causes of racial justice, anti-hate and social equity.\n•\nWe sponsor internal and external professional development programs and campus-to-career initiatives aimed at underrepresented groups.\n•\nOur job postings reach an expansive network that includes more than 60 diversity-focused job boards. We use third-party technology to identify and remove biasing language from our job descriptions.\n•\nWe sponsor eight active employee-led Employee Resource Groups (“ERGs”) with 53 chapters in 19 locations worldwide. More than half of our employees are members of these employee-led groups. Our ERGs provide support for certain business and corporate initiatives.\n•\nOur CEO has signed onto the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge and the Company was a founding signatory for Management Leadership for Tomorrow’s (“MLT”) Black Equity at Work Certification Program (“BEW”). The MLT BEW is a third-party validation program that aims to drive measurable progress in improving representation and racial equity in the workplace.\n•\nOf our U.S. employees, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 49% were female and approximately 39% self-identified as part of a racial or ethnic minority group. Of our U.S. employees with Vice President titles and above, as of December 31, 2021, approximately 49% were female and approximately 28% self-identified as part of a racial or ethnic minority group.\n•\nIn 2021, we set new goals to help accelerate our performance on key DE&I objectives, including a target global hire and promotion rate for female Senior Vice Presidents and above and a target U.S. hire and promotion rate for ethnically diverse Vice Presidents and above.\nPreventing Harassment and Discrimination\nWe remain committed to building a work environment free of harassment and discrimination so that our employees can focus on doing their best work. We have enacted policies addressing harassment, discrimination and other behaviors that could create a hostile workplace, some of which are described below.\n•\nOur Business Conduct Statement provides employees with clear examples of harassment and discrimination and guidance on how to create a safe and inclusive environment for all. We make annual trainings on sexual harassment, discrimination and retaliation prevention available to all employees.\n•\nWe monitor employee diversity data trends — including the promotion rates of women and ethnically diverse employees compared to their male or white peers, respectively — and watch for any patterns that might suggest discrimination or unconscious bias so that we can seek to address them.\nI-14\n•\nWe require that employees report any incidents of harassment and discrimination that they witness. Among other ways, employees can report incidents of harassment or discrimination using our anonymous third-party managed complaint and reporting hotline, called OPENLINE.\nEmployee Attraction, Retention and Training\nOur training, mentoring and career mobility programs embody our culture of DE&I as we recruit, retain and engage our employees. We strive to create an inclusive culture in which our employees and talent feel supported, heard and understood and in which employees of all backgrounds feel like they belong and have the opportunity to thrive. Some of these programs are described below.\n•\nWe offer a broad spectrum of learning opportunities for our employees, including leadership-specific training for employees who are new to their positions, taking on an expanded scope of responsibilities, or otherwise seeking to expand their impact. We also offer regular manager and employee classes focused on specific skills, leader learning journeys to help people leaders implement new capabilities over several months, and team-based workshops for groups who want to learn together.\n•\nWe offer a range of financial and nonfinancial compensation and benefits, including health, life and disability insurance; matching retirement and profit-sharing contributions; flexible paid time off; paid volunteer time; financial planning assistance; multiple wellness programs; and parental, caregiving, bereavement and military leave benefits. We also offer tuition support for certain employees. In 2021, we began offering our employees access to a behavior-change app designed to help our employees manage stress, improve focus and enhance overall well-being.\n•\nWe offer flexible work hours for many of our full-time and part-time employees.\n•\nIn 2021, we launched our first global employee engagement survey, administered by an independent third party, to assess our efforts around employee engagement, inclusion and well-being. Our executive officers (and managers, on a team level) reviewed the survey results and instituted action plans to address feedback and opportunity areas. We continue to track our progress on these efforts through shorter, periodic “pulse” engagement surveys.\n•\nAs a result of our focus on employee satisfaction and inclusiveness, we have been recognized for our workplace culture, including being named a 2021 Most Loved Workplace by Newsweek, one of America’s Best Employers for Diversity by Forbes and one of the Top 100 workplaces with the Best D&I Initiatives in 2021 by Mogul.\nHealth, Safety and Security\nThe health and safety of our workers, particularly across our productions worldwide, remains a top priority. We strive to take a proactive approach to identifying and mitigating health, safety and security risks. Some of the steps we take are described below.\n•\nIn 2021, we began to centralize our nonproduction environmental health and safety (“EHS”) functions. We appointed a new Senior Vice President of EHS in an effort to ensure that these critical functions are managed consistently and reported on externally in an appropriate way.\n•\nWe have on-site health care at some office and production sites, as well as medics and medical support at many production sites.\n•\nWe perform risk assessments of daily work processes across our productions, offices and other work sites and develop hazard reduction, avoidance and mitigation plans. We also track and report safety, health and security incident data across the company.\nI-15\n•\nOur Global Security Operations Center oversees security and emergency response efforts and undertakes risk scans in an effort to identify potential security risks.\n•\nAfter COVID-19 caused an initial period in which our offices closed and production ceased, we restarted productions in mid-2020 and began to manage a slow and safe return-to-office process. We have established a number of COVID-19-related safety protocols in our offices, on our productions and with respect to nonproduction activities. While the majority of our employees had the opportunity to work at a reduced capacity from certain offices, most of our office employees worked remotely in 2021.\nSocial Impact and Corporate Social Responsibility\nWe leverage our platforms and diverse capabilities to create positive social impacts, including by exploring and raising awareness of issues that align with our values and impact our viewers such as climate change, mental health, civic engagement and social justice. Our commitment to social impact is not only exemplified by the content we produce, but also our community service projects, philanthropy and employee engagement efforts, including our 25\nth\nannual Community Day, which was held virtually in 2021 and involved employees from 23 regions around the world across more than 100 volunteer projects.\nContent for Change\nContent for Change is a social justice initiative launched by BET in 2020 that is anchored in the belief that storytelling has the power to transform how we see ourselves and one another. In 2021, we expanded the program across the Company with three interrelated objectives: (1) leveraging content to counteract racism, bias, stereotypes and hate; (2) striving for equity across our entire creative supply chain; and (3) creating a culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging that continuously informs and enhances the stories we tell through our content. This initiative builds upon our commitment to our community, as well as to DE&I and fostering an inclusive company culture.\nRegulation\nOur businesses and the intellectual property they create or acquire are subject to and affected by laws and regulations of U.S. federal, state and local governmental authorities, as well as laws and regulations of countries other than the U.S. and pan-national bodies such as the European Union (“E.U.”). The laws and regulations affecting our businesses are constantly subject to change, as are the protections that those laws and regulations afford us. The discussion below describes certain, but not all, present and proposed laws and regulations affecting our businesses.\nFCC and Similar Regulation\nThe FCC regulates broadcast television, some aspects of cable network programming, and certain programming delivered by internet protocol in the U.S., pursuant to U.S. federal law, including the Communications Act. Violation of FCC regulations can result in substantial monetary fines, the imposition of reporting obligations, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license.\nLicense Renewals and Transfers\nEach of our owned television stations in the U.S. must be licensed by the FCC. Television broadcast licenses are typically granted for eight-year terms, and we must obtain renewals as they expire to continue operating our stations. The Communications Act requires the FCC to renew a broadcast license if the FCC finds that (1) the station has served the public interest, convenience and necessity; (2) with respect to the station, there have been no serious violations by the licensee of either the Communications Act or FCC regulations; and (3) there have been no other violations by the licensee of the Communications Act or FCC regulations that, taken together,\nI-16\nconstitute a pattern of abuse. As of February 14, 2022, we had three pending renewal applications, and we will be filing applications with respect to most of our remaining stations on a staggered basis in 2022 and 2023. A station remains authorized to operate while its license renewal application is pending. In addition, the Communications Act requires prior FCC approval for the assignment of a license or transfer of control of an FCC licensee.\nBroadcast Ownership Regulation\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules impose limits on local and national broadcast television station ownership in the U.S. The broadcast ownership rules discussed below are the most relevant to our operations in the U.S. In 2019, a federal appellate court vacated a 2017 FCC decision that had (1) repealed rules restricting common ownership of a TV station with either a daily newspaper or one or more radio stations in the same local market, and (2) loosened a rule restricting common ownership of TV stations within the same market.\nLocal Television Ownership\nThe FCC’s local television ownership rule generally limits common ownership of two full-power stations in a market unless at least one of the owned stations is not a top-four ranked station in the market based on audience share, provided that the FCC may permit such common ownership if it finds such ownership would serve the public interest, convenience and necessity.\nDual Network Rule\nThe dual network rule effectively prohibits any of the four major U.S. broadcast networks — ABC, CBS, FOX and NBC — from combining or being under common control.\nTelevision National Audience Reach Limitation\nUnder the national television ownership rule, one party may not own television stations that reach more than 39% of all U.S. television households. However, for purposes of this rule, a UHF station is afforded a “discount” and is therefore attributed with reaching only 50% of the television households in its market. We currently own and operate television stations that reach approximately 38% of all U.S. television households, but we are attributed with reaching approximately 24% of all such households for purposes of the national ownership rule because of the discount.\nForeign Ownership\nIn general, the Communications Act restricts foreign individuals or entities from collectively owning more than 25% of our voting power or equity. FCC approval is required to exceed the 25% threshold. The FCC has approved foreign ownership levels of up to 100% in certain instances, subsequent to its review and approval of specific, named foreign individuals.\nCable and Satellite Carriage of Television Broadcast Stations\nThe Communications Act and FCC rules govern the retransmission of broadcast television stations by cable system operators, direct broadcast satellite operators, and other MVPDs in the U.S. Pursuant to these regulations, we have elected to negotiate with MVPDs for the right to carry our broadcast television stations via retransmission consent agreements. The Communications Act and FCC regulations require that broadcasters and some categories of MVPDs negotiate in good faith for retransmission consent. Some MVPDs have sought changes to federal law that would eliminate or otherwise limit the ability of broadcasters to obtain fair compensation for the grant of retransmission consent.\nI-17\nProgram Regulation\nThe FCC also regulates the content of broadcast, cable network, and other video programming. The FCC prohibits broadcasters from airing obscene material at any time and indecent or profane material between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. The FCC’s maximum forfeiture penalty per station for broadcasting indecent or profane programming is approximately $445,445 per indecent or profane utterance or image, with a maximum forfeiture exposure of approximately $4.1 million for any continuing violation arising from a single act or failure to act. The FCC also actively monitors compliance with requirements that apply to broadcasters and cable networks relating to political advertising, identification of program sponsors, and the use and integrity of the Emergency Alert System. In addition, FCC regulations require the closed captioning of almost all broadcast and cable programming, as well as certain programming in the U.S. delivered by internet protocol. Broadcast television stations in certain markets that are affiliated with one of the four major U.S. broadcast networks must also provide a certain amount of programming every quarter that includes audio description (audio-narrated description of a television program’s key visual elements that make the programming accessible to blind and low-vision viewers).\nChildren’s Programming\nOur business is subject to various regulations in the U.S. and abroad applicable to children’s programming. U.S. federal law and FCC rules limit the amount and content of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast television stations and cable networks during programming designed for children 12 years of age and younger, and the FCC also limits the display of certain commercial website addresses during children’s programming. Moreover, each of our broadcast television stations in the U.S. is required to air, in general, three hours per week of programming specifically designed to meet the educational and informational programming needs of children 16 years of age and younger.\nIn addition, some policymakers have sought limitations on food and beverage marketing in media popular with children and teens. For example, restrictions on the television advertising of foods high in fat, salt and sugar (“HFSS”) to children aged 15 and under have been in place in the U.K. since 2007. The U.K. government has announced its intention to impose a ban, effective in 2023, on all HFSS advertising before 9:00 p.m. on television and a total ban online. Various laws with similar objectives have also been enacted in Ireland, Turkey, Mexico, Chile, Argentina, Peru, Taiwan and South Korea, and significant pressure for similar restrictions continues to be felt globally, most acutely in Australia, Brazil, Canada, Colombia, India, Hungary, Singapore, South Africa and France. The implementation of these or similar limitations and restrictions could have a negative impact on our television advertising revenues, particularly for our networks with programming for children and teens.\nBroadcast Transmission Standard\nIn 2017, the FCC adopted rules to permit television broadcasters to voluntarily broadcast using the “Next Generation” broadcast television transmission standard developed by the Advanced Television Systems Committee, Inc., also called “ATSC 3.0.” Those full-service television stations using the standard are subject to certain requirements, including the obligation to continue broadcasting a generally identical program stream in the current ATSC 1.0 broadcast standard. The ATSC 3.0 standard can be used to offer better picture quality and improved mobile broadcast viewing. A television station converting to ATSC 3.0 operation will incur significant costs in equipment purchases and upgrades. In addition, consumers may be required to obtain new television sets or other equipment that are capable of receiving ATSC 3.0 broadcasts. We are participating in ATSC 3.0 partnerships with other broadcasters and may enter into additional partnerships in the future.\nGlobal Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws\nA number of data protection and privacy laws impact, or may impact, the manner in which we collect, process and transfer personal data. In the E.U., the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance. In the U.S., the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) went into effect in January 2020 and created a host of new obligations for businesses\nI-18\nregarding how they handle the personal information of California residents, including creating new data access, data deletion and opt out rights. The new California Privacy Right Act will replace the CCPA in early 2023 and creates even more onerous obligations, including the need to implement mechanisms for consumers to opt out of personal data sharing with third parties in the context of digital advertising. A number of other regions where we do business, including the U.S., Asia and Latin America, have enacted or are considering new data protection legislation and regulations that may impact our business activities that involve the processing of personal data.\nIn addition, some of the mechanisms we previously relied upon for the international transfer of personal data from the E.U. to other countries including the U.S., are no longer available. New legal requirements such as utilizing the new standard contractual clauses recently approved by the European Commission require significant resources going forward to perform international data transfer assessments.\nWe are also subject to laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children, including the privacy of minors online. The U.S. Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (“COPPA”) limits the collection by operators of websites or online services of personal information online from children under the age of 13. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission has yet to issue a proposed new COPPA rule as part of its review of its regulations implementing COPPA begun in 2019; however, the agency as well as some state Attorneys General have continued to bring enforcement cases under the existing COPPA rule. Since the enactment of GDPR in 2018, several countries in the E.U. and U.K. have issued guidance documents or codes of conduct with respect to the online privacy of children under 18, which impact countries outside of the U.K. and E.U., including the U.S. and in Australia. Such regulations may also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these online services, sites and apps and may impose strict liability on us for certain of our actions, as well as certain actions of our advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. In the U.S., state and federal policymakers are also considering regulatory and legislative methods to protect consumer privacy on the internet, and these efforts have focused particular attention on children and teens. Congress has held several hearings on protecting children and teens online and has signaled that an update to COPPA with stronger protections for children and teens is likely.\nSee “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection —\nWe are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection\n.”\nIntellectual Property\nWe are fundamentally a content company, and the trademark, copyright, patent and other intellectual property laws that protect our brands and content are extremely important to us. It is our practice to protect our brands, content and related intellectual property. Unauthorized exploitation of copyrighted works interferes with the legitimate market and disrupts our ability to distribute and monetize our content. The infringement of our intellectual property rights presents a significant challenge to our industry, and we take a number of steps to address this concern. For example, where possible, we use technologies, such as encryption, watermarking, and digital rights management tools, to protect our content from piracy. We are also actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, including: monitoring services that unlawfully distribute or otherwise infringe our content and sending takedown or cease-and-desist notices in appropriate circumstances; using filtering technologies employed by some social media companies and other platforms hosting our content; working with intermediaries and other third parties to address current infringements and prevent more in the future; and pursuing litigation and referrals to law enforcement. Through partnerships with various organizations, we also are actively involved in educational outreach to the creative community, state and federal government officials and other stakeholders in an effort to marshal greater resources to combat intellectual property infringement. Additionally, we participate in various industrywide enforcement initiatives, public relations programs and legislative activities on a worldwide basis. For example, we have had notable success with site-blocking efforts in parts of Europe, Asia, Latin America and Australia, which can be effective in steering consumers away from piracy platforms and toward legitimate platforms.\nI-19\nNotwithstanding these efforts and the many legal protections that exist to combat piracy, the proliferation of infringing services and the sophistication of and continued technological advancement in the tools used in infringing activities continues to be a challenge.\nThe failure to maintain enhanced legal protections and enforcement tools and to update those tools as threats evolve could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect our intellectual property, which could negatively impact its value and further increase the costs of enforcing our rights as we continue to expend substantial resources to protect our content.\nOur Executive Officers\nOur executive officers as of February 14, 2022, are as follows:\nRobert M.

    "text": "A wide range of risks may affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, now and in the future. We consider the risks described below to be the most significant. There may be other currently unknown or unpredictable factors that could have adverse effects on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Our Business and Industry\nIf our streaming initiatives are unsuccessful, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected\nStreaming is intensely competitive and cash intensive and there can be no assurance that our streaming initiatives will be profitable or otherwise successful. Our ability to attract, engage and retain subscribers to our subscription streaming services, including Paramount+, SHOWTIME OTT and BET+, and MAUs (together with subscribers, “users”) on our FAST service, Pluto TV, as well as the corresponding subscription and advertising revenues they generate, will depend on our ability to consistently provide appealing and differentiated content globally, effectively market our content and services and provide a quality experience for selecting and viewing that content. Our success will require significant investments to produce original content and acquire the rights to third-party content, including with respect to live sports, as well as the establishment and maintenance of key content and distribution partnerships.\nWe must continually add new users, convert promotional subscribers and meaningfully engage with existing subscribers to manage turnover, or “churn,” to grow our business. If we are unable to successfully compete with competitors in attracting, engaging with and retaining users as well as creative talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected. The relative service levels, content offerings, promotions and pricing and related features of our competitors’ services may adversely impact our ability to attract, engage and retain users. If consumers do not consider our streaming services to be of value compared to our competitors’ services, including because we fail to introduce attractive new content and features, do not maintain competitive pricing, terminate or modify promotional or trial period offerings, experience technical issues, or change the mix of content in a manner that is unfavorably received, we may not be able to attract, engage and retain users. If we are not able to attract new users, or our existing users decide to not continue subscriptions on our services for any reason, including a perception that they do not use our streaming services sufficiently, the need to cut household expenses, unsatisfactory content, promotions or trial-period offers expire or are modified, competitive services or promotions provide a better value or experience or customer service or technical issues are not satisfactorily resolved, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nChanges in consumer behavior, as well as evolving technologies, distribution platforms and packaging, may negatively affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur success depends on our ability to anticipate and adapt to shifting content consumption patterns. The ways in which viewers consume content, and technology and business models in our industry, continue to evolve rapidly, and new distribution platforms, as well as increased competition from new entrants and emerging technologies, have added to the complexity of maintaining predictable revenue streams.\nTechnological advancements have empowered consumers to seek more control over when, where and how they consume content and have affected the options available to advertisers for reaching target audiences. The evolution of consumer preferences toward “over-the-top” content consumption, such as streaming and other digital offerings, and the substantial increase in the availability of content without advertising or adequate methodologies for audience measurement, have had, and may continue to have, an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, consumers are increasingly using time-shifting and advertising-blocking technologies, such as DVRs, that enable users to bypass advertisements. Substantial use of\nI-22\nthese technologies could impact the attractiveness of our programming to advertisers, adversely affecting our advertising revenue.\nIn response to perceived consumer demand, distributors are continuing to develop alternative offerings, including streaming and other subscription services; advertising-supported services, including FAST; original content for mobile and social media platforms; and s\nmaller, often customizable, packages delivered by MVPDs at lower costs than traditional offerings.\nIf our networks and brands are not included in these offerings and services, or if consumers increasingly favor alternative offerings over traditional broadcast television and cable subscriptions, we may continue to experience viewership declines and ultimately demand for our programming, which could lead to lower revenues from traditional sources. These changing distribution models may also impact our ability to negotiate carriage deals on terms favorable to us.\nTo respond to these developments, we regularly adopt or develop new technologies and consider, and from time to time implement, changes to our business models and strategies to remain competitive, such as our increased investment in streaming. There can be no assurance that we will successfully anticipate or respond to these developments, that we will not experience disruption, even as we respond to such developments, or that the new technologies or business models we develop will be as successful as historic or existing ones.\nOur advertising revenues have been and may continue to be adversely impacted by changes in consumer viewership, advertising market conditions and deficiencies in audience measurement\nWe derive substantial revenues from the sale of advertising, and a decline in advertising revenues could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe evolution of consumer preferences toward over-the-top streaming and other digital services and the increasing number of entertainment choices has intensified audience fragmentation and reduced content viewership through traditional linear distribution models, which has caused and may continue to cause ratings declines for our television networks. This evolution has also given rise to new ways of purchasing advertising, as well as a general shift in total advertising expenditures toward streaming and digital, some of which may not be as beneficial to us as traditional advertising methods. Although we have increasingly focused on generating advertising revenue from our own streaming services, including Pluto TV and Paramount+ Essential, and other digital services, there can be no assurance that we can successfully navigate this shift or that the advertising revenues we generate will replace the declines in advertising revenues generated from our traditional linear business.\nThe strength of the advertising market can fluctuate in response to the economic prospects of specific advertisers or industries, advertisers’ current spending priorities and the economy in general or the economy of any individual geographic market, including the impact of the current inflationary environment and the global supply chain delays. These factors may adversely affect our advertising revenues. Natural and other disasters, pandemics, acts of terrorism, political uncertainty or hostilities could also lead to a reduction in domestic and international advertising expenditures as a result of disrupted programming and services, uninterrupted news coverage and economic uncertainty. Our ability to generate advertising revenue is also dependent on demand for our content, the consumers in our targeted demographics, advertising rates and results observed by advertisers.\nMajor sports events, such as the Super Bowl and the NCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Tournament and state, congressional and presidential elections cycles may cause our advertising revenues to vary substantially from year to year. Political advertising expenditures are impacted by the ability and willingness of candidates and political action campaigns to raise and spend funds on advertising and the competitive nature of the elections affecting viewers in markets featuring our content.\nAdvertising sales are also largely dependent on audience measurement and could be negatively affected if measurement methodologies do not accurately reflect actual viewership levels. Nielsen’s statistical sampling method is the primary measurement technique used in our television advertising sales; however, it does not fully\nI-23\nmeasure viewership across streaming and digital. We measure and monetize across over-the-top platforms based on census-based advertising-server data establishing the number of impressions served, combined with third-party data providing demographic composition estimates. Multiplatform campaign verification remains in its infancy and is still not measured by any one consistently applied method. While we expect innovation and standards around multiplatform measurement to benefit us as the advertising market continues to evolve, we are nevertheless partially dependent on third parties to deliver those solutions. Our ability to target and measure audiences is also limited by an increasing number of global laws and regulations relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal data.\nOur success depends on our ability to maintain attractive brands and\nour reputation, and to offer popular programming and other content\nOur ability to maintain attractive brands, and to create, distribute and/or license popular content are key to our success and ability to generate revenues. The revenues we generate primarily depend on our ability to consistently anticipate and satisfy consumer tastes and expectations, both in the U.S. and internationally. The popularity of our content is affected by our ability to develop and maintain strong brand awareness and a strong reputation; our ability to target key audiences; the quality and attractiveness of competing entertainment content; and the availability of alternative forms of entertainment and leisure time activities. Consumer tastes and behavior change frequently, and it is a challenge to anticipate what will be successful at any point in time. We invest substantial capital in our content, including the production of original content, before learning the extent to which it will garner critical success and popularity with consumers. A shortfall in the expected popularity of content we distribute or of sports events for which we have acquired rights, could lead to decreased profitability or losses for a significant period of time. Significant negative claims or publicity regarding the Company or its operations, content, products, management, employees, practices, business partners and culture, including individuals associated with the content we create and/or license, as well as our inability to adequately prepare for or respond to such negative claims or publicity, may damage our brands or reputation, even if such claims are untrue.\nIncreased costs for content and other rights may adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe invest significant resources to produce, market and distribute original content. We also acquire content and ancillary rights and pay related rights fees, license fees, royalties and/or contingent compensation. For example, some of the sports programming most viewed on CBS Sports or streamed on Paramount+, including NFL games, are made available based on rights of varying duration that we have negotiated with third parties. We also license various music rights from the major record companies, music publishers and performing rights organizations. Our investments in internally produced and acquired content are significant and involve complex negotiations with numerous third parties, and rapid changes in consumer behavior have increased the risk associated with the success of all kinds of content. Competition for popular content is intense, and we may have to increase the price we are willing to pay for talent and intellectual property rights, which may result in significantly increased costs. Further, increased competition in the market for development and production of original content, particularly from streaming services, increases our content costs. We may be outbid by our competitors for the rights to new, popular content or in connection with the renewals of popular rights we currently hold. As such, there can be no assurance that we will recoup our investments when the content is broadcast or distributed.\nOur businesses operate in industries that are highly competitive\nWe compete with other media companies to attract creative talent and produce high-quality content, and for distribution on a variety of third-party platforms. Competition for talent, content, audiences, subscribers, service providers, production infrastructure, advertising and distribution is intense and comes from other broadcast television networks and stations, cable networks, streaming services, the internet and social media, film studios and independent film producers and distributors, consumer products companies and other entertainment outlets and platforms, as well as from “second screen” applications. Other broadcast television networks or stations or cable networks may change their formats or programming, a new network or station may adopt a format to\nI-24\ncompete directly with our networks or stations, or networks or stations might engage in aggressive promotional campaigns. We also compete with additional entrants into the market for the production of original content and streaming services.\nOur ability to obtain widespread distribution on favorable terms, which contributes to our ability to reach audiences and, in turn, attract advertisers, is adversely affected by continued industry consolidation, including distributors and television service providers. Our competitors generally include companies with interests in multiple media businesses that are often vertically integrated, whereas our cable\nbusiness generally relies on distribution relationships with third parties. As more companies in sectors adjacent to our own create or acquire their own content, they may have significant competitive advantages, which could adversely affect our ability to negotiate favorable terms for distribution or otherwise compete effectively. Our competitors could also have preferential access to important technologies, customer data or other competitive information, as well as significant financial resources.\nThis competition and consolidation could result in lower ratings and advertising, lower affiliate and other revenues, and increased content costs and promotional and other expenses, negatively affecting our ability to generate revenues and profitability. There can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors, or that competition or consolidation in the marketplace will not have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe loss of affiliation and distribution agreements, renewal of these agreements on less favorable terms or adverse interpretations thereof could have a significant adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nA significant portion of our revenues are attributable to agreements with a limited number of distributors. These agreements generally have fixed terms that vary by market and distributor, and there can be no assurance that they will be renewed in the future, or renewed on favorable terms, including those related to pricing and programming tiers. We may also be unable to modify existing agreements with terms that have become less favorable over time. The loss of existing packaging, positioning, pricing or other marketing opportunities and the loss of carriage or the failure to renew our agreements with any distributor, or renew or modify them on favorable terms, could reduce the distribution of our programming and program services and decrease the potential audience for our programs, thereby negatively affecting our growth prospects and revenues from both affiliate fees and advertising. The CBS Network provides affiliated television stations regularly scheduled programming in return for the insertion of network commercials during that programming and the payment of reverse compensation. The loss of such station affiliation agreements could adversely affect our results of operations by reducing the reach of our programming and therefore our attractiveness to advertisers, and renewal of these affiliation agreements on less favorable terms may also adversely affect our results of operations.\nConsolidation among and vertical integration of distributors in the cable or broadcast network business has provided more leverage to these distributors and could adversely affect our ability to maintain or obtain distribution for our network programming or distribution and/or marketing of our subscription services on favorable or commercially reasonable terms, or at all. Also, consolidation among television station group owners could increase their negotiating leverage. Competitive pressures faced by MVPDs, particularly in light of the lower retail prices of streaming services, could adversely affect the terms of our renewals with MVPDs. In addition, MVPDs and streaming services continue to develop alternative offerings for consumers. To the extent these offerings do not include our content and become widely accepted in lieu of traditional offerings, we could experience a decline in affiliate revenues.\nOur revenues are dependent on the compliance of major distributors with the terms of our affiliation or distribution agreements. As these agreements have grown in complexity, the number of disputes regarding their interpretation and even their validity has grown, resulting in greater uncertainty and, from time to time, litigation with respect to our rights and obligations. Some of our distribution agreements contain “most favored nation” (“MFN”) clauses, which provide that if we enter into an agreement with a distributor and such agreement\nI-25\nincludes terms that are more favorable than those held by a distributor holding an MFN right, we must offer some of those terms to the distributor holding the MFN right. Disagreements with a distributor on the interpretation or validity of an agreement could adversely impact our affiliate and advertising revenues, as well as our relationship with that distributor.\nWe could suffer losses due to asset impairment charges for goodwill, intangible assets, FCC licenses and programming\nWe test goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including FCC licenses, for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events or circumstances require an interim impairment assessment. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in advertising markets, a decrease in audience acceptance of our programming or films, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms and/or changes in consumer behavior could result in a downward revision in the estimated fair value of a reporting unit or intangible assets, including FCC licenses, which could result in a noncash impairment charge. Any such impairment charge for goodwill, intangible assets and/or programming could have a material adverse effect on our reported net earnings.\nOur ongoing investments in new businesses, products, services and technologies, through acquisitions and other strategic initiatives, present many risks, and we may not realize intended financial and strategic goals\nWe have invested in and may continue to invest, including through acquisitions, in new businesses, products, services and technologies as part of our ongoing strategic initiatives. These initiatives, such as the integration of the CBS and Viacom businesses following the Merger, may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including: difficulty integrating acquired businesses; failure to realize anticipated benefits; unanticipated problems, expenses and liabilities; potential disruption to our business and operations; diversion of management’s attention; difficulty managing expanded operations; the loss or inability to retain key employees\n, including talent; unanticipated challenges to or loss of our relationship with new or existing customers, viewers, advertisers, suppliers, distributors, licensors;\ninsufficient revenues from such investments to offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with new investments; and failure to successfully develop an acquired business or technology. Many of these factors are outside of our control, and because new investments are inherently risky, and the anticipated benefits or value of these investments may not materialize, no assurance can be given that such investments and other strategic initiatives will not adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Business Continuity, Cybersecurity and Privacy and Data Protection\nDisruptions or failures of, or cybersecurity attacks on, our or our service providers’ networks, information systems and other technologies could result in the disclosure of confidential or valuable business or personal information, disruption of our businesses, damage to our brands and reputation, legal exposure and financial losses, and our business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address any such disruption, failure or attack\nCloud services, networks, software, information systems and other technologies we use or that are used by our third-party service providers and our product suppliers (“Providers”), including technology systems used by us and our Providers in connection with the production and distribution of our content and that otherwise perform important functions (“Systems”), are critical to our business activities. Shutdowns or disruptions of, and cybersecurity attacks on, our Systems pose increasing risks on our business. We also use content delivery networks to help us stream programming, films and other content in high volume to viewers and users of our online, mobile and app offerings over the internet. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks on our or our Providers’ networks or Systems may be caused by third-party hacking; dissemination of computer viruses, worms, malware, ransomware and other destructive or disruptive software; denial-of-service attacks and other bad acts; human error; and power outages, natural disasters, extreme weather, terrorist attacks or other similar events. Shutdowns, disruptions and attacks could have an adverse impact on us, our business partners, advertisers and other Providers,\nI-26\nemployees, viewers and users of our content, including degradation or disruption of service, loss of data and damage to equipment and data. Steps we or our Providers take to enhance, improve or upgrade networks or Systems may not be sufficient to avoid shutdowns, disruptions and attacks. Significant events could result in a disruption of our operations and reduction of our revenues, the loss of or damage to the integrity of data used by management to make decisions and operate our businesses, viewer or advertiser dissatisfaction or a loss of viewers or advertisers, and damage to our reputation or brands. In addition, our recovery and business continuity plans may prove inadequate to address any such disruption, failure or cybersecurity attack.\nWe are subject to risks caused by the misappropriation, misuse, falsification or intentional or accidental release or loss of business or personal data or programming content maintained in our or our Providers’ Systems, including proprietary and personal information (of third parties, employees and users of our online, mobile and app offerings), business information including intellectual property, or other confidential information. Outside parties may attempt to penetrate our or our Providers’ Systems or fraudulently induce employees, business partners or users of our online, mobile and app offerings to disclose sensitive or confidential information in order to gain access to our proprietary data or our subscribers’ or users’ data, our programming or our intellectual property. The number and sophistication of attempted and successful phishing, information security breaches or disruptive ransomware or denial-of-service attacks in the U.S. and elsewhere have increased significantly in recent years, and because of our prominence, we and/or Providers we use may be a particularly attractive target for such attacks. Because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access to, or disable, degrade or sabotage, networks and Systems change frequently, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate security measures or remediate flaws or detect intrusion on a timely or effective basis. Despite our efforts, the possibility of these adverse events occurring cannot be eliminated.\nIf a material breach of our networks or Systems or those of our Providers occurs, the market perception of the effectiveness of our security measures could be harmed, we could lose subscribers, viewers, revenues in the case of leaked content, advertisers and other business partners, and users of our online, mobile and app offerings; our reputation, brands and credibility could be damaged; and we could be required to expend significant amounts of money and other resources to repair, replace or recover such networks and Systems. We could also be subject to actions by regulatory authorities and claims asserted in private litigation. The costs relating to any data breach could be material, and we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate us for any losses associated with such events.\nWe are subject to complex, often inconsistent and potentially costly laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations relating to privacy and personal data protection\nWe are subject to laws, rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations in the U.S. and in other countries relating to privacy and the collection, use and security of personal data. In the E.U., for example, the GDPR mandates data protection compliance obligations and authorizes significant fines for noncompliance, requiring extensive compliance resources and efforts on our part. Further, a number of other regions where we do business have enacted or are considering new data protection regulations that may impact our business activities. In the U.S., the CCPA mandates a host of new obligations for businesses regarding how they handle the personal information of California residents. We are also subject to laws and regulations intended specifically to protect the interests of children and the privacy of minors online, including COPPA in the U.S., and more generally, the GDPR in the E.U., and we have been required to limit some functionality on digital properties as a result of these regulations. Such regulations also restrict the types of advertising we are able to sell on these digital properties and impose strict liability on us for certain of our actions, as well as certain actions of our advertisers and other third parties, which could affect advertising demand and pricing. Recently, laws in Brazil and China that govern the processing of children’s data also went into effect. These laws will likely have similar impacts to COPPA and GDPR, especially with respect to data collected in connection with advertising. Compliance with privacy and data protection rules, regulations, industry standards and contractual obligations, which may be inconsistent with one another, and noncompliance could result in regulatory investigations and enforcement, significant monetary fines, breaches of contractual obligations and private litigation. Any actual or perceived noncompliance could also lead\nI-27\nto harm to our reputation and market position. See “Business — Regulation —\nGlobal Data Protection Laws and Children’s Privacy Laws\n.”\nRisks Relating to Intellectual Property\nInfringement of our content, including digital copyright piracy and other unauthorized uses of our content, reduces revenue received from legitimate distribution of our programming, films, books and other entertainment content and adversely affects our business, financial condition and results of operations\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain and monetize our intellectual property rights. We are fundamentally a content company and infringement of our content — specifically, the infringement of our films, television programming, digital content, books and other intellectual property rights — affects the value of our content. Copyright infringement is particularly prevalent in many parts of the world that either lack effective laws and technical protection measures similar to those existing in the U.S. and Europe or lack effective enforcement of such measures, or both. Such foreign copyright infringement often creates a supply of pirated content for major markets as well. The interpretation of copyright, trademark and other intellectual property laws as applied to our content, and our infringement-detection and enforcement efforts, remain in flux, and some methods of enforcement have encountered political opposition. The failure to appropriately enforce and/or the weakening of existing intellectual property laws could make it more difficult for us to adequately protect and monetize our intellectual property and thus negatively affect its value.\nCopyright piracy is made easier by the wide availability of higher bandwidth and reduced storage costs, as well as tools that undermine encryption and other security features and enable infringers to disguise their identities online. We and our numerous production and distribution partners operate various technology systems in connection with the production and distribution of our programming and films, and intentional or unintentional acts could result in unauthorized access to our content. The continuing proliferation of digital formats and technologies heightens this risk. Internet-connected televisions, set-top boxes and mobile devices are ubiquitous, and many can support illegal retransmission platforms, illicit video-on-demand or streaming services and pre-loaded hardware, providing more accessible, versatile and legitimate-looking environments for consuming unlicensed film and television content. Unauthorized access to our content could result in the premature release of films, television programs or other content as well as a reduction in demand for authorized content, which would likely have significant adverse effects on the value of the affected content and our ability to monetize our content.\nCopyright infringement reduces the revenue that we are able to generate from the legitimate sale and distribution of our content, undermines lawful distribution channels, reduces the public’s and some affiliate partners’ perceived value of our content and inhibits our ability to recoup or profit from the costs incurred to create such content. We are actively engaged in enforcement and other activities to protect our intellectual property, and it is likely that we will continue to expend substantial resources in connection with these initiatives. Efforts to prevent the unauthorized reproduction, distribution and exhibition of our content may affect our profitability and may not be successful in preventing harm to our business.\nRisks Relating to Macroeconomic and Political Conditions\nCOVID-19 and other pandemics could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively impacted, and is expected to continue to impact, the macroeconomic environment in the U.S. and globally. In an effort to contain COVID-19 or slow its spread, governments around the world have enacted various measures, some of which have been subsequently rescinded, modified or reinstated, including travel bans, orders to close or limit access to businesses not deemed “essential,” vaccination and masking requirements, requirements to isolate residents to their homes or places of residence, and social distancing.\nThe difficult macroeconomic environment has included increased and prolonged unemployment, a decline in consumer confidence, global supply chain issues and inflation, and prolonged declines in economic\nI-28\ngrowth, as well as changes in consumer behavior in response to the pandemic, which have had, and may continue to have, a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther pandemics or widespread health emergencies may have similar effects.\nAs a result of COVID-19, in 2020 we experienced a material negative impact on our advertising revenues as a result of weakness in the advertising market, the cancellation or postponement of sporting events, and the delay of the broadcast television season as a result of production shutdowns. While the advertising market improved in 2021, we are not able to predict the effect that COVID-19 may have on the advertising market in the future and any prolonged decline in our advertising revenues would have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations. COVID-19 had a negative effect on our licensing revenues due to production shutdowns, delays in our delivery of content to third parties, and fewer original programs and live events airing on our networks. We also experienced lower demand for the licensing of our content from advertising-supported licensees. While production has resumed, we are not able to predict whether we will encounter future production delays or shutdowns or if and to what extent content licensing revenues will continue to be negatively impacted. Our theatrical revenues have been negatively impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters as a result of COVID-19. We are not able to predict the effect that COVID-19 may have on theatergoing in the future, including whether consumers will return at the same levels they previously did because of concerns related to COVID-19 or because of changes to viewing habits, or whether revenues from theatrical releases will be comparable to historical levels.\nThe magnitude of the continuing impact of COVID-19 and its variants, which could be material to our business, financial condition and results of operations, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or control, including the duration and extent of the pandemic, the impact of governmental actions, consumer behavior in response to the pandemic and such governmental actions, and economic and operating conditions in the aftermath of COVID-19. Due to the evolving and uncertain nature of the pandemic, we are not able to estimate the full extent of the impact that COVID-19 will have on our business, financial condition and results of operations, and that impact could also exacerbate the other risks described herein. Even after COVID-19 has moderated and governmental restrictions have eased, we may continue to experience the same adverse effects on our business resulting from recessionary economic conditions that persist and long-term changes in the advertising and distribution markets and consumer engagement and viewing habits.\nEconomic and political conditions in a variety of markets around the world could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur businesses operate and have audiences, customers and partners worldwide, and we are focused on expanding our international operations in key markets, some of which are emerging markets. For that reason, economic conditions in many different markets around the world affect a number of aspects of our businesses. Economic conditions in each market can also impact our audience’s discretionary spending (such as current inflation or global supply chain issues) and therefore their willingness to access our content, as well as the businesses of our partners who purchase advertising on our networks, causing them to reduce their spending on advertising. We may also be subject to longer payment cycles. In addition, as we have expanded our international operations, our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar has increased, and there is no assurance that downward trending currencies will rebound or that stable currencies will remain stable in any period. Such fluctuations could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Also, volatility and weakness in the capital markets, the tightening of credit markets or a decrease in our debt ratings could adversely affect our ability to obtain cost-effective financing. Broader supply chain delays, such as those currently impacting global distribution, may impact our business.\nOur businesses are also exposed to certain political risks inherent in conducting a global business, including retaliatory actions by governments reacting to changes in the U.S. and other countries, including in connection with trade negotiations; issues related to the presence of corruption in certain markets and enforcement of anticorruption laws and regulations; increased risk of political instability in some markets as well as conflict and\nI-29\nsanctions preventing us from accessing those markets; escalating trade, immigration and nuclear disputes; wars, acts of terrorism or other hostilities; and other political, economic or other uncertainties.\nThese political and economic risks could create instability in any of the markets where our businesses derive revenues, which could result in a reduction of revenue or loss of investment that adversely affects our businesses, financial condition or results of operations.\nRisks Relating to Regulatory and Legal Matters\nFailures to comply with or changes in U\n.\nS\n.\nor foreign laws or regulations may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations\nWe are subject to a variety of laws and regulations, both in the U.S. and/or in the foreign jurisdictions in which we or our partners operate, including laws and regulations relating to intellectual property, content regulation, user privacy, data protection, anticorruption, repatriation of profits, tax regimes, quotas, tariffs or other trade barriers, currency exchange controls, operating license and permit requirements, restrictions on foreign ownership or investment, anticompetitive conduct, export and market access restrictions, and exceptions to and limitations on copyright and censorship, among others.\nThe television broadcasting and cable programming industries in the U.S. are highly regulated by U.S. federal laws and regulations issued and administered by various federal agencies, including the FCC. For example, we are required to obtain licenses from the FCC to operate our television stations and periodically renew them. It cannot be assured that the FCC will approve our future renewal applications or that the renewals will be for full terms or will not include conditions or qualifications. The nonrenewal, or renewal with substantial conditions or modifications, of one or more of our licenses could have a material adverse effect on our revenues. We must also comply with extensive FCC limits on the ownership and operation of our television stations and our television networks, which could restrict our ability to consummate future transactions and in certain circumstances could require us to divest some television stations.\nOur businesses could be adversely affected by new laws and regulations, changes in existing laws, changes in interpretations of existing laws by courts and regulators and the threat that additional laws or regulations may be forthcoming, as well as our ability to enforce our legal rights. We could be required to change or limit certain of our business practices, which could impact our ability to generate revenues. We could also incur substantial costs to comply with new and existing laws and regulations, or substantial fines and penalties or other liabilities if we fail to comply with such laws and regulations.\nOur liabilities related to discontinued operations and former businesses could adversely impact our financial conditions\nWe have both recognized and potential liabilities and costs related to discontinued operations and former businesses, certain of which are unrelated to our existing business, including leases, guarantees, environmental liabilities, liabilities related to the pensions and medical expenses of retirees, asbestos liabilities, contractual disputes and other pending and threatened litigation. We cannot be assured that our accruals for these matters are sufficient to cover these liabilities in their entirety or any one of these liabilities when it becomes due or at what point any of these liabilities may come due. Therefore, there can be no assurances that these liabilities will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, operating performance or cash flows.\nI-30\nRisks Relating to Human Capital\nThe loss of existing or inability to hire new key employees or secure creative talent could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations\nOur business depends upon the continued efforts, abilities and expertise of our executives and other employees and the creative talent with whom we work. We compete for executives in highly specialized and evolving industries (including streaming) and our ability to attract, retain and engage such individuals may be impacted by our reputation, workplace culture, efforts with respect to DE&I and ESG matters, the compensation and benefits we provide, and our commitment to effectively managing executive succession. We also employ or contract with entertainment personalities with loyal audiences and produce films with highly regarded directors, producers, writers, actors and other creative talent in highly competitive markets. Our ability to attract and retain these individuals will similarly be impacted by our reputation, culture and efforts with respect to DE&I and ESG matters. These individuals are important to attracting viewers and the success of our programs, films and other content. There can be no assurance that these individuals will remain with us or will retain their current appeal, or that the costs associated with retaining them or new talent will be reasonable. If we fail to retain or attract new key employees or creative talent, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected.\nWe and our business partners also engage the services of writers, directors, actors, musicians and other creative talent, production crew members, trade employees, professional athletes and others who are subject to collective bargaining agreements. Any labor disputes, including lockouts, strikes or work stoppages, may disrupt our operations and cause delays in the production of our programming, which could increase our costs and have an adverse effect on our revenues, cash flows and/or operating income.\nRisks Relating to our Ownership Structure\nNAI, through its voting control of the Company, is in a position to control actions that require stockholder approval\nNAI, through its direct and indirect ownership of our Class A Common Stock, has voting control of the Company. As of December 31, 2021, NAI directly or indirectly owned approximately 77.4% of our voting Class A Common Stock and approximately 9.7% of our Class A Common Stock and non-voting Class B Common Stock on a combined basis.\nNAI is controlled by the Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Part B General Trust (the “General Trust”), which owns 80% of the voting interest of NAI and acts by majority vote of seven voting trustees (subject to certain exceptions), including with respect\nto\nthe NAI shares held by the General Trust. Shari E. Redstone, Chairperson, CEO and President of NAI and non-executive\nChair of our Board of Directors\n, is one of the seven voting trustees for the General Trust and is one of two voting trustees who are beneficiaries of the General Trust. No member of our management or other member of our Board of Directors is a trustee of the General Trust.\nNAI is in a position to control the outcome of corporate actions that require, or may be accomplished by, stockholder approval, including amending our bylaws, the election or removal of directors and transactions involving a change of control. For example, our bylaws provide that:\n•\nthe affirmative vote of not less than a majority of the aggregate voting power of all outstanding shares of our capital stock then entitled to vote generally in an election of directors, voting together as a single class, is required for our stockholders to amend, alter, change, repeal or adopt any of our bylaws;\n•\nany or all of our directors may be removed from office at any time prior to the expiration of his or her term of office, with or without cause, only by the affirmative vote of the holders of record of outstanding shares representing at least a majority of all the aggregate voting power of outstanding shares of our Common Stock then entitled to vote generally in the election of directors, voting together as a single class at a special meeting of our stockholders called expressly for that purpose; and\nI-31\n•\nin accordance with the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, our stockholders may act by written consent without a meeting if such stockholders hold the number of shares representing not less than the minimum number of votes that would be necessary to authorize or take such actions at a meeting at which all shares entitled to vote thereon were present and voted.\nAccordingly, our stockholders who may have different interests are unable to affect the outcome of any such corporate actions for so long as NAI retains voting control.\nSales of NAI’s shares of our Common Stock, some of which are pledged to lenders, could adversely affect the stock price\nBased on information received from NAI, NAI has pledged to its lenders a portion of shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock owned directly or indirectly by NAI. As of December 31, 2021, the aggregate number of shares of our Common Stock pledged by NAI to its lenders represented approximately 3.9% of the total outstanding shares of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock on a combined basis. If there is a default on NAI’s debt obligations and the lenders foreclose on the pledged shares, the lenders may not effect a transfer, sale or disposition of any pledged shares of our Class A Common Stock unless NAI and its affiliates beneficially own 50% or less of our Class A Common Stock then outstanding or such shares have first been converted into our Class B Common Stock. A sale of the pledged shares could adversely affect our Common Stock share price. In addition, there can be no assurance that at some future time NAI will not sell or pledge additional shares of our Common Stock, which could adversely affect our Common Stock share price."

During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $.96, resulting in total annual dividends of $625 million and $601 million, respectively. On December 19, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, resulting in total dividends of $150 million. Prior to Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merging with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”) (the “Merger”), Viacom and CBS each declared a quarterly cash dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2019. During the first three quarters of 2019, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.54, resulting in total dividends of $205 million. During the first three quarters of 2019, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $.60, resulting in total dividends of $245 million.\nDuring each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.4375 per share on our 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”). During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $1.5493 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021. Accordingly, we recorded dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $44.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn February 10, 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2022.  We currently expect to continue to pay a regular cash dividend to our common stockholders.

See “\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n” for details of these items and reconciliations of non-GAAP results to the most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”).\nFor 2021, revenues increased 13% to $28.59 billion from $25.29 billion in 2020, reflecting growth in all revenue streams. The increase was led by 64% higher streaming revenues, with growth across our streaming services, and an 11% increase in advertising revenues. The advertising revenue growth is principally the result of CBS’ broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LV\nand\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”) games, which contributed 9-percentage points of the increase and for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl on a rotational basis with other networks, and the 2020 NCAA Tournament was cancelled as a result of the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). Affiliate revenues grew 5%, driven by expanded distribution for our domestic cable networks and growth in fees received from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”). Licensing and other revenues also increased 5%, primarily reflecting a higher volume of licensing, including from the timing of program availabilities, partially offset by the benefit to the prior year from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\n. Theatrical revenues were up 34%, as a result of a higher number of theatrical releases in 2021, reflecting the impact on 2020 from the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19.\nOperating income for 2021 increased 52% to $6.30 billion from $4.14 billion in 2020. This comparison was impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including gains on sales in 2021 of $2.34 billion, principally reflecting gains on real estate sales of $2.23 billion; a gain on sale of $214 million in 2020; restructuring charges in each period; and in 2020, costs for other corporate matters, programming charges and impairment charges. Adjusted OIBDA decreased 13%, as revenue growth was more than offset by higher costs, principally from an increased investment in our streaming services, the timing of production as the prior year was impacted by shutdowns as a result of COVID-19, and the broadcast of noncomparable sporting events in 2021.\nFor 2021, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 90% and 79%, respectively, from 2020. These comparisons were impacted by items identified as affecting comparability, including the aforementioned items impacting operating income, and in each period, a loss on extinguishment of debt, gains from investments, and discrete tax items. Adjusted net earnings\nII-4\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nfrom continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and adjusted diluted EPS decreased 12% and 17%, respectively, reflecting lower Adjusted OIBDA partially offset by the impact in the prior year from the noncontrolling interest’s share of profit from the licensing of\nSouth Park\n. Additionally, diluted EPS and adjusted diluted EPS for 2021 were each impacted by the 2021 stock issuances discussed below, which negatively impacted reported diluted EPS by $.26 and adjusted diluted EPS by $.16.\nStock Offerings\nOn March 26, 2021, we completed offerings of 20 million shares of our Class B Common Stock at a price to the public of $85 per share and 10 million shares of 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $100 per share. The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $1.67 billion and $983 million, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. We have used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including investments in streaming.\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\nResults for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 included certain items identified as affecting comparability. Adjusted OIBDA, adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, adjusted provision for income taxes, adjusted net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS, and adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations (together, the “adjusted measures”) exclude the impact of these items and are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP. We use these measures to, among other things, evaluate our operating performance. These measures are among the primary measures used by management for planning and forecasting of future periods, and they are important indicators of our operational strength and business performance. In addition, we use Adjusted OIBDA to, among other things, value prospective acquisitions. We believe these measures are relevant and useful for investors because they allow investors to view performance in a manner similar to the method used by our management; provide a clearer perspective on our underlying performance; and make it easier for investors, analysts and peers to compare our operating performance to other companies in our industry and to compare our year-over-year results.\nBecause the adjusted measures are measures of performance not calculated in accordance with GAAP, they should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for, operating income, earnings from continuing operations before income taxes, provision for income taxes, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS or diluted EPS from continuing operations, as applicable, as indicators of operating performance. These measures, as we calculate them, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies.\nII-5\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following tables reconcile the adjusted measures to their most directly comparable financial measures in accordance with GAAP.\n(a) 2020 includes an impairment charge for FCC licenses of $25 million and accelerated depreciation of $12 million for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the merger of Viacom Inc. with and into CBS Corporation (the “Merger”).\n(b) See notes on the following tables for additional information on items affecting comparability.\n(a) Reflects severance costs associated with changes in management at certain of our businesses and the impairment of lease assets in connection with cost transformation initiatives related to the Merger.\n(b) Primarily reflects gains on the sales of CBS Studio Center, 51 West 52nd Street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of CBS (“51 West 52nd Street”), and a noncore trademark licensing operation.\n(c) Primarily reflects a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of an investment that was sold during the third quarter of 2021.\n(d) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\n(e) Primarily reflects a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our United Kingdom (“U.K.”) net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits.\n(f) The weighted average number of common shares outstanding used in the calculation of reported diluted EPS from continuing operations were 655 million and in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS from continuing operations were 646 million. These amounts differ because adjusted diluted EPS excludes the effect of the assumed conversion of our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock into shares of common stock since the impact would have been antidilutive. As a result, in the calculation of adjusted diluted EPS, the weighted average number of diluted shares outstanding does not include the assumed issuance of shares upon conversion of preferred stock, and preferred stock dividends recorded during the year ended December 31, 2021 of $44 million are deducted from net earnings from continuing operations.\nII-6\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Reflects severance, exit costs and other costs related to the Merger and a charge to write down property and equipment that was classified as held for sale.\n(b) Reflects a charge to reduce the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their fair values.\n(c) Reflects accelerated depreciation for technology that was abandoned in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\n(d) Primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19.\n(e) Reflects a gain on the sale of CNET Media Group (“CMG”).\n(f) Primarily reflects an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, Inc. (“fuboTV”), which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020.\n(g) Primarily reflects a benefit from the remeasurement of our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter of 2020.\nConsolidated Results of Operations - 2021 vs. 2020\nRevenues\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, we changed the categories we use to disaggregate revenues to include streaming revenues in order to align with management’s increased focus on this revenue stream. Streaming revenues are comprised of streaming advertising and streaming subscription revenues. Streaming advertising revenues are earned from advertisements on our pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+ and Pluto TV, and from digital video advertisements on our websites and in our video content on third-party platforms (“other digital video platforms”). Streaming subscription revenues include fees for our pay streaming services, including Paramount+, Showtime Networks’ premium subscription streaming service (“Showtime OTT”), BET+ and Noggin, as well as premium subscriptions to access certain video content on our websites. Accordingly, our advertising and affiliate revenue categories exclude revenues earned by our streaming services and on other digital video platforms. The prior year has been reclassified to conform to this presentation.\nII-7\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.\n(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.\nAdvertising\nAdvertising revenues are generated primarily from the sale of advertising spots on our global broadcast and cable networks and television stations. For 2021, the 11% increase in advertising revenues was driven by the benefit in 2021 from CBS’ broadcasts of\nSuper Bowl LV\nand NCAA Tournament games for which there were no comparable broadcasts on CBS in 2020, and an improved advertising market, driven by higher pricing and demand, compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19. We have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2021. Additionally, while we share the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament with Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. (“Turner”) each year, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament in 2020. These noncomparable sporting events contributed 9-percentage points of the advertising revenue increase for 2021. The above-mentioned increases were partially offset by lower linear impressions for our domestic networks; lower political advertising sales, reflecting the benefit to 2020 from the U.S. Presidential election; and the absence of CMG as a result of its sale in the fourth quarter of 2020, which negatively impacted the comparison by 1-percentage point.\nIn March 2021, we reached an agreement with the National Football League (“NFL”) to extend our rights to broadcast American Football Conference (AFC) regular season and post-season games, which include wildcard, divisional playoff and championship games, on the CBS Television Network and to stream these games live on Paramount+. The contract begins with the 2023 season and extends through the 2033 season, and includes the rights to the Super Bowl in 2024, 2028 and 2032, as well as certain expanded rights across our networks and platforms. The NFL has a one-time right to terminate the agreement after the 2029 season.\nIn 2022, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl and semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which will be carried by other networks, reflecting the above-mentioned rotational nature of the rights to broadcast these tentpole sporting events. However, comparability in 2022 will benefit from higher political advertising revenues, mainly in the second half of the year, driven by mid-term elections.\nAffiliate\nAffiliate revenues are principally comprised of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs” or “vMVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”), reverse compensation, and fees for authorizing the MVPDs’ and vMVPDs’ carriage of our owned television stations (“retransmission fees”). For 2021, affiliate revenues increased 5% as a result of growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues; and higher cable affiliate fees, reflecting the benefit from the launch of our basic cable networks in June 2020 and April 2021 on two vMVPDs,\nII-8\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nrate increases, and revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact of subscriber declines.\nStreaming\nFor 2021, streaming advertising revenues grew 51% driven by higher advertising on our streaming services, Pluto TV and Paramount+, as well as growth on our other digital video platforms. Global monthly active users (“MAUs”), which reflect the number of unique devices interacting with the Pluto TV service in a calendar month, increased 21.3 million to 64.4 million for December 2021 from 43.1 million for December 2020.\nStreaming subscription revenues increased 79% reflecting subscriber growth, which was led by Paramount+, which benefited from film releases, including\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie\n; new original scripted dramas, including\n1883\nand\nMayor of Kingstown\n; NFL games; and launches in international markets. Revenue growth also benefited from subscriber increases for Showtime OTT and BET+. Global streaming subscribers increased 26.2 million to 56.1 million at December 31, 2021 from 29.9 million at December 31, 2020. Global streaming subscribers include customers with access to our domestic or international streaming services, either directly through our owned and operated apps and websites, or through third-party distributors. Our subscribers include paid subscriptions and those customers registered in a free trial, and subscribers are considered unique to each of our services, whether offered individually or as part of a bundle.\nTheatrical\nTheatrical revenues are principally earned from the worldwide theatrical distribution of films through audience ticket sales. For 2021, the 34% increase in theatrical revenues reflects the benefit from current year releases including\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie,\nwhile the prior year was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19, following the release of\nSonic the Hedgehog\nin the first quarter of 2020, and throughout the remainder of the year.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third-party platforms; license fees from content produced for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services, and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; fees from the distribution of third-party programming; and revenues from the rental of production facilities. For 2021, licensing and other revenues increased 5%, reflecting a higher volume of licensing, including from the timing of program availabilities as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 because of COVID-19, and increased licensing for consumer products. These increases were partially offset by the benefit to the prior year from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\n.\nII-9\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOperating Expenses\nn/m - not meaningful\nProduction and Programming\nProduction and programming expenses reflect the amortization of costs of internally-produced television and theatrical film content; amortization of acquired program rights; and other television production costs, including on-air talent. For 2021, the increase of 24% was primarily a result of an increased investment in content for our streaming services; the timing of production, as the prior year was impacted by shutdowns as a result of COVID-19; and higher sports programming costs, principally associated with noncomparable sporting events.\nParticipations and Residuals\nParticipation and residual costs primarily include expenses relating to amounts owed to talent and other participants in our content pursuant to contractual and collective bargaining arrangements. For 2021, participation and residual costs increased 17% primarily as a result of the increase in licensing revenues in 2021 as well as the mix of titles licensed in each year.\nProgramming Charges\nDuring 2020, we recorded programming charges of $159 million primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to COVID-19.\nDistribution and Other\nDistribution and other operating expenses primarily include costs relating to the distribution of our content, including print and advertising for theatrical releases and costs paid to third-party distributors; compensation; revenue-sharing costs to television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network; and other ancillary and overhead costs associated with our operations. For 2021, the 5% increase was a result of cost increases associated with the growth of our streaming services.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSelling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses include expenses incurred for selling and marketing costs, occupancy, professional service fees and back office support, including employee compensation. The 20% increase in SG&A expenses was driven by advertising, marketing and other cost increases to support the growth\nII-10\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nand expansion of our streaming services, including the launch of Paramount+. The increase also reflects higher advertising and marketing costs to promote the increased level of original programming in 2021.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense reflects depreciation of fixed assets, including transponders and equipment under finance leases, amortization of finite-lived intangible assets, and impairment of fixed and intangible assets, when applicable. For 2020, amortization expense\nincluded an impairment charge of $25 million in the\nTV Entertainment\nsegment to write down the carrying values of FCC licenses in two markets to their fair values and accelerated depreciation of $12 million resulting from the abandonment of technology in connection with synergy plans related to the Merger.\nRestructuring and Other Corporate Matters\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded the following costs associated with restructuring and other corporate matters.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded restructuring charges of $100 million. These charges  include $65 million of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, primarily associated with changes in management at certain of our businesses. The charges also include $35 million for the impairment of lease assets that we determined we will not use and began actively marketing for sublease. This determination was made in connection with cost-transformation initiatives related to the Merger. The impairment is the result of a decline in market conditions since inception of these leases and reflects the difference between the estimated fair values, which were determined based on the expected discounted future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying values.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $542 million, associated with cost-transformation initiatives in connection with the Merger in an effort to reduce redundancies across our businesses. These charges consisted of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, as well as costs resulting from the termination of contractual obligations and charges associated with the exit of leases. In addition, in 2020 we incurred costs of $56 million in connection with the Merger, consisting of professional fees mainly associated with integration activities, as well as transaction-related bonuses. We also incurred costs of $5 million for professional fees associated with dispositions and other corporate matters, and we recorded a charge of $15 million to write down property and equipment, which was classified as held for sale in 2020, to its fair value less costs to sell.\nII-11\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Gain on Sales\nDuring 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $760 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $523 million.\nAlso in 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $1.85 billion. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain during the fourth quarter of 2021 of $1.70 billion.\nIn addition, during 2021 we recognized a pre-tax net gain of $117 million, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.\nIn 2020, we completed the sale of CMG to Red Ventures for $484 million. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $214 million.\nInterest Expense and Interest Income\nThe following table presents our outstanding debt balances, excluding finance leases, and the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nNet Gains from Investments\nFor 2021, net gains from investments primarily include a gain of $37 million on the sale of an investment and a gain of $9 million from an increase in the fair value of a marketable security that was sold during the third quarter of 2021. For 2020, net gains from investments primarily reflect an increase of $213 million in the fair value of our investment in fuboTV, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020.\nLoss on Extinguishment of Debt\nFor 2021 and 2020, we recorded losses on extinguishment of debt of $128 million and $126 million, respectively, associated with the early redemption of long-term debt of $1.99 billion for 2021 and $2.77 billion for 2020.\nII-12\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther Items, Net\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net.\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe provision for income taxes represents federal, state and local, and foreign taxes on earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and equity in loss of investee companies. For 2021, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $646 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 12.4%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a discrete tax benefit of $517 million, which includes a benefit of $260 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of the enactment during the second quarter of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 19% to 25% beginning April 1, 2023, a benefit of $229 million from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary, as well as a net tax benefit in connection with the settlement of income tax audits. The discrete tax benefit of $517 million, together with a net tax provision of $546 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, which principally include net gains on sales, reduced our effective income tax rate by 7.8 percentage points.\nFor 2020, we recorded a provision for income taxes of $535 million, reflecting an effective income tax rate of 17.0%. Included in the provision for income taxes was a discrete tax benefit of $110 million, primarily consisting of a benefit of $100 million to remeasure our U.K. net deferred income tax asset as a result of an increase in the U.K. corporate income tax rate from 17% to 19% enacted during the third quarter of 2020, as well as a tax benefit of $13 million realized in connection with the preparation of the 2019 tax returns. These items, together with a net tax benefit of $129 million on the items identified as affecting comparability in\nReconciliation of Non-GAAP Measures\n, including restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges, loss on extinguishment of debt and net gains from investments, reduced our effective income tax rate by 4.1 percentage points.\nEquity in Loss of Investee Companies, Net of Tax\nThe following table presents equity in loss of investee companies for our equity-method investments.\nFor 2021 and 2020, equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax includes impairment charges of $34 million and $9 million, respectively, relating to television joint ventures.\nII-13\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nNet Earnings Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nFor 2020,\nnet earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests primarily reflects our joint venture partners’ share of profit from the licensing of the domestic streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nto a streaming service.\nNet Earnings from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS and Diluted EPS from Continuing Operations Attributable to ViacomCBS\nFor 2021, net earnings from continuing operations attributable to ViacomCBS and diluted EPS from continuing operations increased 90% and 79%, respectively, primarily driven by the above-mentioned gains on sales of $1.75 billion, net of tax, and higher discrete tax benefits in 2021. The diluted EPS comparison also includes the effect of higher weighted average shares outstanding as a result of stock issuances in the first quarter of 2021, which negatively impacted EPS for 2021 by $.26.\nNet Earnings from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, to Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin Random House”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA (see\nLegal Matters\n). Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nThe following tables set forth details of net earnings from discontinued operations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nII-14\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a) Primarily relates to indemnification obligations for leases associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players Inc.\nSegments\nIn 2021, we operated through the following three segments:\nTV ENTERTAINMENT:\nTV Entertainment\nconsisted of the CBS Television Network, our domestic broadcast network; CBS Studios and CBS Media Ventures, the segment’s television production and syndication operations;  CBS Sports Network, CBS Sports’ 24-hour cable channel; CBS Stations, our owned broadcast television stations; and a number of streaming services, including our direct-to-consumer streaming service, Paramount+ (in the United States) and several CBS-branded streaming services, including CBS News Streaming and CBS Sports HQ.\nTV Entertainment’s\nrevenues were generated primarily from advertising; affiliate revenues, comprised of reverse compensation and retransmission fees; streaming revenues, principally comprised of advertising and subscription revenues generated by the segment’s streaming services and from digital video advertisements on our websites and in our video content on third-party platforms; and the licensing and distribution of content.\nCABLE NETWORKS:\nCable Networks\nconsisted of a portfolio of premium and basic cable networks, including Showtime, BET, Nickelodeon, MTV, Comedy Central, Paramount Network, and Smithsonian Channel; a number of direct-to-consumer streaming services, including Pluto TV, our free advertising-supported streaming television service, Showtime OTT, Noggin, and BET+; and ViacomCBS Networks International, which operates international extensions of Paramount+, Pluto TV and our\nCable Networks\nbrands and services, our international free-to-air networks (including Network 10, Channel 5 and Telefe) and ViacomCBS International Studios.\nCable Networks’\nrevenues were generated primarily from affiliate revenues, comprised of fees from MVPDs and vMVPDs for carriage of our cable networks; advertising; streaming revenues, principally comprised of advertising and subscription revenues generated by the segment’s streaming services and from digital video advertisements on our websites and in our video content on third-party platforms; and the licensing of our content and other rights.\nFILMED ENTERTAINMENT:\nFilmed Entertainment\nconsisted of Paramount Pictures, Paramount Players, Paramount Animation, Paramount Television Studios, and Miramax.\nFilmed Entertainment’s\nrevenues were generated primarily from the release or distribution of films theatrically; transactional home entertainment; the licensing of film and television product to streaming services, including Paramount+, broadcast and cable networks, and other digital services; and other ancillary activities.\nII-15\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment. Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented.\nBeginning in 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in a change to our operating segments. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will report results based on the following segments:\nTV MEDIA:\nTV Media\nconsists of our historical\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\nsegments, except that it no longer includes their corresponding direct-to-consumer streaming services (now part of our\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment) and Nickelodeon Studio (now part of our\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment), and now includes Paramount Television Studios (formerly part of our historical\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment).\nDIRECT-TO-CONSUMER:\nDirect-to-Consumer\nconsists of our portfolio of free, premium and pay streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, Showtime OTT, BET+ and Noggin.\nFILMED ENTERTAINMENT:\nFilmed Entertainment\nconsists of our historical\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment, except that it no longer includes Paramount Television Studios (now part of our\nTV Media\nsegment), and now includes Nickelodeon Studio (formerly part of our historical\nCable Networks\nsegment).\nWe present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and net gain on sales, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board guidance for segment reporting. We believe the presentation of Adjusted OIBDA is relevant and useful for investors because it allows investors to view segment performance in a manner similar to the primary method used by our management and enhances their ability to understand our operating performance. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management. Stock-based compensation is included as a component of our consolidated Adjusted OIBDA. The reconciliation of Adjusted OIBDA to our consolidated net earnings is presented in Note 19 to the consolidated financial statements.\nSegment Results of Operations - 2021 vs. 2020\nII-16\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nn/m - not meaningful\nTV Entertainment\n(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.\n(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.\nRevenues\nFor 2021, revenues increased\n21%, reflecting growth across all revenue streams, led by increased advertising revenues, including from CBS’ broadcasts of tentpole sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts in 2020, higher licensing revenues and growth at Paramount+.\nAdvertising\nThe 16%\nincrease in advertising revenues was driven by CBS’ broadcasts in 2021 of sporting events for which there were no comparable broadcasts in the prior year, including\nSuper Bowl LV\nand NCAA Tournament games.\nII-17\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe have the rights to broadcast the Super Bowl and the national semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament on a rotational basis with other networks, including in 2021. Additionally, while we share the games in the preceding rounds of the NCAA Tournament with Turner each year, COVID-19 caused the cancellation of the NCAA Tournament in 2020. The increase also reflects an improved advertising market, driven by higher pricing and demand, compared with 2020, which was negatively impacted by COVID-19, and a higher level of original programming broadcast in 2021. These increases were partially offset by lower ratings for the CBS Television Network, lower political advertising and a 2-percentage point unfavorable impact from the absence of advertising revenues from CMG, which was sold during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nIn 2022, the advertising revenue comparison will be negatively impacted by the absence of the Super Bowl and semi-finals and championship games of the NCAA Tournament, which will be carried by other networks, reflecting the above-mentioned rotational nature of the rights to broadcast tentpole sporting events. However, comparability in 2022 will benefit from higher political advertising revenues, mainly in the second half of the year, driven by mid-term elections.\nAffiliate\nAffiliate revenues increased 7%, as a result of growth in reverse compensation and retransmission fee revenues.\nStreaming\nStreaming revenues increased 70%, primarily reflecting subscriber growth at Paramount+, as well as advertising growth from Paramount+ and other digital video platforms.\nLicensing and Other\nLicensing and other revenues increased 26%, driven by the timing of program availabilities, primarily from the impact of production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19, and a higher volume of domestic licensing, including the benefit from current year licensing arrangements for\nNCIS\n,\nBull\nand several library titles. The increase also reflects higher licensing to\nCable Networks\n, driven by licensing to Pluto TV and to Paramount+ internationally. The increase was partially offset by the absence of ancillary revenues from CMG.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA decreased 42% primarily reflecting our increased investment in Paramount+, including higher content and marketing costs.\nII-18\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCable Networks\n(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.\n(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.\nRevenues\nFor 2021, revenues increased 13%, reflecting growth across all revenue streams, led by higher streaming revenues.\nAdvertising\nThe 5% increase in advertising revenues was driven by higher international advertising, reflecting an improved advertising market, which benefited from the comparison against the impact in 2020 from COVID-19, the acquisition in 2021 of Chilevisión, and the impact of foreign exchange rate changes. Taken together, the acquisition and foreign exchange rate changes contributed 2-percentage points of the growth in total advertising revenue. Domestic advertising also benefited from an improved advertising market, reflecting higher pricing and demand, but declined compared with the prior year as a result of lower linear impressions for our cable networks.\nAffiliate\nThe 3% growth in affiliate revenues was primarily driven by the benefit from the launch of our basic cable networks in June 2020 and April 2021 on two vMVPDs, increases in rates, and revenues from pay-per-view boxing events, partially offset by the impact from subscriber declines.\nStreaming\nThe 60% increase in streaming revenues was driven by advertising revenue growth from our free streaming service, Pluto TV, and other digital video platforms, as well as growth in subscribers for our subscription streaming services. Subscriber growth was driven by Showtime OTT, BET+ and our international streaming services, including the benefit from the launch of Paramount+ in several international markets.\nLicensing and Other\nThe 14% increase in licensing and other revenues was driven by higher revenues from the licensing of programming to streaming services, primarily Paramount+, and for consumer products, partially offset by the domestic licensing of\nSouth Park\nin the prior year.\nII-19\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA remained substantially flat as growth from advertising, affiliate, and streaming revenues was offset by higher content and marketing costs and lower profits from content licensing, reflecting the mix of titles licensed in each year.\nFilmed Entertainment\nRevenues\nFor 2021, revenues increased 20% reflecting growth in licensing revenues and theatrical revenues.\nTheatrical\nThe 34% increase in theatrical revenues reflects the benefit from current year releases including\nA Quiet Place Part II\nand\nPAW Patrol: The Movie\nwhile the prior year was impacted by the closure or reduced capacity of movie theaters in response to COVID-19, following the release of\nSonic the Hedgehog\nin the first quarter of 2020\n,\nand throughout the remainder of the year.\nLicensing and Other\nThe 19% increase in licensing and other revenues was driven by the licensing of current year releases, including\nComing 2 America\n,\nTom Clancy’s\nWithout Remorse\nand\nHalloween Kills\nto third parties, and\nInfinite\n,\nThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run\nand\nRumble\nto Paramount+, while licensing in the prior year was impacted by the above-mentioned impact from COVID-19.\nAdjusted OIBDA\nAdjusted OIBDA increased 71%, primarily the result of higher profits associated with the licensing of films.\nFluctuations in results for the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment may occur as a result of the timing of the recognition of distribution costs, including print and advertising, which are generally incurred before and throughout the theatrical release of a film, while the revenues for the respective film are recognized as earned through the film’s theatrical exhibition and distribution to other platforms.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nWe project anticipated cash requirements for our operating, investing and financing needs as well as cash flows expected to be generated and available to meet these needs. Our operating needs include, among other items, expenditures for content for our broadcast and cable networks and streaming services, including television and film programming, sports rights, and talent contracts, as well as advertising and marketing costs to promote our content and platforms; payments for leases, interest, and income taxes, and pension funding obligations. Our\nII-20\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ninvesting and financing spending includes capital expenditures, investments and acquisitions, share repurchases, dividends and principal payments on our outstanding indebtedness. We believe that our operating cash flows, cash and cash equivalents, borrowing capacity under our $3.50 billion Credit Facility described below, as well as access to capital markets are sufficient to fund our operating, investing and financing requirements for the next twelve months.\nOur funding for short-term and long-term obligations, including our long-term debt obligations (see Note 10), as well as our long term operating commitments, including for programming and talent (see Note 20) and lease obligations (see Note 11), will come primarily from cash flows from operating activities, proceeds from non-core asset sales, including the planned sale of Simon & Schuster described below, as well as our ability to refinance our debt. We also increased our liquidity position with the proceeds from our first quarter 2021 stock offerings described below, and the fourth quarter sales of 51 West 52nd Street for $760 million, and CBS Studio Center for $1.85 billion. Any additional cash funding requirements are financed with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and long-term debt. To the extent that commercial paper is not available to us, the Credit Facility provides sufficient capacity to satisfy short-term borrowing needs. We routinely assess our capital structure and opportunistically enter into transactions to lower our interest expense, which could result in a charge from the early extinguishment of debt.\nDuring 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell Simon & Schuster for $2.175 billion in cash, and expect to use proceeds from the sale to invest in our strategic growth priorities, including in streaming, as well as to fund dividends and pay down debt. On November 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block the sale. The purchase agreement contains commitments on the part of the purchaser to take all necessary steps to obtain any required regulatory approvals and to defend any litigation that would delay or prevent consummation, and also provides for a termination fee payable to us in certain circumstances in the event the transaction does not close for regulatory reasons (see\nLegal Matters\n).\nOn March 26, 2021, we completed offerings of 20 million shares of our Class B Common Stock at a price to the public of $85 per share and 10 million shares of 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at a price to the public and liquidation preference of $100 per share. The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $1.67 billion and $983 million, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. We have used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including investments in streaming.\nIf declared, dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly through April 1, 2024. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock accumulate from the most recent dividend payment date, and will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of 5.75% of the liquidation preference of $100 per share, payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock or through any combination of cash and shares of Class B Common Stock, at our election.\nOur access to capital markets can be impacted by factors outside our control, including economic conditions; however, we believe that our strong cash flows and balance sheet, our credit facility and our credit rating will provide us with adequate access to funding for our expected cash needs. The cost of any new borrowings are affected by market conditions and short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to access capital markets on terms and conditions that will be favorable to us.\nII-21\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $2.36 billion of remaining availability under our share repurchase program. Any share repurchases under the program are expected to be funded by cash flows from operations and, as appropriate, with short-term borrowings, including commercial paper, and/or the issuance of long-term debt.\nCash Flows\nThe changes in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash were as follows:\nOperating Activities.\nThe decrease in cash flow provided by operating activities from continuing operations was mainly driven by increased investment in our streaming services, including spending for content, advertising and marketing, and a higher level of production in 2021 as a result of production shutdowns in 2020 due to COVID-19. The decrease was partially offset by higher collections and lower payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies, as well as lower payments for income taxes. Payments for restructuring, merger-related costs and costs to achieve synergies included in cash flow provided by operating activities were $294 million and $584 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nCash paid for income taxes from continuing operations decreased to $291 million for 2021 from $411 million for 2020 primarily due to a higher volume of production incentives received, lower adjusted earnings from continuing operations before income taxes and a higher deduction associated with the exercise and vesting of stock-based compensation, partially offset by higher tax payments associated with gains from dispositions, primarily from the sale of CBS Studio Center in 2021.\nCash flow provided by operating activities from discontinued operations reflects the operating activities of Simon & Schuster.\nII-22\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nInvesting Activities\n(a) Primarily includes our investment in The CW.\n(b) Includes payments for costs to achieve synergies of $68 million and $40 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n(c) 2021 reflects the acquisitions of Chilevisión, a free-to-air television channel, and a controlling interest in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, a Spanish language content producer. 2020 primarily reflects the acquisition of Miramax, a global film and television studio.\n(d) 2021 primarily reflects proceeds received from the sales of CBS Studio Center and\n51 West 52nd Street. 2021 also includes proceeds received from the sale of our investment in fuboTV during the fourth quarter of 2020, and proceeds received from the sales of a noncore trademark licensing operation and other investments. 2020 reflects the sales of CMG and marketable securities.\nFinancing Activities\nDividends\nWe declared a quarterly cash dividend on our Class A and Class B Common Stock during each of the quarters of 2021 and 2020. During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $.96, resulting in total annual dividends of $625 million and $601 million, respectively. On December 19, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, resulting in total dividends of $150 million. Prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS each declared a quarterly cash dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2019. During the first three quarters of 2019, CBS declared total per share dividends of $.54, resulting in total dividends of $205 million. During the first three quarters of 2019, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $.60, resulting in total dividends of $245 million.\nII-23\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDuring each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.4375 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $1.5493 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021. Accordingly, we recorded dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $44.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nOn February 10, 2022, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $.24 per share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, payable on April 1, 2022. At the same time, we also declared a quarterly cash dividend of $1.4375 per share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, payable on April 1, 2022.\nCapital Structure\nThe following table sets forth our debt.\n(a)    At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the senior and junior subordinated debt balances included (i) a net unamortized discount of $466 million and $491 million, respectively, and (ii) unamortized deferred financing costs of $95 million and $107 million, respectively. The face value of our total debt was $18.27 billion at December 31, 2021 and $20.33 billion at December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $1.99 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.11 billion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $128 million.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $4.50 billion of senior notes and used the net proceeds from these issuances for the redemption of long-term debt totaling $2.77 billion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $2.88 billion, as well as for general corporate purposes. The early redemption resulted in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020 of $126 million.\nOur 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and 6.25% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus 3.895% and 3.899%, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period. In January 2022, we delivered notice that we will be calling our 5.875% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 in full on February 28, 2022.\nThe subordination, interest deferral option and extended term of the junior subordinated debentures provide significant credit protection measures for senior creditors and, as a result of these features, the debentures received a 50% equity credit by Standard & Poor’s Rating Services and Fitch Ratings Inc., and a 25% equity credit by Moody’s Investors Service, Inc.\nII-24\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe interest rate payable on our 3.45% senior notes due October 2026, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to these senior notes. The interest rate on these senior notes would increase by 0.25% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of 2.00%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes  was $124 million.\nSome of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.\nCommercial Paper\nAt both December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no outstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a $3.50 billion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Credit Facility was amended to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen with EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR-based rates, respectively, as publication of all non-USD LIBOR tenors has been discontinued after December 31, 2021. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than 4.5x (which we may elect to increase to 5.0x for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2021. On February 14, 2022, we further amended our Credit Facility to modify the definition of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio in the amended credit agreement to allow unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness through June 2024\n.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $3.50 billion.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had bank borrowings under Miramax’s $300 million credit facility, which matures in April 2023, of $35 million and $95 million, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of 3.50%.\nCritical Accounting Policies\nThe preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate these estimates,\nII-25\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nwhich are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. The result of these evaluations forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions.\nWe consider the following accounting policies to be the most critical as they are important to our financial condition and results of operations, and require significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in their application. The risks and uncertainties involved in applying our critical accounting policies are provided below. Unless otherwise noted, we applied our critical accounting policies and estimation methods consistently in all material respects and for all periods presented, and have discussed such policies with our Audit Committee. For a summary of our significant accounting policies, see the accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to be entitled to in exchange for those goods or services. Significant judgments used in the determination of the amount and timing of revenue recognition include the identification of distinct performance obligations in contracts containing bundled advertising sales and content licenses, and the allocation of consideration among individual performance obligations within these arrangements based on their relative standalone selling prices.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.\nAffiliate Revenues\n—The performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and vMVPDs, also includes a license to programming for video on demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming.\nII-26\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nContent Licensing Revenues\n—For licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film, which is based on licenses for comparable content within the marketplace. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues.\nFilm and Television Production and Programming Costs\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. The costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received. Acquired programming rights, including rights for sports programming, are expensed over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. Management’s judgment is required in estimating Ultimate Revenues and the costs to be incurred throughout the life of each television program or feature film. These estimates are used to determine the timing of amortization of capitalized production costs and expensing of participation and residual costs.\nFor television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, five years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within 10 years from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. For films intended for theatrical release, we believe the performance during the theatrical exhibition is the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of Ultimate Revenues as subsequent markets have historically exhibited a high correlation to theatrical performance. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. We also review and revise estimates of Ultimate Revenue and participation costs as of each reporting date to reflect the most current available information.\nFor acquired film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within 20 years from the date of acquisition.\nII-27\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, which includes our acquired programming rights and certain internally-produced television programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. Such estimates require management’s judgement and include consideration of factors such as expected revenues to be derived from the programming, the expected number of future airings, and, for acquired programming, the length of the license period. If initial airings are expected to generate higher revenues, an accelerated method of amortization is used. These estimates are periodically reviewed and updated based on information available throughout the contractual term or life of each program.\nFor content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the result of the impairment test indicates that the carrying value exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded for the amount of the difference. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the content within the film group is less than its amortized costs. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that have been substantively abandoned are written off.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets Impairment Test\nWe perform fair value-based impairment tests of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, comprised primarily of television FCC licenses, on an annual basis and also between annual tests if an event occurs or if circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinite-lived intangible asset below its carrying value.\nFCC Licenses\n—FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2021, we had 14 television markets with FCC license book values.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each television market that we estimate has an aggregate fair value of FCC licenses that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for 11 of our television markets. For each market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors. The market-specific factors considered include recent projections by geographic market from both independent and internal sources for revenue and operating costs, as well as average market share. We also considered the macroeconomic impact on discount rates and growth rates. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of the FCC licenses in each of these television markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test on these markets was unnecessary.\nWe performed a quantitative impairment test for the FCC licenses in the remaining three markets. The impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in two of the markets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than 20% and the fair value of the FCC license in one of the markets exceeded its carrying value of $157 million by 9%.\nThe quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding\nII-28\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ndiscounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections.\nThe estimated fair values of FCC licenses are highly dependent on the assumptions of future economic conditions in the individual geographic markets in which we own and operate television stations. Certain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, or a decline in the local television advertising marketplace could result in a downward revision to our current assumptions and judgments. Various factors may contribute to a future decline in an advertising marketplace including declines in economic conditions; an other-than-temporary decrease in spending by advertisers in certain industries that have historically represented a significant portion of television advertising revenues in that market; a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms; changes in consumer behavior; and/or a change in population size. A downward revision to the present value of future cash flows could result in impairment and a noncash charge would be required.  Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nGoodwill\n—Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level, which is an operating segment, or one level below. At December 31, 2021, we had four reporting units. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we tested two reporting units as of August 31 and two reporting units as of October 31. During the fourth quarter of 2021, to better align the timing of our annual impairment date with our budgeting cycle, we changed the date for the annual impairment test to October 31 for all reporting units. As a result, those two reporting units previously tested as of August 31 were also tested as of October 31 based on a qualitative assessment resulting in no changes to the conclusion below.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for each reporting unit that we estimate has an aggregate fair value that significantly exceed its respective carrying values. Additionally, we consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for two of our reporting units. For each of these two reporting units, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. The reporting unit specific factors that were considered included actual and expected financial performance and changes to the reporting units’ carrying amounts since the most recent impairment tests. For each industry in which the reporting units operate, we considered growth projections from independent sources and significant developments or transactions within the industry. We also determined that the impact of macroeconomic factors on the discount rates and growth rates used for the most recent impairment tests would not significantly affect the fair value of the reporting units and that the lower tax rate from a tax law change enacted since the most recent quantitative tests would positively impact the fair value of the reporting units. Based on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of these two reporting units is higher than their respective carrying amounts and therefore performing quantitative impairment tests was unnecessary.\nFor the 2021 annual impairment test, we elected to perform quantitative impairment tests for two reporting units: CBS Television and CBS Interactive, because of the amount of time that has elapsed since the previous quantitative tests. The quantitative goodwill impairment test evaluates whether the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value. For CBS Television, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values\nII-29\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nof comparable businesses (“Guideline Public Company Method”). The Discounted Cash Flow Method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. The terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. For 2021, we utilized a discount rate of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 1.5%. The Guideline Public Company Method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. The selected multiples consider each reporting unit’s relative growth, profitability, size, and risk relative to the selected publicly traded companies. For CBS Interactive, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the Guideline Public Company Method. Based on the results of the 2021 quantitative impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair value of each of the two reporting units significantly exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required.\nCertain future events and circumstances, including deterioration of market conditions, higher cost of capital, a decline in the advertising market, a shift by advertisers to competing advertising platforms, changes in consumer behavior and/or a decrease in audience acceptance of our content could result in changes to our assumptions and judgments used in the goodwill impairment tests. A downward revision of these assumptions could cause the fair values of the reporting units to fall below their respective carrying values and a noncash impairment charge would be required. Such a charge could have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nLegal Matters\nEstimates of liabilities related to legal issues and discontinued businesses, including asbestos and environmental matters, require significant judgments by management. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We continually evaluate these estimates based on changes in the relevant facts and circumstances and events that may impact estimates. While we believe that our accrual for matters related to our predecessor operations, including environmental and asbestos, are adequate, there can be no assurance that circumstances will not change in future periods. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.\nPensions\nPension benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs are calculated using many actuarial assumptions. Two key assumptions used in accounting for pension liabilities and expenses are the discount rate and expected rate of return on plan assets. The discount rate is determined based on the yield on a portfolio of high quality bonds, constructed to provide cash flows necessary to meet our pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the accumulated benefit obligation. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets. As of December 31, 2021, changes in actuarial assumptions resulted in a slight decrease to accumulated other comprehensive loss compared with the prior year-end due to an increase in\nII-30\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nthe discount rate, which was mostly offset by the unfavorable performance of pension plan assets. A 25 basis point change in the discount rate would result in an estimated change to the accumulated benefit obligation of approximately $136 million and would have an insignificant impact on 2022 pension expense. A decrease in the expected rate of return on plan assets would increase pension expense. The estimated impact of a 25 basis point change in the expected rate of return on plan assets is a change of approximately $8 million to 2022 pension expense.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in both the U.S. and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the worldwide provision for income taxes and evaluating our income tax positions.  When recording an interim worldwide provision for income taxes, an estimated effective tax rate for the year is applied to interim operating results.  In the event there is a significant or unusual item recognized in the quarterly operating results, the tax attributable to that item is separately calculated and recorded in the same quarter. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nA number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. For positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized. We evaluate our uncertain tax positions quarterly based on many factors, including, changes in tax laws and interpretations, information received from tax authorities, and other changes in facts and circumstances. Our income tax returns are routinely audited by U.S. federal and state as well as foreign tax authorities. While it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of resolution of any particular tax matter, we believe that the reserve for uncertain tax positions of $301 million at December 31, 2021 is properly recorded.\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning on February 20, 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On March 31, 2020, the Court consolidated the three lawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating\nII-31\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nEngineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. On April 14, 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 13, 2019, as amended on October 16, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On June 5, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On January 27, 2021, the Court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nBeginning on November 25, 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On January 23, 2020, the Court consolidated the four lawsuits. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. On February 28, 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI Entertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On May 22, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On December 29, 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nInvestigation-Related Matters\nAs announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained two law firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas or requests for information from the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.\nOn August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the\nII-32\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nCourt appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to court approval. All amounts payable by the Company under the settlement will be paid by the Company’s insurers.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owners\nOn September 9, 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning on or about January 1, 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly competitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among fourteen total defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. On October 8, 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the court on November 6, 2020. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to court approval.\nLitigation Related to Stock Offerings\nOn August 13, 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and on November 5, 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and 5.75% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. On December 22, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which are pending. The Complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, as well as other relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.\nLitigation Related to the Proposed Sale of Simon & Schuster\nOn November 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to block our sale of the Simon & Schuster business to Penguin Random House (the\nII-33\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n“Transaction”) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), dated November 24, 2020, between the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. The DOJ asserts that the sale of Simon & Schuster would reduce competition for the acquisition of titles. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including commitments on the part of Penguin Random House to take all necessary steps to obtain any required regulatory approvals and to defend any litigation that would delay or prevent consummation, and also provides for a termination fee payable to the Company in certain circumstances in the event the Transaction does not close for regulatory reasons. We and the other defendants believe the DOJ’s claims are without merit, and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as pending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2021, we had pending approximately 27,770 asbestos claims, as compared with approximately 30,710 as of December 31, 2020 and 30,950 as of December 31, 2019. During 2021, we received approximately 3,050 new claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately 5,990 claims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2021 and 2020 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $63 million and $35 million, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are sufficient to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.\nII-34\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOther\nFrom time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.\nMarket Risk\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and use derivative financial instruments to manage this exposure. In accordance with our policy, we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nForeign Exchange Risk\nWe conduct business in various countries outside the U.S., resulting in exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates when translating from the foreign local currency to the U.S. dollar. In order to hedge anticipated cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, foreign currency forward contracts, for periods generally up to 24 months, are used. Additionally, we designate forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions, including future production costs and programming obligations, as cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the effective portion of designated cash flow hedges are initially recorded in other comprehensive income (loss) and reclassified to the statement of operations when the hedged item is recognized. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows. The change in fair value of the non-designated contracts is included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We manage the use of foreign exchange derivatives centrally.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $1.94 billion and $1.27 billion, respectively. For 2021, $1.38 billion related to future production costs and $564 million related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2020, $740 million related to future production costs and $529 million\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nInterest Risk\nInterest rates on future long-term debt issuances are exposed to risk related to movements in long-term interest rates. Interest rate hedges may be used to modify this exposure at our discretion. There were no interest rate hedges outstanding at December 31, 2021 or 2020 but in the future we may use derivatives to manage our exposure to interest rates.\nAt December 31, 2021, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $17.66 billion and the estimated fair value was $21.5 billion. A 1% increase or decrease in interest rates would decrease or increase the fair value of our notes and debentures by approximately $1.62 billion and $2.64 billion, respectively.\nCredit Risk\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nII-35\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of\nResults of Operations and Financial Condition (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2021 or 2020, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nRelated Parties\nSee Note 8 to the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements and Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nSee Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements."

ViacomCBS Inc. and its subsidiaries’ (the “Company”) internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (a) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and disposition of assets; (b) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and (c) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nInternal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements prepared for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the framework set forth in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on this evaluation, management concluded that the Company’s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nThe effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein.\nII-38\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of ViacomCBS Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of ViacomCBS Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the related consolidated statements of operations, of comprehensive income, of stockholders’ equity, and of cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the accompanying index (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nII-39\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAmortization of Internally-Produced Television Programming Inventory that is Predominantly Monetized on an Individual Basis\nAs described in Notes 1 and 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis was $2.4 billion as of December 31, 2021. For internally-produced television programs that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, management uses an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within 10 years from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production, 5 years from the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets, and future firm commitments to license programs.\nT\nhe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to amortization of internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment by management when estimating Ultimate Revenues; this led to a high degree of auditor judgment, effort and subjectivity in performing procedures and evaluating management’s estimate of Ultimate Revenues and the significant assumptions that are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets, and future firm commitments to license programs.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to amortization of internally-produced television programming inventory that is predominantly\nII-40\nmonetized on an individual basis, including the controls over the estimation of Ultimate Revenues. These procedures also included, among others, (i) testing management’s process for estimating Ultimate Revenues, and (ii) evaluating whether the significant assumptions were reasonable considering information related to the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs. Procedures were also performed to test the completeness and accuracy of management's data used in these estimates.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 15, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s or its predecessor’s auditor since 1970.\nII-41\nVIACOMCBS INC.

References to “ViacomCBS,” the “Company,” “we,” “us” and “our” refer to ViacomCBS Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries, unless the context otherwise requires. Effective February 16, 2022, we are changing our name to Paramount Global.\nBeginning in 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that resulted in a change to our operating segments. Accordingly, beginning in the first quarter of 2022, we will report results based on the following segments:\nTV Media\n(consists of our historical\nTV Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\nsegments, except that it no longer includes their corresponding direct-to-consumer streaming services, which are now part of our\nDirect-to-Consumer\nsegment, and Nickelodeon Studio, which is now a part of our\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment, and now includes Paramount Television Studios, which was formerly part of our historical\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment);\nDirect-to-Consumer\n(consists of our portfolio of free, premium and pay streaming services, including Paramount+, Pluto TV, Showtime OTT, BET+ and Noggin); and\nFilmed Entertainment\n(consists of our historical\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment, except that it no longer includes Paramount Television Studios, which is now part of our\nTV Media\nsegment, and now includes Nickelodeon Studio, which was formerly a part of our historical\nCable Networks\nsegment).\nMerger with Viacom Inc.\n—On December 4, 2019, Viacom Inc. (“Viacom”) merged with and into CBS Corporation (“CBS”), with CBS continuing as the surviving company (the “Merger”). At the effective time of the Merger (the “Effective Time”), the combined company changed its name to ViacomCBS Inc. (“ViacomCBS”). The Merger has been accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as National Amusements, Inc. (“NAI”) was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom (and remains the controlling stockholder of ViacomCBS). Upon the closing of the Merger, the net assets of Viacom were combined with those of CBS at their historical carrying amounts and the companies have been presented on a combined basis for all periods presented in the consolidated financial statements.\nDiscontinued Operations\n—On November 25, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, which was previously reported as the\nPublishing\nsegment, to Penguin Random House LLC (“Penguin Random House”), a wholly owned subsidiary of Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA, for $\n2.175\nbillion in cash. As a result, Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented (see Note 3).\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n—The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of ViacomCBS, its subsidiaries in which a controlling interest is maintained and variable interest entities (“VIEs”) where we are considered the primary beneficiary, after the elimination of intercompany transactions. Controlling interest is\nII-47\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ndetermined by majority ownership interest and the absence of substantive third party participating rights.  Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Our proportionate share of net earnings or loss of the entity is recorded in “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nReclassifications\n—Certain amounts reported for prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year’s presentation.\nUse of Estimates\n—The preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements, and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. We base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may vary from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nBusiness Combinations\n—We generally account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, once control is obtained of a business, 100% of the assets, liabilities and certain contingent liabilities acquired, as well as amounts attributed to noncontrolling interests, are recorded at fair value. Any transaction costs are expensed as incurred. The Merger was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control as NAI was the controlling stockholder of each of CBS and Viacom.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\n—Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of purchase, including money market funds, commercial paper and bank time deposits. At December 31, 2020, we had restricted cash of $\n135\nmillion, which consisted of amounts held in grantor trusts related to agreements with former executives. Restricted cash is included within “Other current assets” and “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2020.\nProgramming Inventory\n—We produce and acquire rights to programming to exhibit on our broadcast and cable networks, direct to consumers through our streaming services, on our broadcast television stations, and in theaters. We also produce programming for third parties. Costs for internally-produced and acquired programming inventory, including prepayments for such costs, are recorded within the non-current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Prepayments for the rights to air sporting and other live events that are expected to be expensed over the next 12 months are classified within the current portion of “Programming and other inventory” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCosts incurred to produce television programs and feature films (which include direct production costs, production overhead, acquisition costs and development costs) are capitalized when incurred and amortized over the projected life of each television program or feature film. Costs incurred to acquire television series and feature film programming rights, including advances, are capitalized when the license period has begun and the program is accepted and available for airing and amortized over the shorter of the license period or the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived.\nFor internally-produced television programs and feature films that are predominantly monetized on an individual basis, we use an individual-film-forecast computation method to amortize capitalized production costs and to accrue estimated liabilities for participations and residuals over the applicable title’s life cycle based upon the ratio of current period revenues to estimated remaining total gross revenues to be earned (“Ultimate Revenues”) for each title. The estimate of Ultimate Revenues impacts the timing of amortization of capitalized production\nII-48\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncosts and expensing of participations and residual costs. For television programming, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues to be earned within\n10\nyears from the delivery of the first episode, or, if still in production,\nfive years\nfrom the delivery of the most recent episode, if later. These estimates are based on the past performance of similar television programs in a market, the performance in the initial markets and future firm commitments to license programs.\nFor feature films, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues includes revenues from all sources that are estimated to be earned within\n10\nyears from the date of a film’s initial release. Prior to the release of feature films, we estimate Ultimate Revenues based on the historical performance of similar content and pre-release market research (including test market screenings), as well as factors relating to the specific film, including the expected number of theaters and markets in which the original content will be released, the genre of the original content and the past box office performance of the lead actors and actresses. Upon a film’s initial release, we update our estimate of Ultimate Revenues based on actual and expected future performance. Our estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships to theatrical performance and an analysis of current market trends. For acquired television and film libraries, our estimate of Ultimate Revenues is for a period within\n20\nyears from the date of acquisition. Ultimate Revenue estimates are periodically reviewed and adjustments, if any, will result in changes to inventory amortization rates and estimated accruals for residuals and participations.\nFilm development costs that have not been set for production are expensed within\nthree years\nunless they are abandoned earlier, in which case these projects are written down to their estimated fair value in the period the decision to abandon the project is determined.\nFor programming that is predominantly monetized as part of a film group, which includes our acquired programming rights and certain internally-produced television programs, capitalized costs are amortized based on an estimate of the timing of our usage of and benefit from such programming. The costs of programming rights licensed under multi-year sports programming agreements are capitalized if the rights payments are made before the related economic benefit has been received and amortized over the period in which an economic benefit is expected to be derived based on the relative value of the events broadcast by us during a period in relation to the estimated total value of the events over the term of the sports programming agreement.\nFor content that is predominantly monetized on an individual basis, a television program or feature film is tested for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that its fair value may be less than its unamortized cost. If the carrying value of a film group or individual television program or feature film exceeds the estimated fair value, an impairment charge will then be recorded in the amount of the difference. Content that is predominantly monetized within a film group is assessed for impairment at the film group level and would similarly be tested for impairment if circumstances indicate that the fair value of the content within the film group is less than its amortized costs. In addition, unamortized costs for internally-produced or acquired programming that have been substantively abandoned are written off.\nTelevision and feature film programming and production costs, including inventory amortization, development costs, residuals and participations and impairment charges, if any, are included within “Operating expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nII-49\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nProperty and Equipment\n—Property and equipment is stated at cost.\nDepreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as follows:\nCosts associated with repairs and maintenance of property and equipment are expensed as incurred.\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets\n—The Company assesses long-lived assets and intangible assets, other than goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives, for impairment whenever there is an indication that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable.  Recoverability of these asset groups is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these asset groups to their net carrying value. If the carrying value is not recoverable, the amount of impairment charge, if any, is measured by the difference between the net carrying value and the estimated fair value of the assets.\nInvestments\n—Investments over which we have a significant influence, without a controlling interest, are accounted for under the equity method. Equity investments for which we have no significant influence are measured at fair value where a readily determinable fair value exists. Equity investments that do not have a readily determinable fair value are measured at cost less impairment, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes. Gains and losses resulting from changes in the fair value of equity investments are recorded in “Net gains from investments” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. We monitor our investments for impairment and reduce the carrying value of the investment if we determine that an impairment charge is required based on qualitative and quantitative information. Our investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\n—Goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are at or one level below our operating segments. Intangible assets with finite lives, which primarily consist of trade names, licenses, and customer agreements are generally amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives, which range from\n4\nto\n40\nyears. Goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, which consist primarily of FCC licenses, are not amortized but are tested for impairment on an annual basis and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value below its carrying amount. If the carrying value of goodwill or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized\n(see Note 6).\nGuarantees\n—At the inception of a guarantee, we recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed by issuing the guarantee. The related liability is subsequently reduced as utilized or extinguished and increased if there is a probable loss associated with the guarantee which exceeds the value of the recorded liability.\nTreasury Stock\n—Treasury stock is accounted for using the cost method. Retirements of treasury stock are reflected as a reduction to additional paid-in capital.\nFair Value Measurements\n—Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. The framework for measuring fair value provides a hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or\nII-50\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nliability. Certain assets and liabilities, including foreign currency hedges and deferred compensation liabilities, are measured and recorded at fair value on a recurring basis. Other assets and liabilities, including television and film production costs, goodwill, intangible assets, and equity-method investments are recorded at fair value only if an impairment charge is recognized. Impairment charges, if applicable, are generally determined using discounted cash flows, which is a Level 3 valuation technique.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\n—Derivative financial instruments are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as assets or liabilities and measured at fair value. For derivatives designated as hedges of the fair value of assets or liabilities, the changes in fair value of both the derivatives and the hedged items are recorded in “Other items, net”\non the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the derivatives is recorded in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss\n”\non the Consolidated Balance Sheets and subsequently recognized in net earnings when the hedged items are recognized.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\n—The service cost component of net benefit cost for our pension and postretirement benefits is recorded on the same line items on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as other compensation costs of the related employees. All of the other components of net benefit cost are presented separately from the service cost component and below the subtotal of operating income in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nOther Liabilities\n—Other liabilities consist primarily of the noncurrent portion of residual liabilities of previously disposed businesses, long-term income tax liabilities, deferred compensation and other employee benefit accruals.\nRevenues\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service is transferred to a customer. Control is considered to be transferred when the customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits of that good or service.\nAdvertising Revenues\n—Advertising revenues are recognized when the advertising spots are aired on television or streamed or displayed on digital platforms. Advertising spots are typically sold as part of advertising campaigns consisting of multiple commercial units. If a contract includes a guarantee to deliver a targeted audience rating or number of impressions, the delivery of the advertising spots that achieve the guarantee represents the performance obligation to be satisfied over time and revenues are recognized based on the proportion of the audience rating or impressions delivered to the total guaranteed in the contract. Audience ratings and impressions are determined based on data provided by independent third-party companies. To the extent the amounts billed exceed the amount of revenue recognized, such excess is deferred until the guaranteed audience ratings or impressions are delivered. For contracts that do not include impressions guarantees, the individual advertising spots are the performance obligation and consideration is allocated among the individual advertising spots based on relative standalone selling price.  Advertising contracts, which are generally short-term, are billed monthly, with payments due shortly after the invoice date.\nII-51\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAffiliate Revenues\n—Affiliate revenues primarily consist of fees received from multichannel video programming distributors (“MVPDs”) and third-party live television streaming services (“virtual MVPDs”, or “vMVPDs”) for carriage of our cable networks (“cable affiliate fees”) and television stations (“retransmission fees”); and fees from television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“reverse compensation”). Costs incurred for advertising, marketing and other services provided to us by cable, satellite and other distributors that are in exchange for a distinct service are recorded as expenses. If a distinct service is not received, such costs are recorded as a reduction to revenues.\nThe performance obligation for our affiliate agreements is a license to our programming provided through the continuous delivery of live linear feeds and, for agreements with MVPDs and vMVPDs, also includes a license to programming for video-on-demand viewing. Affiliate revenues are recognized over the term of the agreement as we satisfy our performance obligation by continuously providing our customer with the right to use our programming. For agreements that provide for a variable fee, revenues are determined each month based on an agreed upon contractual rate applied to the number of subscribers to\nour customer’s service. For agreements that provide for a fixed fee, revenues are recognized based on the relative fair value of the content provided over the term of the agreement. These agreements primarily include agreements with television stations affiliated with the CBS Television Network (“network affiliates”) for which fair value is determined based on the fair value of the network affiliate’s service and the value of our programming. For affiliate revenues, payments are generally due monthly.\nLicensing and Other Revenues\n—Licensing and other revenues are principally comprised of fees from the licensing of the rights to exhibit our internally-produced television and film programming on various platforms in the secondary market after its initial exhibition on our owned or third party platforms; license fees from content produced for third parties; home entertainment revenues, which include revenues from the viewing of our content on a transactional basis through transactional video-on-demand (TVOD) and electronic sell-through services, and the sale and distribution of our content through DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesale and retail partners; fees from the use of our trademarks and brands for consumer products, recreation and live events; fees from the distribution of third-party programming; and revenues from the rental of production facilities.\nFor licenses of exhibition rights for internally-produced programming, each individual episode or film delivered represents a separate performance obligation and revenues are recognized when the episode or film is made available to the licensee for exhibition and the license period has begun. For license agreements that include delivery of content on one or more dates for a fixed fee, consideration is allocated based on the relative standalone selling price of each episode or film. Estimation of standalone selling prices requires judgment, which can impact the timing of recognizing revenues. Agreements to license programming are often long term, with collection terms ranging from\none\nto\nfive years\n.\nWhen payment is due from a customer more than one year before or after revenue is recognized, we consider the contract to contain a significant financing component and the transaction price is adjusted for the effects of the time value of money. We do not adjust the transaction price for the time value of money if payment is expected within one year of recognizing revenues.\nWe also license our programming to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and similar services. Under these arrangements, our performance obligation is the delivery of our content to such distributors who then license our content to the end customer. Our revenues are determined each month based on a contractual rate applied to the number of licenses to the distributors’ end customers. Similarly, revenues earned from electronic sell-through services are recognized as each program is downloaded by the end customer.\nII-52\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenues associated with the licensing of our brands for consumer products, recreation and live events are generally determined based on contractual royalty rates applied to sales reported by the licensees. For consumer products and recreation arrangements that include minimum guaranteed consideration, revenue is recognized as sales occur by the licensee, if the sales-based consideration is expected to exceed the minimum guarantee, or ratably if it is not expected to exceed the minimum guarantee. For live events, we recognize revenue when the event is held.\nRevenues from the sales of DVDs and Blu-ray discs to wholesalers and retailers are recognized upon the later of the physical delivery to the customer or the date that any sales restrictions on the retailers are lifted.\nWe earn revenues from the distribution of content on behalf of third parties. We also have arrangements for the distribution or sale of our content by third parties. Under such arrangements, we determine whether revenues should be recognized based on the gross amount of consideration received from the customer or the net amount of revenue we retain after payment to the third party producer or distributor, based on an assessment of which party controls the good or service being transferred.\nTheatrical Revenues\n—Theatrical revenue is earned from the theatrical distribution of our films during the exhibition period. Under these arrangements, revenues are recognized based on sales to the end customer.\nRevenue Allowances\n—DVDs and Blu-ray discs are generally sold with a right of return. We record a provision for sales returns and allowances at the time of sale based upon an estimate of future returns, rebates and other incentives. In determining this provision, we consider sources of qualitative and quantitative evidence including forecast sales data, customers’ rights of return, sales levels for units already shipped, historical return rates for similar products, current economic trends, the competitive environment, promotions and our sales strategies. Reserves for sales returns and allowances of $\n36\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are recorded in “Other current liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nReserves for accounts receivable reflect our expected credit losses, which are estimated based on historical experience, as well as current and expected economic conditions and industry trends. Our allowance for doubtful accounts was $\n80\nmillion and $\n85\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The provision for doubtful accounts charged to expense was $\n8\nmillion in 2021, $\n32\nmillion in 2020 and $\n25\nmillion in 2019.\nContract Liabilities\n—A contract liability is recorded when consideration is received from a customer prior to fully satisfying a performance obligation in a contract. Our contract liabilities primarily consist of cash received related to advertising arrangements for which the required audience rating or impressions have not been delivered; consumer products arrangements with minimum guarantees; and content licensing arrangements under which the content has not yet been made available to the customer. These contract liabilities will be recognized as revenues when control of the related product or service is transferred to the customer. Contract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCollaborative Arrangements\n—Collaborative arrangements primarily consist of joint efforts with third parties to produce and distribute programming such as television series and live sporting events, including the agreement between us and Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. to telecast the\nNCAA Division I Men’s Basketball Championship\n(the “NCAA Tournament”), which runs through 2032. In connection with this agreement for the NCAA Tournament, advertisements aired on the CBS Television Network are recorded as revenues and our share of the program rights fees and other operating costs are recorded as operating expenses.\nII-53\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nWe also enter into collaborative arrangements with other studios to jointly finance and distribute film and television programming, under which each partner is responsible for distribution of the program in specific territories or distribution windows. Under these arrangements, co-production costs are initially capitalized as programming inventory and amortized over the estimated economic life of the program. In such arrangements where we have distribution rights, all proceeds generated from such distribution are recorded as revenues and any participation profits due to third party collaborators are recorded as participation expenses. In co-production arrangements where third party collaborators have distribution rights, our net participating profits are recorded as revenues.\nAmounts attributable to transactions arising from collaborative arrangements between participants were not material to the consolidated financial statements for any period presented.\nLeases\n—We have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities and finance leases for satellite transponders and equipment. We determine that a contract contains a lease if we obtain substantially all of the economic benefits of, and the right to direct the use of, an asset identified in the contract. For leases with terms greater than 12 months, we record a right-of-use asset and a lease liability representing the present value of future lease payments. The discount rate used to measure the lease asset and liability is determined at the beginning of the lease term using the rate implicit in the lease, if readily determinable, or our collateralized incremental borrowing rate. For those contracts that include fixed rental payments for both the use of the asset (“lease costs”) as well as for other occupancy or service costs relating to the asset (“non-lease costs”), we generally include both the lease costs and non-lease costs in the measurement of the lease asset and liability. We also own buildings and production facilities where we lease space to lessees.\nOur leases generally have remaining terms ranging from\none\nto\n15\nyears and often contain renewal options to extend the lease for periods of generally up to\n10\nyears. For leases that contain renewal options, we include the renewal period in the lease term if it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. Lease expense and income for our operating leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with the exception of variable lease costs, which are expensed as incurred, and leases of assets used in the production of programming, which are capitalized in programming assets and amortized over the projected useful life of the related programming. For finance leases, amortization of the right-of-use asset is recognized in amortization expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term and interest expense is accreted on the lease liability using the effective interest method. This results in an accelerated recognition of cost over the lease term\n.\nAdvertising\n—Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.\nWe incurred total advertising expenses of $\n2.14\nbillion in 2021, $\n1.31\nbillion in 2020 and $\n1.67\nbillion in 2019.\nInterest\n—Costs associated with the refinancing or issuance of debt, as well as debt discounts or premiums, are recorded as interest over the term of the related debt.\nIncome Taxes\n—The provision for income taxes includes federal, state, local, and foreign taxes. We recognize the tax on global intangible low-taxed income, a U.S. tax on certain income earned by our foreign subsidiaries, as a period cost when incurred within the provision for income taxes.\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and their respective tax basis. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the year in which the temporary differences are expected to be reversed. We evaluate the realizability of deferred tax assets and establish a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized. Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are classified as noncurrent on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nII-54\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor tax positions taken in a previously filed tax return or expected to be taken in a future tax return, we evaluate each position to determine whether it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained upon examination, based on the technical merits of the position. A tax position that meets the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold is subject to a measurement assessment to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Operations and the appropriate reserve to establish, if any. If a tax position does not meet the more-likely-than-not recognition threshold, a tax reserve is established and no benefit is recognized.  A number of years may elapse before a tax return containing tax matters for which a reserve has been established is audited and finally resolved. We recognize interest and penalty charges related to the reserve for uncertain tax positions as income tax expense.\nForeign Currency Translation and Transactions\n—Assets and liabilities of subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the United States (“U.S.”) Dollar are translated into U.S. Dollars at foreign exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date, while results of operations are translated at average foreign exchange rates for the respective periods. The resulting translation gains and losses are included as a separate component of stockholders’ equity in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Argentina has been designated as a highly inflationary economy during all periods presented. Transactions denominated in currencies other than the functional currency will result in remeasurement gains and losses, which are included in “Other items, net” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nNet Earnings per Common Share\n—Basic net earnings per share (“EPS”) is based upon net earnings available to common stockholders divided by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.  Net earnings available to common stockholders is calculated as net earnings from continuing operations or net earnings, as applicable, adjusted to include preferred stock dividends recorded during the period.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded dividends of $\n44.2\nmillion on the\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock”) that was issued during the first quarter of 2021 (see Note 14).\nWeighted average shares for diluted EPS reflects the effect of the assumed exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock units (“RSUs”) or performance stock units (“PSUs”) only in the periods in which such effect would have been dilutive. Diluted EPS also reflects the effect of the assumed conversion of preferred stock, if dilutive, which includes the issuance of common shares in the weighted average number of shares and excludes the above-mentioned preferred stock dividend adjustment to net earnings available to common stockholders.\nExcluded from the calculation of diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been antidilutive, were stock options and RSUs of\n6\nmillion,\n22\nmillion and\n19\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe table below presents a reconciliation of weighted average shares used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nII-55\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nStock-based Compensation\n—We measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award. The cost is recognized over the vesting period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nSimplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\nOn January 1, 2021, we adopted Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance on the accounting for income taxes that, among other provisions, eliminates certain exceptions to existing guidance related to the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes in an interim period and the recognition of deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences. This guidance also requires an entity to reflect the effect of an enacted change in tax laws or rates in its effective income tax rate in the interim period that includes the enactment date. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nReference Rate Reform\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued guidance providing optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by the discontinuation of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or by another reference rate expected to be discontinued. The one-week and two-month USD LIBOR tenors and all non-USD LIBOR tenors have been discontinued after December 31, 2021, with the remaining USD LIBOR tenors ceasing after June 30, 2023. The guidance is effective immediately upon issuance and an entity may elect to apply it to contract modifications or hedging relationships entered into on or before December 31, 2022, with a few exceptions for certain hedging relationships existing as of December 31, 2022. This guidance, which primarily affects certain of our debt and hedging arrangements, is being applied as modifications of contracts that include LIBOR occur. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we amended our $\n3.50\nbillion revolving credit facility (the “Credit Facility”) to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen with EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR-based rates, respectively. The application of this guidance did not have and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nAccounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nAccounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity\nOn August 5, 2020, the FASB issued amended guidance to reduce complexity associated with the accounting for convertible instruments with characteristics of liabilities and equity. Under this guidance, embedded conversion features associated with convertible instruments no longer need to be separated from the host contracts unless they are required to be accounted for as derivatives or have been issued at a substantial premium. For contracts in an entity’s own equity, this guidance removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exceptions. This guidance also amends certain EPS guidance for convertible instruments and expands disclosure requirements. This guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, with early adoption permitted, and is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n2)\nACQUISITIONS\nDuring 2021, we made payments totaling $\n54\nmillion, net of cash acquired, for the acquisition of Chilevisión, a free-to-air television channel, and a controlling interest in Fox TeleColombia & Estudios TeleMexico, a Spanish\nII-56\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nlanguage content producer. The results of these companies are included in the\nCable Networks\nsegment from the dates of acquisition.\nDuring 2020, we acquired a\n49\n% interest in Miramax, a global film and television studio, for $\n375\nmillion, which included a cash payment at closing of approximately $\n150\nmillion along with a commitment to invest $\n45\nmillion annually, beginning on the first anniversary of the closing and continuing through 2025, to be used for new film and television productions and working capital. In conjunction with this acquisition, we entered into commercial agreements with Miramax under which we have exclusive, long-term distribution rights to Miramax’s catalog, which added more than\n700\ntitles to our existing library. We also have certain rights to co-produce, co-finance and/or distribute new film and television projects. The investment is accounted for as a consolidated VIE. We are the primary beneficiary of the VIE due to our power to direct the distribution of Miramax’s films and television series, which is considered the most significant activity of the VIE. The results of Miramax are included in the\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegment from the date of acquisition.\nDuring 2019, we acquired Pluto Inc., the provider of Pluto TV, a leading free streaming television service in the U.S., for $\n324\nmillion, net of cash acquired, as well as the remaining\n50\n% interest in Pop TV, a general entertainment cable network, for $\n39\nmillion, net of cash acquired, which brought our ownership to\n100\n%. The results of Pluto TV and Pop TV are included in the\nCable Networks\nsegment from the date of acquisition.\nThe operating results of these acquisitions were not material to our consolidated financial statements in the year of acquisition.\n3)\nDISPOSITIONS\nDuring October 2021, we completed the sale of 51 West 52nd Street, an office tower that was formerly the headquarters of CBS, to Harbor Group International, LLC, for $\n760\nmillion. At closing, we executed an agreement to lease back the space we occupy for terms ranging from\ntwo\nto\nthree years\n. This transaction resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n523\nmillion.\nIn December 2021, we completed the sale of CBS Studio Center to a partnership formed by Hackman Capital Partners, LLC and Square Mile Capital Management, LLC for $\n1.85\nbillion. At closing, we executed a\n10\n-year lease-back of the portion of a building on the property that is used by our Los Angeles television stations. The lease-back began at the time of the sale and includes an option to terminate one floor without penalty beginning on the fifth anniversary. The sale resulted in a pre-tax gain of $\n1.70\nbillion.\nIn addition, during 2021 we recognized a pre-tax net gain of $\n117\nmillion, principally relating to the sale of a noncore trademark licensing operation.\nOn November 25, 2020, we entered into an agreement to sell our publishing business, Simon & Schuster, to Penguin Random House for $\n2.175\nbillion in cash. Simon & Schuster is presented as a discontinued operation in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented. On November 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice filed suit to block the sale. The purchase agreement contains commitments on the part of the purchaser to take all necessary steps to obtain any required regulatory approvals and to defend any litigation that would delay or prevent consummation, and also provides for a termination fee payable to us in certain circumstances in the event the transaction does not close for regulatory reasons (see Note 20).\nII-57\nVIACOMCBS INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table presents amortization of television and film programming and production costs.\nProgramming Charges\nIncluded in the table above for the year ended December 31, 2020, are programming charges of $\n159\nmillion primarily related to the abandonment of certain incomplete programs resulting from production shutdowns related to the coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). Programming charges of $\n101\nmillion, $\n53\nmillion and $\n5\nmillion are included within the\nTV Entertainment,\nCable Networks\nand\nFilmed Entertainment\nsegments, respectively.\nDuring 2019, in connection with the Merger, we implemented management changes across the organization. In connection with these changes, we performed an evaluation of our programming portfolio across all of our businesses, including an assessment of the optimal use of our programming in the marketplace, which resulted in the identification of programs not aligned with management’s strategy. As a result, we recorded programming charges of $\n589\nmillion principally reflecting accelerated amortization associated with changes in the expected monetization of certain programs, and decisions to cease airing, alter future airing patterns or not renew certain programs.\nThe programming charges for 2020 and 2019 were included within “Operating expenses” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nII-60\nVIACOMCBS INC.

FCC licenses are tested for impairment at the geographic market level. We consider each geographic market, which is comprised of all of our television stations within that geographic market, to be a single unit of accounting because the FCC licenses at this level represent their highest and best use. At December 31, 2021, we had\n14\ntelevision markets with FCC license book values.\nFor our annual impairment test, we perform qualitative assessments for the reporting units and television markets with FCC licenses that we estimate have fair values that significantly exceed their respective carrying values. In making this determination, we also consider the duration of time since a quantitative test was performed. For the 2021 annual impairment test, we performed qualitative assessments for\n11\nof our television markets and\ntwo\nof our\nreporting units. For each reporting unit, we weighed the relative impact of factors that are specific to the reporting unit as well as industry and macroeconomic factors. For each television market, we weighed the relative impact of market-specific and macroeconomic factors.\nBased on the qualitative assessments, considering the aggregation of the relevant factors, we concluded that it is not more likely than not that the fair values of these reporting units and the fair value of FCC licenses within each of these markets are less than their respective carrying values. Therefore, performing a quantitative impairment test was unnecessary.\nFor the 2021 annual test for FCC licenses, we performed a quantitative impairment test for the remaining\nthree\nmarkets. The quantitative impairment test of FCC licenses calculates an estimated fair value using the Greenfield Discounted Cash Flow Method, which values a hypothetical start-up station in the relevant market by adding discounted cash flows over a five-year build-up period to a residual value. The assumptions for the build-up period include industry projections of overall market revenues; the start-up station’s operating costs and capital expenditures, which are based on both industry and internal data; and average market share. The discount rate is determined based on the industry and market-based risk of achieving the projected cash flows, and the residual value is calculated using a long-term growth rate, which is based on projected long-range inflation and industry projections. The impairment tests indicated that the estimated fair values of FCC licenses in two of the markets exceeded their respective carrying values by more than\n20\n% and the fair value of the FCC license in one of the markets exceeded its carrying value of $\n157\nmillion by\n9\n%.\nII-61\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nFor the 2021 annual test for goodwill, we elected to perform quantitative impairment tests for\ntwo\nreporting units, CBS Television and CBS Interactive, because of the amount of time that has elapsed since the previous quantitative tests. For CBS Television, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the present value of future cash flows (“Discounted Cash Flow Method”) and the traded or transaction values of comparable businesses (“Guideline Public Company Method”). The Discounted Cash Flow Method requires us to make various assumptions regarding the timing and amount of future cash flows, including growth rates, operating margins and capital expenditures for a projection period, plus the terminal value of the business at the end of the projection period. The assumptions about future cash flows are based on our internal forecasts of the reporting unit, which incorporates our long-term business plans and historical trends. The terminal value is estimated based on a perpetual nominal growth rate, which is based on historical and projected inflation and economic indicators, as well as industry growth projections. A discount rate is determined for the reporting unit based on the risks of achieving the future cash flows, including risks applicable to the industry and market as a whole, as well as the capital structure of comparable entities. The Guideline Public Company Method incorporates revenue and earnings multiples from publicly traded companies with operations and other characteristics similar to each reporting unit. For CBS Interactive, we estimated the fair value of the reporting unit based on the Guideline Public Company Method. Based on the results of the 2021 quantitative impairment tests, we concluded that the estimated fair value of each of the two reporting units exceeded their respective carrying values and therefore no impairment charge was required.\nFor the 2021 annual goodwill impairment test, we tested two reporting units as of August 31 and two reporting units as of October 31. During the fourth quarter of 2021, to better align the timing of our annual impairment date with our budgeting cycle, we changed the date for the annual impairment test to October 31 for all reporting units. As a result, those two reporting units previously tested as of August 31 were also tested as of October 31 based on a qualitative assessment resulting in no changes to the conclusion above.\nII-62\nVIACOMCBS INC.

These charges  include $\n65\nmillion of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, primarily associated with changes in management at certain of our businesses. The charges also include $\n35\nmillion for the impairment of lease assets that we determined we will not use and began actively marketing for sublease. This determination was made in connection with cost-transformation initiatives related to the Merger. The impairment is the result of a decline in market conditions since inception of these leases and reflects the difference between the estimated fair values, which were determined based on the expected discounted future cash flows of the lease assets, and the carrying values.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded restructuring charges of $\n542\nmillion, associated with cost-transformation initiatives in connection with the Merger in an effort to reduce redundancies across our businesses. These charges consisted of severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, as well as costs resulting from the termination of contractual obligations and charges associated with the exit of leases.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recorded restructuring charges of $\n418\nmillion, primarily for severance costs, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, in connection with the Merger, as well as costs related to a restructuring plan initiated in the first quarter of 2019 under which severance payments were provided to certain eligible employees who voluntarily elected to participate. These charges also included costs related to the termination of contractual obligations and charges associated with the exit of leases.\nThe following is a rollforward of our restructuring liability, which is recorded in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The majority of the restructuring liability at December 31, 2021, which primarily relates to severance payments, is expected to be paid by the end of 2022.\nII-65\nVIACOMCBS INC.

We also incurred costs of $\n5\nmillion for professional fees associated with dispositions and other corporate matters, and we recorded a charge of $\n15\nmillion to write down property and equipment, which was classified as held for sale in 2020, to its fair value less costs to sell.\nIn 2019, in addition to the above-mentioned restructuring charges, we incurred costs of $\n294\nmillion in connection with the Merger, consisting of financial advisory, legal and other professional fees, transaction-related bonuses, and contractual executive compensation, including the accelerated vesting of stock-based compensation, that was triggered by the Merger. We also incurred costs of $\n40\nmillion in connection with the settlement of a commercial dispute and $\n17\nmillion associated with legal proceedings involving the Company (see Note 20) and other corporate matters.\n8)\nRELATED PARTIES\nNational Amusements, Inc.\nNational Amusements, Inc.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2021, and for all comparable prior-year periods, these categories include streaming revenues, which aligns with management’s increased focus on this revenue stream. Streaming revenues are comprised of streaming advertising and streaming subscription revenues. Streaming advertising revenues are earned from advertisements on our pay and free streaming services, including Paramount+ and Pluto TV, and from digital video advertisements on our websites and in our video content on third-party platforms (“other digital video platforms”). Streaming subscription revenues include fees for our pay streaming services, including Paramount+, Showtime OTT, BET+ and Noggin, as well as premium subscriptions to access certain video content on our websites. Accordingly, our advertising and affiliate revenue categories exclude revenues earned by our streaming services and on other digital video platforms.\n(a) Excludes streaming advertising revenues.\n(b) Excludes streaming subscription revenues.\nReceivables\nIncluded in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are noncurrent receivables of $\n1.84\nbillion and $\n2.02\nbillion at\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncurrent receivables primarily relate to revenues recognized under long-term content licensing arrangements. Revenues from the licensing of content are recognized at the beginning of the license period in which programs are made available to the licensee for exhibition, while the related cash is generally collected over the term of the license period.\nOur receivables do not represent significant concentrations of credit risk at December 31, 2021 or 2020, due to the wide variety of customers, markets and geographic areas to which our products and services are sold.\nContract Liabilities\nContract liabilities are included within “Deferred revenues” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and were $\n1.20\nbillion, $\n1.12\nbillion and $\n908\nmillion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized revenues of $\n877\nmillion, $\n591\nmillion, and $\n498\nmillion, respectively, that were included in the opening balance of deferred revenues for the respective year.\nII-67\nVIACOMCBS INC.

These amounts only include contracts subject to a guaranteed fixed amount or the guaranteed minimum under variable contracts, primarily consisting of television and film licensing contracts and affiliate agreements that are subject to a fixed or guaranteed minimum fee. Such amounts change on a regular basis as we renew existing agreements or enter into new agreements. Unrecognized revenues under contracts disclosed above do not include (i) contracts with an original expected term of one year or less, mainly consisting of advertising contracts (ii) contracts for which variable consideration is determined based on the customer’s subsequent sale or usage, mainly consisting of affiliate agreements and (iii) long-term licensing agreements for multiple programs for which variable consideration is determined based on the value of the programs delivered to the customer and our right to invoice corresponds with the value delivered.\nPerformance Obligations Satisfied in Previous Periods\nUnder certain licensing arrangements, the amount and timing of our revenue recognition is determined based on our licensees’ subsequent sale to its end customers. As a result, under such arrangements, we often satisfy our performance obligation of delivery of our content in advance of revenue recognition. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized revenues of $\n424\nmillion, $\n383\nmillion, and $\n294\nmillion, respectively, for licensing to distributors of transactional video-on-demand and electronic sell-through services and other arrangements for licensing of our content for which our performance obligation was satisfied in a prior period.\nII-68\nVIACOMCBS INC.

The face value of our total debt was $\n18.27\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n20.33\nbillion at December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we redeemed senior notes totaling $\n1.99\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.11\nbillion resulting in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n128\nmillion.\nII-69\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued $\n4.50\nbillion of senior notes and used the net proceeds from these issuances for the redemption of long-term debt totaling $\n2.77\nbillion, prior to maturity, for an aggregate redemption price of $\n2.88\nbillion, as well as for general corporate purposes. The early redemption resulted in a pre-tax loss on extinguishment of debt for the year ended December 31, 2020\nof $\n126\nmillion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we issued $\n500\nmillion of\n4.20\n% senior notes due 2029. We used the net proceeds from this issuance in the redemption of our $\n600\nmillion outstanding\n2.30\n% senior notes due August 2019. During 2019, we also repaid the $\n220\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n5.625\n% senior notes due September 2019 and the $\n90\nmillion aggregate principal amount of our\n2.75\n% senior notes due December 2019.\nOur\n5.875\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 and\n6.25\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 accrue interest at the stated fixed rates until February 28, 2022 and February 28, 2027, respectively, on which dates the rates will switch to floating rates based on three-month LIBOR plus\n3.895\n% and\n3.899\n%, respectively, reset quarterly. These debentures can be called by us at any time after the expiration of the fixed-rate period. In January 2022, we delivered notice that we will be calling our\n5.875\n% junior subordinated debentures due February 2057 in full on February 28, 2022.\nThe interest rate payable on our\n3.45\n% senior notes due October 2026, will be subject to adjustment from time to time if Moody’s Investor Services, Inc. or S&P Global Ratings downgrades (or downgrades and subsequently upgrades) the credit rating assigned to these senior notes. The interest rate on these senior notes would increase by\n0.25\n% upon each credit agency downgrade up to a maximum of\n2.00\n%, and would similarly be decreased for subsequent upgrades. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding principal amount of these senior notes was $\n124\nmillion.\nSome of our outstanding notes and debentures provide for certain covenant packages typical for an investment grade company. There is an acceleration trigger for the majority of the notes and debentures in the event of a change in control under specified circumstances coupled with ratings downgrades due to the change in control, as well as certain optional redemption provisions for our junior debentures.\nAt December 31, 2021, our scheduled maturities of long-term debt at face value, excluding finance leases, and the related interest payments were as follows:\nCommercial Paper\nAt both December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had\nno\noutstanding commercial paper borrowings.\nCredit Facility\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a $\n3.50\nbillion revolving credit facility with a maturity in January 2025 (the “Credit Facility”). The Credit Facility is used for general corporate purposes and to support commercial paper borrowings, if any. We may, at our option, also borrow in certain foreign currencies up to specified limits under the Credit Facility. Borrowing rates under the Credit Facility are determined at the time of each borrowing and are generally based on either the prime rate in the U.S. or an applicable benchmark rate plus a margin (based on our senior unsecured debt rating), depending on the type and tenor of the loans entered. During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Credit Facility was amended to replace LIBOR as the benchmark rate for loans denominated in euros, sterling and yen with EURIBOR, SONIA and TIBOR-based rates, respectively, as publication of all non-USD\nII-70\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLIBOR tenors has been discontinued after December 31, 2021. The Credit Facility has one principal financial covenant that requires our Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio to be less than\n4.5\nx (which we may elect to increase to\n5.0\nx for up to four consecutive quarters following a qualified acquisition) at the end of each quarter. The Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio reflects the ratio of our Consolidated Indebtedness at the end of a quarter, to our Consolidated EBITDA (each as defined in the amended credit agreement) for the trailing twelve-month period. We met the covenant as of December 31, 2021. On February 14, 2022, we further amended our Credit Facility to modify the definition of the Consolidated Total Leverage Ratio in the amended credit agreement to allow unrestricted cash and cash equivalents to be netted against Consolidated Indebtedness through June 2024\n.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and the remaining availability under the Credit Facility, net of outstanding letters of credit, was $\n3.50\nbillion.\nOther Bank Borrowings\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had bank borrowings under Miramax’s $\n300\nmillion credit facility, which matures in April 2023, of $\n35\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion, respectively, with a weighted average interest rate of\n3.50\n%.\n11)\nLEASES\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the following amounts were recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets relating to our leases.\nII-71\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nLessee Contracts\nWe have operating leases primarily for office space, equipment, satellite transponders and studio facilities. We also have finance leases for satellite transponders and equipment. Lease costs are generally fixed, with certain contracts containing variable payments for non-lease costs based on usage and escalations in the lessors’ annual costs.\nThe following table presents our lease cost.\n(a) Includes fixed lease costs and non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) associated with long-term operating leases.\n(b) Includes costs capitalized in programming assets during the period for leased assets used in the production of programming.\n(c) Short-term leases, which are not recorded in right-of-use assets and lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, have a term of 12 months or less and exclude month-to-month leases.\n(d) Primarily includes non-lease costs (consisting of other occupancy and service costs relating to the use of an asset) and costs for equipment leases that vary based on usage.\nThe following table presents supplemental cash flow information related to our leases.\nII-72\nVIACOMCBS INC.

Lease payments received under these agreements consisted of fixed payments for the rental of space and certain building operating costs, as well as variable payments based on usage of production facilities and services, and escalating costs of building operations. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed the sales of a production facility and an office building, and as a result our future expected fixed lease income is not material (see Note 3).\n12)\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe carrying value of our financial instruments approximates fair value, except for notes and debentures.  At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the carrying value of our outstanding notes and debentures was $\n17.66\nbillion and $\n19.61\nbillion, respectively, and the fair value, which is determined based on quoted prices in active markets (Level 1 in the fair value hierarchy) was $\n21.5\nbillion and $\n24.5\nbillion, respectively.\nInvestments\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had investments of $\n627\nmillion and $\n601\nmillion, respectively, consisting of equity-method investments and equity investments without a readily determinable fair value. These investments are included in “Other assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We contributed $\n193\nmillion\n,\n$\n59\nmillion and $\n171\nmillion to our investments during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOur equity-method investments include a\n50\n% interest in the broadcast network, The CW, as well as interests in several international television joint ventures including a\n49\n% interest in Viacom18, a joint venture in India which owns and operates COLORS pay television channel. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, we had $\n568\nmillion and $\n536\nmillion of equity-method investments. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, “Equity in loss of investee companies, net of tax” on the Consolidated Statements of Operations includes impairment charges of $\n34\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively, relating to television joint ventures.\nThe carrying value of our investments without a readily determinable fair value for which we have no significant\nII-73\nVIACOMCBS INC.

For 2020, “Net gains from investments” of $\n206\nmillion reflects a gain of $\n213\nmillion related to an increase in the value of our investment in fuboTV, which was sold in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by an impairment of investments without a readily determinable fair value of $\n7\nmillion. For 2019, “Net gains from investments” of $\n85\nmillion reflects an unrealized gain of $\n113\nmillion resulting from increases in the fair value of marketable securities, which were sold in 2020, and gains of $\n22\nmillion on the sale and acquisition of joint ventures, partially offset by an impairment charge of $\n50\nmillion to write down an investment to its fair value.\nIn February 2022, we closed on an agreement with Comcast to form a joint venture to launch SkyShowtime, a new subscription streaming service that is expected to be available in more than 20 European territories and will include premium and original content from both parent companies. The partnership, which is owned and controlled equally by us and Comcast, is accounted for under the equity method.\nForeign Exchange Contracts\nWe use derivative financial instruments primarily to manage our exposure to market risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. We do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and, therefore, we do not hold or enter into derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes.\nForeign exchange forward contracts have principally been used to hedge projected cash flows in currencies such as the British Pound, the Euro, the Canadian Dollar and the Australian Dollar, generally for periods up to\n24\nmonths. We designate foreign exchange forward contracts used to hedge committed and forecasted foreign currency transactions as cash flow hedges. Additionally, we enter into non-designated forward contracts to hedge non-U.S. dollar denominated cash flows.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the notional amount of all foreign currency contracts was $\n1.94\nbillion and $\n1.27\nbillion, respectively. For 2021, $\n1.38\nbillion related to future production costs and $\n564\nmillion\nrelated to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows. For 2020, $\n740\nmillion related to future production costs and $\n529\nmillion related to our foreign currency balances and other expected foreign currency cash flows.\nGains (losses) recognized on derivative financial instruments were as follows:\nThe fair value of our derivative instruments was not material to the Consolidated Balance Sheets for any of the periods presented.\nWe continually monitor our positions with, and credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to our financial instruments. We are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the agreements. However, we do not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties.\nII-74\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n13)\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nCertain of our assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis.\nThe table below presents our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These assets and liabilities have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB, which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. Level 1 is based on publicly quoted prices for the asset or liability in active markets. Level 2 is based on inputs that are observable other than quoted market prices in active markets, such as quoted prices for the asset or liability in inactive markets or quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. Level 3 is based on unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability. All of our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis use level 2 inputs. The fair value of foreign currency hedges is determined based on the present value of future cash flows using observable inputs including foreign currency exchange rates. The fair value of deferred compensation liabilities is determined based on the fair value of the investments elected by employees.\n14)\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nIn general, the Company’s Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock have the same economic rights; however, holders of the Company’s Class B Common Stock do not have any voting rights, except as required by law. Holders of the Company’s Class A Common Stock are entitled to one vote per share with respect to all matters on which the holders of the Company’s Common Stock are entitled to vote.\nMerger with Viacom\nAt the Effective Time of the Merger, (1) each share of Viacom Class A Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into\n0.59625\nshares of our Class A Common Stock, and (2) each share of Viacom Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, other than shares held directly by Viacom as treasury shares or held by CBS, was converted automatically into\n0.59625\nshares of our Class B Common Stock, resulting in the issuance of\n29\nmillion shares of our Class A Common Stock and\n211\nmillion shares of our Class B Common Stock. At the Effective Time, each share of CBS Class A Common Stock and each share of CBS Class B Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the Effective Time, remained an issued and outstanding share of our Class A Common Stock and our Class B Common Stock, respectively, and was not affected by the Merger.\nII-75\nVIACOMCBS INC.

The net proceeds from the Class B Common Stock offering and the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock offering were approximately $\n1.67\nbillion and $\n983\nmillion, respectively, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses. We have used and intend to continue to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including investments in streaming.\nMandatory Convertible Preferred Stock\nUnless earlier converted, each share of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically and mandatorily convert on the mandatory conversion date, expected to be April 1, 2024, into between\n1.0013\nand\n1.1765\nshares of our Class B Common Stock, subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments. The number of shares of Class B Common Stock issuable upon conversion will be determined based on the average of the volume-weighted average price per share of our Class B Common Stock over the\n20\nconsecutive trading day period commencing on, and including, the\n21\nst scheduled trading day immediately preceding April 1, 2024. Holders of the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock (“Holders”) have the right to convert all or any portion of their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at any time prior to April 1, 2024 at the minimum conversion rate of\n1.0013\nshares of our Class B Common Stock. In addition, the conversion rate applicable to such an early conversion may, in certain circumstances, be increased to compensate Holders for certain unpaid accumulated dividends. However, if a fundamental change (as defined in the Certificate of Designations governing the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock) occurs on or prior to April 1, 2024, then Holders will, in certain circumstances, be entitled to convert all or a portion of their shares of Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock at an increased conversion rate for a specified period of time and receive an amount to compensate them for unpaid accumulated dividends and any remaining future scheduled dividend payments.\nThe Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock is not redeemable. However, at our option, we may purchase or otherwise acquire (including in an exchange transaction) the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock from time to time in the open market, by tender or exchange offer or otherwise, without the consent of, or notice to, Holders. Holders have no voting rights, with certain exceptions.\nIf declared, dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock are payable quarterly through April 1, 2024. Dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock accumulate from the most recent dividend payment date, and will be payable on a cumulative basis when, as and if declared by our Board of Directors, or an authorized committee thereof, at an annual rate of\n5.75\n% of the liquidation preference of $\n100\nper share, payable in cash or, subject to certain limitations, by delivery of shares of Class B Common Stock or through any combination of cash and shares of Class B Common Stock, at our election. If we have not declared any portion of the accumulated and unpaid dividends by April 1, 2024, the conversion rate will be adjusted so that Holders receive an additional number of shares of our Class B Common Stock, with certain limitations.\nII-76\nVIACOMCBS INC.

During each of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we declared total per share dividends of $\n.96\n, resulting in total annual dividends of $\n625\nmillion and $\n601\nmillion, respectively. On December 19, 2019, we declared a quarterly cash dividend of $\n.24\nper share on our Class A and Class B Common Stock, resulting in total dividends of $\n150\nmillion. Prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS each declared a quarterly cash dividend during each of the first three quarters of 2019.

During the first three quarters of 2019, Viacom declared total per share dividends of $\n.60\n, resulting in total dividends of $\n245\nmillion.\nDuring each of the third and fourth quarters of 2021, we declared quarterly cash dividends of $\n1.4375\nper share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock. During the second quarter of 2021, we declared a cash dividend of $\n1.5493\nper share on our Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock, representing a dividend period from March 26, 2021 through July 1, 2021. Accordingly, we recorded dividends on the Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock of $\n44.2\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nTreasury Stock\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $\n2.36\nbillion of authorization remaining under our share repurchase program. During 2021, we did not repurchase any shares of our common stock. During 2020, we repurchased\n1.3\nmillion shares of our Class B Common Stock under our share repurchase program for $\n50\nmillion, at an average cost of $\n38.63\nper share. During 2019, we repurchased\n1.2\nmillion shares of our Class B Common Stock under our share repurchase program for $\n50\nmillion, at an average cost of $\n40.78\nper share.\nIn the Merger, all shares of Viacom Class B Common Stock held by Viacom as treasury stock were canceled and recorded to additional paid-in-capital.\nConversion Rights\nHolders of Class A Common Stock have the right to convert their shares to Class B Common Stock as long as there are at least\n5,000\nshares of Class A Common Stock outstanding. Conversions of Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were\n11.6\nmillion for 2021 and\n12.2\nmillion for 2019. For 2020, conversions of Class A Common Stock into Class B Common Stock were minimal.\nII-77\nVIACOMCBS INC.

The purpose of the Plans is to benefit and advance the interests of our company by attracting, retaining and motivating participants and to compensate participants for their contributions to the financial success of our company. The Plans provide for awards of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted and unrestricted shares, RSUs, dividend equivalents, performance awards and other equity-related awards. RSUs and PSUs accrue dividends each time we declare a quarterly cash dividend, which are paid upon vesting when the shares are delivered and are forfeited if the award does not vest. Upon exercise of stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs, we issue new shares from our existing authorization. At December 31, 2021, there were\n38\nmillion shares available for future grant under the Plans. Stock-based compensation awards were also granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans until December 31, 2020. Upon exercise of outstanding stock options or vesting of RSUs and PSUs previously granted under Viacom’s equity incentive plans, shares may be issued from Viacom’s previous authorization or from treasury stock.\nII-78\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAt the Effective Time of the Merger, each RSU for Viacom Class B common stock was converted into\n0.59625\nRSUs for the Company’s Class B Common Stock and each outstanding stock option for Viacom Class B common stock was converted into\n0.59625\noptions for the Company’s  Class B common stock. The exercise price of stock options was adjusted by dividing the exercise price of the Viacom stock options by\n0.59625\n. At the Effective Time of the Merger, all outstanding PSU awards for which the performance period had not been completed were converted into time-based RSUs based on the target number of shares included in the terms of the original PSU award. RSU and stock option information is presented herein as if Viacom and CBS had been combined for or all periods presented, unless otherwise noted.\nThe following table summarizes stock-based compensation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n(a) Reflects accelerations as a result of restructuring activities, as well as accelerations triggered by the Merger in 2019.\nIncluded in net earnings from discontinued operations was stock-based compensation expense of $\n3\nmillion, $\n10\nmillion, and $\n5\nmillion for the years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nRSUs and PSUs\nCompensation expense for RSUs is determined based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, which is generally a\none\n- to\nfour-year\nservice period. Certain RSU awards are also subject to satisfying internal performance conditions. Compensation expense is recorded based on the probable outcome of the internal performance conditions and subsequently adjusted to the actual outcome of the performance condition. Forfeitures for RSUs are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust compensation expense based on actual forfeitures and on an annual basis we revise the forfeiture rate as necessary.\nDuring 2021 and 2020, we also granted PSU awards. The number of shares to be issued upon vesting of these PSUs is based on the total shareholder return of the Company’s Class B Common Stock measured against the companies comprising the S&P 500 Index over a designated measurement period, and for certain 2021 awards is also based on the achievement of established operating goals. The fair value of PSU awards with a market condition is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Compensation expense for PSUs is expensed over the required employee service period. The fair value of the PSU awards granted during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n3\nmillion and $\n34\nmillion, respectively. There were\nno\nPSU awards granted in 2019.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of RSUs and PSUs granted was $\n35.80\n,\n$\n32.35\nand $\n41.71\nin 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The total market value of RSUs and PSUs that vested during 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n260\nmillion, $\n222\nmillion and $\n159\nmillion, respectively. Total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RSUs and PSUs at December 31, 2021 was $\n199\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n2.3\nyears.\nII-79\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table summarizes our RSU and PSU share activity:\nStock Options\nCompensation expense for stock options is determined based on the grant date fair value of the award calculated using the Black-Scholes options-pricing model. Stock options generally vest over a\nthree\n- to\nfour-year\nservice period and expire\neight years\nfrom the date of grant. Forfeitures are estimated on the date of grant based on historical forfeiture rates. We adjust the compensation expense based on actual forfeitures.\nThere were\nno\nstock option grants during 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested stock option awards at December 31, 2021 was $\n3\nmillion, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n0.8\nyears.\nThe following table summarizes our stock option activity under the Plans.\nThe following table summarizes other information relating to stock option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAt December 31, 2021, stock options outstanding and exercisable have a weighted average remaining contractual life of\n2.60\nyears and\n2.40\nyears, respectively. There was\nno\nintrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable, based on our closing stock price of $\n30.18\nat December 31, 2021.\nII-80\nVIACOMCBS INC.

The tax benefit relating to losses from equity investments was $\n49\nmillion in 2021 and $\n19\nmillion in both 2020 and 2019, which represented an effective tax rate of\n35.0\n%,\n40.4\n% and\n26.4\n% for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nII-81\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe difference between income taxes expected at the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate of 21% and the provision (benefit) for income taxes is summarized as follows:\n(a) For 2021, reflects a tax benefit from the recognition of a capital loss associated with a change in the tax entity classification of a foreign subsidiary. For 2019, reflects a deferred tax benefit resulting from the transfer of intangible assets between our subsidiaries in connection with a reorganization of our international operations. The related deferred tax asset is primarily expected to be realized over a 25-year period.\n(b) Reflects tax benefits realized in connection with the preparation of the 2018 federal tax return, based on further clarity provided by the United States government on tax positions relating to the Tax Reform Act.\nThe following table summarizes the components of deferred income tax assets and liabilities.\nIn addition to the amounts reflected in the table above, included in “Assets of discontinued operations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets are net deferred income tax assets of $\n80\nmillion and $\n93\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nII-82\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nAt December 31, 2021, we had deferred income tax assets for federal foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n40\nmillion and net operating loss carryforwards for federal, state and local, and foreign jurisdictions of approximately $\n282\nmillion, the majority of which expire in various years from 2022 through 2039.\nThe 2021 and 2020 deferred income tax assets were reduced by a valuation allowance of $\n581\nmillion and $\n593\nmillion, respectively, principally relating to income tax benefits from capital losses and net operating losses in foreign jurisdictions which are not expected to be realized.\nGenerally, the future remittance of foreign undistributed earnings will not be subject to U.S. federal income taxes and as a result, for substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries, we do not intend to assert indefinite reinvestment of both cash held outside of the U.S. and future cash earnings. However, a future repatriation of cash could be subject to state and local income taxes, foreign income taxes, and withholding taxes. Accordingly, we recorded deferred income tax liabilities associated with future repatriations, which were not material to the consolidated financial statements. Additional income taxes have not been provided for outside basis differences inherent in these entities, which could be recognized upon sale or other transaction, as these amounts continue to be indefinitely invested in foreign operations. The determination of the U.S. federal deferred income tax liability for such outside basis difference is not practicable.\nThe following table sets forth the change in the reserve for uncertain tax positions, excluding related accrued interest and penalties.\nThe reserve for uncertain tax positions of $\n301\nmillion at December 31, 2021 includes $\n271\nmillion which would affect our effective income tax rate, including discontinued operations, if and when recognized in future years. We recognized interest and penalties of $\n14\nmillion, $\n16\nmillion and $\n24\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have recorded liabilities for accrued interest and penalties of $\n56\nmillion and $\n57\nmillion, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nII-83\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe Company and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and local and foreign jurisdictions. For periods prior to the Merger, Viacom and CBS filed separate tax returns. For CBS, we are currently under examination by the IRS for the 2017 and 2018 tax years. For Viacom, the Company and the IRS settled the income tax audit for the 2014 and 2015 tax years during the second quarter of 2021. The IRS commenced its examination of Viacom’s 2016 through 2019 tax years in November 2021. Various tax years are also currently under examination by state and local and foreign tax authorities. With respect to open tax years in all jurisdictions, we currently do not believe that it is reasonably possible that the reserve for uncertain tax positions will significantly change within the next 12 months; however, it is difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of resolution of any particular tax matter and events could cause our current expectation to change in the future.\n17)\nPENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nThe Company and certain of its subsidiaries sponsor qualified and non-qualified defined benefit pension plans, principally non-contributory, covering eligible employees. Our pension plans consist of both funded and unfunded plans. The majority of participants in these plans are retired employees or former employees of previously divested businesses. In November 2020, our remaining defined benefit pension plans subject to benefit accruals, which were sponsored by CBS prior to the Merger, were amended to freeze future benefit accruals and benefits were enhanced under defined contribution plans that were previously sponsored by CBS, both of which are effective January 1, 2021. As a result of the pension plan amendments, a curtailment gain of $\n79\nmillion associated with the elimination of benefit accruals for future services of the impacted employees was reflected in unrecognized actuarial loss included within “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the year ended December 31, 2020. Plan benefits  are based primarily on an employee’s years of service and  pay for each year that the employee participated in the plan. We fund our pension plans in accordance with the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (“ERISA”), the Pension Protection Act of 2006, the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and other applicable law, rules and regulations. Plan assets consist principally of corporate bonds, equity securities, common collective trust funds, U.S. government securities and short-term investments. The Company’s Common Stock represented approximately\n1.5\n% and\n1.8\n% of the fair value of plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn addition, the Company sponsors health and welfare plans that provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits to eligible retired employees and their covered dependents. Eligibility is based in part on certain age and service requirements at the time of their retirement. Most of the plans are contributory and contain cost-sharing features such as deductibles and coinsurance which are adjusted annually, as well as caps on the annual dollar amount we will contribute toward the cost of coverage. Claims and premiums for which we are responsible are paid with our own funds.\nThe pension plan disclosures herein include information related to our domestic pension and postretirement benefit plans only, unless otherwise noted. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Consolidated Balance Sheets also include a liability of $\n53\nmillion and $\n77\nmillion, respectively, in “Pension and postretirement benefit obligations” relating to our non-U.S. pension plans and certain other retirement severance plans.\nWe use a December 31 measurement date for all pension and other postretirement benefit plans.\nII-84\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following table sets forth the change in benefit obligation for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe actuarial gain of $\n45\nmillion, included in the change in benefit obligation for pension benefits in 2021, was driven by a\n30\nbasis point increase in the discount rate from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021.\nThe following table sets forth the change in plan assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans.\nThe funded status of pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related amounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were as follows:\nOur qualified pension plans were underfunded by $\n655\nmillion and $\n712\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nII-85\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nThe following amounts were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n4.91\nbillion and $\n5.16\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInformation for the pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets is set forth below.\nThe following tables present the components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in other comprehensive income (loss).\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\n(b) Includes amounts reflected in net earnings from discontinued operations of $\n3\nmillion for 2021, $\n5\nmillion for 2020 and $\n6\nmillion for 2019\n.\nThe service cost component of net periodic cost is presented on the Consolidated Statements of Operations within operating income. All other components of net periodic cost are presented below operating income, in “Other items, net.”\nII-86\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nN/A - not applicable\nThe discount rates are determined primarily based on the yield of a portfolio of high quality bonds, providing cash flows necessary to meet the pension plans’ expected future benefit payments, as determined for the projected benefit obligations. The expected return on plan assets assumption is derived using the current and expected asset allocation of the pension plan assets and considering historical as well as expected returns on various classes of plan assets.\nThe following additional assumptions were used in accounting for postretirement benefits.\nII-87\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nPlan Assets\nThe ViacomCBS Investments Committee (the “Committee”) determines the strategy for the investment of pension plan assets. The Committee establishes target asset allocations for our pension plan trusts based upon an analysis of the timing and amount of projected benefit payments, projected company contributions, the expected returns and risk of the asset classes and the correlation of those returns. The target asset allocation for the Company’s domestic pension plans is to invest between\n60\n% -\n68\n% in liability hedging assets,\n22\n% -\n30\n% in equity securities,\n3\n% -\n10\n% in real estate and real assets and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents and other investments. At December 31, 2021, the trusts were invested approximately\n60\n% in liability hedging assets,\n29\n% in equity securities,\n7\n% in real estate and real assets, and the remainder in cash, cash equivalents and other investments. Liability hedging assets consist of a diversified portfolio of fixed income instruments that are substantially investment grade, with a duration that approximates the duration of the liabilities covered by the trust. All equity portfolios are diversified between U.S. and non-U.S. equities and include large and small capitalization equities. The asset allocations are reviewed regularly.\nThe following tables set forth our pension plan assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020. These assets have been categorized according to the three-level fair value hierarchy established by the FASB which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value. See Note 13 for a description of the levels within this hierarchy. There are no investments categorized as Level 3.\nII-88\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\n(a)  Assets categorized as Level 2 reflect investments in money market funds.\n(b) On January 3, 2022, the trust that held the assets of the Viacom pension plan was merged into the trust that holds the assets of the remainder of ViacomCBS' domestic plans. As part of this merger, certain of the transferred assets were liquidated, which resulted in a higher level of cash and cash equivalents at December 31, 2021.\n(c)  Securities of diverse sectors and industries, substantially all investment grade.\n(d)  In accordance with FASB guidance investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as a practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy.\n(e)  Underlying investments consist mainly of U.S. large capitalization and international equity securities.\nMoney market investments are carried at amortized cost which approximates fair value due to the short-term maturity of these investments. Investments in equity securities are reported at fair value based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges. The fair value of investments in common collective funds and mutual funds is determined using the net asset value (“NAV”) provided by the administrator of the fund as a practical expedient. The NAV is determined by each fund’s trustee based upon the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, less liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding units. The fair value of U.S. treasury securities is determined based on quoted market prices in active markets. The fair value of government related securities and corporate bonds is determined based on quoted market prices on national security exchanges, when available, or using valuation models which incorporate certain other observable inputs including recent trading activity for comparable securities and broker quoted prices. The fair value of mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities is based upon valuation models which incorporate available dealer quotes, projected cash flows and market information. The fair value of limited partnerships has been estimated using the NAV of the ownership interest. The NAV is determined using quarterly financial statements issued by the partnership which determine the value based on the fair value of the underlying investments.\nFuture Benefit Payments\nEstimated future benefit payments are as follows:\nII-89\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nIn 2022, we expect to make\nno\ncontributions to our qualified pension plans for minimum funding requirements under ERISA and $\n74\nmillion to our non-qualified pension plans to satisfy benefit payments due under these plans. Also in 2022, we expect to contribute approximately $\n40\nmillion to our other postretirement benefit plans to satisfy our portion of benefit payments due under these plans.\nMultiemployer Pension and Postretirement Benefit Plans\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees including talent, writers, directors, producers and other employees, primarily in the entertainment industry. The other employers participating in these multiemployer plans are primarily in the entertainment and other related industries. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans as assets contributed to the multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers and if a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be borne by the remaining participating employers. In addition, if we choose to stop participating in some of its multiemployer plans we may be required to pay those plans a withdrawal liability based on the underfunded status of the plan.\nThe financial health of a multiemployer plan is indicated by the zone status, as defined by the Pension Protection Act of 2006. Plans in the red zone are in critical status; those in the yellow zone are in endangered status; and those in the green zone are neither critical nor endangered.\nThe table below presents information concerning our participation in multiemployer defined benefit pension plans.\n(a) The zone status for each individual plan listed was certified by each plan’s actuary as of the beginning of the plan years for 2021 and 2020. The plan year is the twelve months ending December 31 for each plan listed above except AFTRA Retirement Plan which has a plan year ending November 30.\n(b) The Company was listed in AFTRA Retirement Plan’s Form 5500 as providing more than 5% of total contributions for the plan year ended November 30, 2020.\n(c) The expiration dates range from\nMay 15, 2021\nthrough\nMarch 2, 2022\n.\nAs a result of the above noted zone status there were no funding improvements or rehabilitation plans implemented, as defined by ERISA, nor any surcharges imposed for any of the individual plans listed.\nWe also contribute to multiemployer plans that provide postretirement healthcare and other benefits to certain employees under collective bargaining agreements. The contributions to these plans were $\n184\nmillion, $\n95\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. We recognize the\nII-90\nVIACOMCBS INC.

Employer contributions to such plans were $\n106\nmillion, $\n91\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n18)\nREDEEMABLE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST\nWe are subject to a redeemable put option, payable in a foreign currency, with respect to an international subsidiary. The put option expires in December 2022 and is classified as “Redeemable noncontrolling interest” on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe activity reflected within redeemable noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is presented below.\n19)\nSEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe following tables set forth our financial performance by reportable segment. Our operating segments, which are the same as our reportable segments, have been determined in accordance with our internal management structure, which is organized based upon products and services. Beginning in 2022, primarily as a result of our increased strategic focus on our direct-to-consumer businesses, we made certain changes to how we manage our businesses and allocate resources that  resulted in a change to our operating segments (see Note 1).\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we began separately presenting streaming revenues in the categories we use to disaggregate our revenues (see Note 9).\n(a) In 2019, the elimination of intercompany revenues was partially offset by ancillary revenues recorded by our corporate operations\n.\nII-91\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nRevenues generated between segments are principally from the licensing of\nFilmed Entertainment\nand\nCable Networks\ncontent to Paramount+ and licensing of\nFilmed Entertainment\nand\nTV Entertainment\ncontent to\nCable Networks\n. These transactions are recorded at market value as if the sales were to third parties and are eliminated in consolidation. Revenues earned from the licensing of content within segments, including licensing to Paramount+ within the\nTV Entertainment\nsegment, are eliminated within the segment. Intercompany revenues associated with the licensing of programming to Paramount+ after the initial exhibition on our broadcast or cable networks are recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the agreement and eliminated in consolidation.\nWe present operating income excluding depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation, costs for restructuring and other corporate matters, programming charges and net gain on sales, each where applicable (“Adjusted OIBDA”), as the primary measure of profit and loss for our operating segments in accordance with FASB guidance for segment reporting since it is the primary method used by our management. Stock-based compensation is excluded from our segment measure of profit and loss because it is set and approved by our Board of Directors in consultation with corporate executive management.\nII-92\nVIACOMCBS INC.

This tax liability reflects the remaining tax on the Company’s historical accumulated foreign earnings and profits, which is payable to the IRS in 2024 and 2025.\nAt December 31, 2021, commitments for programming and talent and purchase obligations not recorded on the balance sheet, and other long-term contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet were payable as follows:\nWe also have long-term operating and finance lease commitments for office space, equipment, transponders and studio facilities, which are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021. See Note 11 for details of our operating and finance lease commitments.\nGuarantees\nLetters of Credit and Surety Bonds.\nWe have indemnification obligations with respect to letters of credit and surety bonds primarily used as security against non-performance in the normal course of business. At December 31, 2021, the outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds approximated $\n176\nmillion and were not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nCBS Television City\n.  In connection with the sale of CBS Television City in 2019, we guaranteed a specified level of cash flows to be generated by the business during the first\nfive years\nfollowing the completion of the sale. Included in “Other current liabilities” and “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 is a liability of $\n76\nmillion, reflecting the present value of the remaining estimated amount payable under the guarantee obligation.\nLease Guarantees.\nWe have certain indemnification obligations with respect to leases primarily associated with the previously discontinued operations of Famous Players. These lease commitments amounted to $\n50\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, and are presented within “Other liabilities” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The\nII-94\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\namount of lease commitments varies over time depending on the expiration or termination of individual underlying leases, or the related indemnification obligation, and foreign exchange rates, among other things. We may also have exposure for certain other expenses related to the leases, such as property taxes and common area maintenance. We believe our accrual is sufficient to meet any future obligations based on our consideration of available financial information, the lessees’ historical performance in meeting their lease obligations and the underlying economic factors impacting the lessees’ business models.\nIn the course of our business, we both provide and receive indemnities which are intended to allocate certain risks associated with business transactions. Similarly, we may remain contingently liable for various obligations of a business that has been divested in the event that a third party does not live up to its obligations under an indemnification obligation. We record a liability for our indemnification obligations and other contingent liabilities when probable and reasonably estimable.\nLegal Matters\nGeneral\nOn an ongoing basis, we vigorously defend ourselves in numerous lawsuits and proceedings and respond to various investigations and inquiries from federal, state, local and international authorities (collectively, “litigation’’). Litigation may be brought against us without merit, is inherently uncertain and always difficult to predict. However, based on our understanding and evaluation of the relevant facts and circumstances, we believe that the following matters are not likely, in the aggregate, to result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nLitigation Relating to the Merger\nBeginning on February 20, 2020, three purported CBS stockholders filed separate derivative and/or putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On March 31, 2020, the Court consolidated the\nthree\nlawsuits and appointed Bucks County Employees’ Retirement Fund and International Union of Operating Engineers of Eastern Pennsylvania and Delaware as co-lead plaintiffs for the consolidated action. On April 14, 2020, the lead plaintiffs filed a Verified Consolidated Class Action and Derivative Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against Shari E. Redstone, NAI, Sumner M. Redstone National Amusements Trust, members of the CBS Board of Directors (comprised of Candace K. Beinecke, Barbara M. Byrne, Gary L. Countryman, Brian Goldner, Linda M. Griego, Robert N. Klieger, Martha L. Minow, Susan Schuman, Frederick O. Terrell and Strauss Zelnick), former CBS President and Acting Chief Executive Officer Joseph Ianniello and the Company as nominal defendant. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to CBS stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Agreement and Plan of Merger dated as of August 13, 2019, as amended on October 16, 2019 (the “Merger Agreement”). The Complaint also alleges waste and unjust enrichment in connection with Mr. Ianniello’s compensation. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On June 5, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On January 27, 2021, the Court dismissed one disclosure claim, while allowing all other claims against the defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nBeginning on November 25, 2019, four purported Viacom stockholders filed separate putative class action lawsuits in the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware. On January 23, 2020, the Court consolidated the\nfour\nlawsuits. On February 6, 2020, the Court appointed California Public Employees’ Retirement System (“CalPERS”) as lead plaintiff for the consolidated action. On February 28, 2020, CalPERS, together with Park Employees’ and Retirement Board Employees’ Annuity and Benefit Fund of Chicago and Louis M. Wilen, filed a First Amended Verified Class Action Complaint (as used in this paragraph, the “Complaint”) against NAI, NAI\nII-95\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nEntertainment Holdings LLC, Shari E. Redstone, the members of the special transaction committee of the Viacom Board of Directors (comprised of Thomas J. May, Judith A. McHale, Ronald L. Nelson and Nicole Seligman) and our President and Chief Executive Officer and director, Robert M. Bakish. The Complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duties to Viacom stockholders in connection with the negotiation and approval of the Merger Agreement. The Complaint seeks unspecified damages, costs and expenses, as well as other relief. On May 22, 2020, the defendants filed motions to dismiss. On December 29, 2020, the Court dismissed the claims against Mr. Bakish, while allowing the claims against the remaining defendants to proceed. Discovery on the surviving claims is proceeding. We believe that the remaining claims are without merit and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nInvestigation-Related Matters\nAs announced on August 1, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors retained\ntwo\nlaw firms to conduct a full investigation of the allegations in press reports about CBS’ former Chairman of the Board, President and Chief Executive Officer, Leslie Moonves, CBS News and cultural issues at CBS. On December 17, 2018, the CBS Board of Directors announced the completion of its investigation, certain findings of the investigation and the CBS Board of Directors’ determination, with respect to the termination of Mr. Moonves’ employment. We have received subpoenas or requests for information from the New York County District Attorney’s Office, the New York City Commission on Human Rights, the New York State Attorney General’s Office and the United States Securities and Exchange Commission regarding the subject matter of this investigation and related matters, including with respect to CBS’ related public disclosures. We may continue to receive additional related regulatory and investigative inquiries from these and other entities in the future. We are cooperating with these inquiries.\nOn August 27, 2018 and on October 1, 2018, Gene Samit and John Lantz, respectively, filed putative class action lawsuits in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, individually and on behalf of others similarly situated, for claims that are similar to those alleged in the amended complaint described below. On November 6, 2018, the Court entered an order consolidating the two actions. On November 30, 2018, the Court appointed Construction Laborers Pension Trust for Southern California as the lead plaintiff of the consolidated action. On February 11, 2019, the lead plaintiff filed a consolidated amended putative class action complaint against CBS, certain current and former senior executives and members of the CBS Board of Directors. The consolidated action is stated to be on behalf of purchasers of CBS Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock between September 26, 2016 and December 4, 2018. This action seeks to recover damages arising during this time period allegedly caused by the defendants’ purported violations of the federal securities laws, including by allegedly making materially false and misleading statements or failing to disclose material information, and seeks costs and expenses as well as remedies under Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. On April 12, 2019, the defendants filed motions to dismiss this action, which the Court granted in part and denied in part on January 15, 2020. With the exception of one statement made by Mr. Moonves at an industry event in November 2017, in which he allegedly was acting as the agent of CBS, all claims as to all other allegedly false and misleading statements were dismissed. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to court approval. All amounts payable by the Company under the settlement will be paid by the Company’s insurers.\nLitigation Related to Television Station Owners\nOn September 9, 2019, the Company was added as a defendant in a multi-district putative class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The lawsuit was filed by parties that claim to have purchased broadcast television spot advertising beginning on or about January 1, 2014 on television stations owned by one or more of the defendant television station owners and alleges the sharing of allegedly\nII-96\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\ncompetitively sensitive information among such television stations in alleged violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The action, which names the Company among\nfourteen\ntotal defendants, seeks monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and interest as well as injunctions against the allegedly unlawful conduct. On October 8, 2019, the Company and other defendants filed a motion to dismiss the matter, which was denied by the court on November 6, 2020. We have reached an agreement in principle with the plaintiffs to settle the lawsuit. The settlement, which will include no admission of liability or wrongdoing by the Company, will be subject to court approval.\nLitigation Related to Stock Offerings\nOn August 13, 2021, Camelot Event Driven Fund filed a putative securities class action lawsuit in New York Supreme Court, County of New York, and on November 5, 2021, an amended complaint was filed that, among other changes, added an additional named plaintiff (the “Complaint”). The Complaint is purportedly on behalf of investors who purchased shares of the Company’s Class B Common Stock and\n5.75\n% Series A Mandatory Convertible Preferred Stock pursuant to public securities offerings completed in March 2021, and was filed against the Company, certain senior executives, members of our Board of Directors, and the underwriters involved in the offerings. The Complaint asserts violations of federal securities law and alleges that the offering documents contained material misstatements and omissions, including through an alleged failure to adequately disclose certain total return swap transactions involving Archegos Capital Management referenced to our securities and related alleged risks to the Company’s stock price. On December 22, 2021, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation seeking the voluntary dismissal without prejudice of the outside director defendants from the lawsuit, which the Court subsequently ordered. On the same date, the defendants filed motions to dismiss the lawsuit, which are pending. The Complaint seeks unspecified compensatory damages, as well as other relief. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously.\nLitigation Related to the Proposed Sale of Simon & Schuster\nOn November 2, 2021, the U.S. Department of Justice (the “DOJ”) filed suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia to block our sale of the Simon & Schuster business to Penguin Random House (the “Transaction”) pursuant to a Share Purchase Agreement (“Purchase Agreement”), dated November 24, 2020, between the Company, certain of its subsidiaries, Penguin Random House and Bertelsmann SE & Co. KGaA. The DOJ asserts that the sale of Simon & Schuster would reduce competition for the acquisition of titles. The Purchase Agreement contains customary representations and warranties and covenants, including commitments on the part of Penguin Random House to take all necessary steps to obtain any required regulatory approvals and to defend any litigation that would delay or prevent consummation, and also provides for a termination fee payable to the Company in certain circumstances in the event the Transaction does not close for regulatory reasons. We and the other defendants believe the DOJ’s claims are without merit, and we intend to defend against them vigorously.\nClaims Related to Former Businesses: Asbestos\nWe are a defendant in lawsuits claiming various personal injuries related to asbestos and other materials, which allegedly occurred as a result of exposure caused by various products manufactured by Westinghouse, a predecessor, generally prior to the early 1970s. Westinghouse was neither a producer nor a manufacturer of asbestos. We are typically named as one of a large number of defendants in both state and federal cases. In the majority of asbestos lawsuits, the plaintiffs have not identified which of our products is the basis of a claim. Claims against us in which a product has been identified most commonly relate to allegations of exposure to asbestos-containing insulating material used in conjunction with turbines and electrical equipment.\nClaims are frequently filed and/or settled in groups, which may make the amount and timing of settlements, and the number of pending claims, subject to significant fluctuation from period to period. We do not report as\nII-97\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\npending those claims on inactive, stayed, deferred or similar dockets that some jurisdictions have established for claimants who allege minimal or no impairment. As of December 31, 2021, we had pending approximately\n27,770\nasbestos claims, as compared with approximately\n30,710\nas of December 31, 2020 and\n30,950\nas of December 31, 2019. During 2021, we received approximately\n3,050\nnew claims and closed or moved to an inactive docket approximately\n5,990\nclaims. We report claims as closed when we become aware that a dismissal order has been entered by a court or when we have reached agreement with the claimants on the material terms of a settlement. Settlement costs depend on the seriousness of the injuries that form the basis of the claims, the quality of evidence supporting the claims and other factors. Our total costs for the years 2021 and 2020 for settlement and defense of asbestos claims after insurance recoveries and net of tax were approximately $\n63\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion, respectively. Our costs for settlement and defense of asbestos claims may vary year to year and insurance proceeds are not always recovered in the same period as the insured portion of the expenses.\nFilings include claims for individuals suffering from mesothelioma, a rare cancer, the risk of which is allegedly increased by exposure to asbestos; lung cancer, a cancer which may be caused by various factors, one of which is alleged to be asbestos exposure; other cancers, and conditions that are substantially less serious, including claims brought on behalf of individuals who are asymptomatic as to an allegedly asbestos-related disease. The predominant number of pending claims against us are non-cancer claims. It is difficult to predict future asbestos liabilities, as events and circumstances may impact the estimate of our asbestos liabilities, including, among others, the number and types of claims and average cost to resolve such claims. We record an accrual for a loss contingency when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. We believe that our accrual and insurance are sufficient to cover our asbestos liabilities. Our liability estimate is based upon many factors, including the number of outstanding claims, estimated average cost per claim, the breakdown of claims by disease type, historic claim filings, costs per claim of resolution and the filing of new claims, as well as consultation with a third party firm on trends that may impact our future asbestos liability.\nOther\nFrom time to time we receive claims from federal and state environmental regulatory agencies and other entities asserting that we are or may be liable for environmental cleanup costs and related damages principally relating to our historical and predecessor operations. In addition, from time to time we receive personal injury claims including toxic tort and product liability claims (other than asbestos) arising from our historical operations and predecessors.\n21)\nSUPPLEMENTAL FINANCIAL INFORMATION\nThe following table presents the components of Other items, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(a) Reflects the accelerated recognition of a portion of the unamortized actuarial losses due to the volume of lump sum benefit payments in one of our pension plans.\nII-98\nVIACOMCBS INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (Continued)\n(Tabular dollars in millions, except per share amounts)\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nVariable Interest Entities\nIn the normal course of business, we enter into joint ventures or make investments with business partners that support our underlying business strategy and provide us the ability to enter new markets to expand the reach of our brands, develop new programming and/or distribute our existing content. In certain instances, an entity in which we make an investment may qualify as a VIE. In determining whether we are the primary beneficiary of a VIE, we assess whether we have the power to direct matters that most significantly impact the activities of the VIE and have the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE.\nThe following tables present the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements related to our consolidated VIEs.\n(a) Revenues and operating income from our consolidated VIEs were not significant for 2019.\n(b) The revenue and operating income include the licensing of the streaming rights to\nSouth Park\nby a consolidated\n51\n%-owned VIE in 2020.\nII-99"
