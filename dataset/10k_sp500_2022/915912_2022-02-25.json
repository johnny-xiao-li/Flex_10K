    "text": "General\nAvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the “Company,” which term, unless the context otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its subsidiaries), is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes. We develop, redevelop, acquire, own and operate multifamily apartment communities in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California, as well as in our expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado. We focus on leading metropolitan areas that we believe historically have been characterized by growing employment in high wage sectors of the economy, higher cost of home ownership and a diverse and vibrant quality of life. We believe these market characteristics have offered, and will continue in the future to offer, the opportunity for superior risk-adjusted returns over the long-term on apartment community investments relative to other markets that do not have these characteristics.\nAt January 31, 2022, we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in:\n•\n278 operating apartment communities containing 81,803 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 268 communities containing 79,213 apartment homes were consolidated for financial reporting purposes and 10 communities containing 2,590 apartment homes were held by unconsolidated entities in which we hold an ownership interest.\n•\n17 wholly-owned apartment communities under development that are expected to contain an aggregate of 5,386 apartment homes when completed and two unconsolidated investments which each hold an apartment community under development and together are expected to contain an aggregate of 803 apartment homes when completed.\n•\nThe Park Loggia, which contains 172 for-sale residential condominiums, of which 132 have been sold as of January 31, 2022, and 66,000 square feet of commercial space, of which 87% has been leased as of January 31, 2022.\n•\nRights to develop an additional 27 communities that, if developed as expected, will contain 10,092 apartment homes.\nWe generally obtain ownership in an apartment community by developing a new community on either vacant land or land with improvements that we raze, or by acquiring an existing community. In selecting sites for development or acquisition, we favor locations that are near expanding employment centers and convenient to transportation, recreation areas, entertainment, shopping and dining.\n1\nOur principal financial goal is to increase long-term shareholder value through the development, redevelopment, acquisition, ownership and, when appropriate, disposition of apartment communities in our markets. To help meet this goal, we regularly (i) monitor our investment allocation by geographic market and product type, (ii) develop, redevelop and acquire interests in apartment communities in our selected markets, (iii) selectively sell apartment communities that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when opportunities are presented to realize a portion of the value created through our investment and redeploy the proceeds from those sales and (iv) maintain a capital structure that we believe is aligned with our business risks and allows us to maintain continuous access to cost-effective capital. We undertake our development and redevelopment activities primarily through in-house development and redevelopment teams, which are complemented by our in-house acquisition platform. We believe that our organizational structure, which includes dedicated development and operational teams, and strong culture are key differentiators. We pursue our development, redevelopment, investment and operating activities with the purpose of\nCreating a Better Way to Live\n.\nOur strategic vision is to be the leading apartment company in select US markets, providing a range of distinctive living experiences that customers value. We pursue this vision by targeting what we believe are among the best markets and submarkets, leveraging our strategic capabilities in market research and consumer insight and being disciplined in our capital allocation and balance sheet management. We operate our apartment communities under four core brands, Avalon, AVA, eaves by Avalon and our Kanso brand which we introduced in 2020. We believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint. Our core “Avalon” brand focuses on upscale apartment living and high end amenities and services. “AVA” targets customers in high energy, transit-served neighborhoods and generally feature smaller apartments, many of which are designed for roommate living, and a variety of active common spaces that encourage socialization. “eaves by Avalon” is targeted to the cost conscious, “value” segment primarily in suburban areas. In 2020, we introduced our \"Kanso\" brand through one of our current Development Communities. The Kanso brand is designed to create an apartment living experience that offers simplicity without sacrifice at a more moderate price point, featuring high-quality apartment homes, limited-to-no community amenities and a low-touch, largely self-service operating model that leverages technology and smart access. We believe that these brands allow us to further penetrate our existing markets by appealing to different consumer preferences.\nDuring the three years ended December 31, 2021, we:\n•\nacquired 12 apartment communities, excluding unconsolidated investments, and in 2019 we purchased our joint venture partner's interest in one operating community, obtaining a 100% ownership in that apartment community;\n•\ndisposed of 24 apartment communities, excluding unconsolidated investments;\n•\nrealized our pro rata share of the gain from the sale of four communities owned by unconsolidated real estate entities; and\n•\ncompleted the development of 24 apartment communities and the redevelopment of nine apartment communities.\nA more detailed description of our unconsolidated real estate entities and the related investment activity can be found in Note 5, “Investments,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 of this report and in Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nA further discussion of our development, redevelopment, disposition, acquisition, property management and related strategies follows.\nDevelopment Strategy.\nWe select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. As one of the largest developers of multifamily rental apartment communities in our selected markets, we maintain regional offices to identify and support development opportunities through local market presence and access to local market information. In addition to our principal executive office in Arlington, Virginia, we also have regional offices, administrative offices or specialty offices, including offices that are in or near the following cities:\n2\n•\nBellevue, Washington;\n•\nBoca Raton and Miami, Florida;\n•\nBoston, Massachusetts;\n•\nChapel Hill, North Carolina;\n•\nDenver, Colorado;\n•\nIrvine, California;\n•\nLos Angeles, California;\n•\nMelville, New York;\n•\nNew York, New York;\n•\nSan Francisco, California;\n•\nSan Jose, California;\n•\nShelton Connecticut;\n•\nVirginia Beach, Virginia; and\n•\nWestfield, New Jersey.\nAfter selecting a site for development, we usually negotiate for the right to acquire the site either through an option or a long-term conditional contract. Options and long-term conditional contracts generally allow us to acquire an interest in the site after the completion of entitlements and shortly before the start of construction, which reduces development-related risks and preserves capital. However, as a result of competitive market conditions for land suitable for development, we have sometimes acquired and held land prior to construction for extended periods while entitlements are obtained, or acquired land zoned for uses other than residential with the potential for rezoning. When acquiring improved land with existing commercial uses prior to development, any rent received in excess of expenses from these operations, which we consider to be incidental, is accounted for as a reduction in our investment in the development pursuit and not as net income. Any expenses relating to these operations, in excess of any rents received, are recognized in net income. We have also participated, and may in the future participate, in master planned or other large multi-use developments where we commit to build infrastructure (such as roads) to be used by other participants or commit to act as construction manager or general contractor in building structures or spaces for third parties (such as unimproved ground floor commercial space, municipal garages or parks). Costs we incur in connection with these activities may be accounted for as additional invested capital in the community or we may earn fee income for providing these services. Particularly with large scale, urban in-fill developments, we may engage in significant environmental remediation efforts to prepare a site for construction. For further discussion of our Development Rights, refer to Item 2. “Properties” in this report.\nWe generally act as our own general contractor and construction manager, except for certain mid-rise and high-rise apartment communities, or in locations where we have limited historical experience such as our expansion markets where we may elect to use third-party general contractors as construction managers. We generally perform these functions directly (although we may use a wholly-owned subsidiary) both for ourselves and for the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner. We believe direct involvement in construction enables us to achieve higher construction quality, greater control over construction schedules and cost savings. Our development, property management and construction teams monitor construction progress to ensure quality workmanship and a smooth and timely transition into the leasing and operating phase.\nThroughout this report, the term “development” is used to refer to the entire property development cycle, including pursuit of zoning approvals, procurement of architectural and engineering designs and the construction process. References to “construction” refer to the actual construction of the property, which is only one element of the development cycle.\nRedevelopment Strategy.\nWhen we undertake the redevelopment of a community, our goal is to renovate and/or rebuild an existing community so that our total investment is generally below replacement cost and the community is well positioned in the market to achieve attractive returns on our capital. We have dedicated redevelopment teams and procedures that are intended to control both the cost and risks of redevelopment. Our redevelopment teams, which include redevelopment, construction and property management personnel, monitor redevelopment progress.\nThroughout this report, the term “redevelopment” is used to refer to the entire redevelopment cycle, including planning and procurement of architectural and engineering designs, budgeting and actual renovation work. The actual renovation work is referred to as “reconstruction,” which is only one element of the redevelopment cycle.\n3\nDisposition Strategy.\nWe sell assets that no longer meet our long-term strategy or when real estate market conditions are favorable, and we redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities and to rebalance our portfolio across or within geographic regions. This also allows us to realize a portion of the value created through our investments and provides additional liquidity by redeploying the net proceeds from our dispositions in lieu of raising that amount of capital externally. When we decide to sell a community, we generally solicit competing bids from unrelated parties for these individual assets and consider the sales price and other terms of each proposal.\nAs part of the Archstone Acquisition in 2013 (as defined in Item 1. “Business” in the Company's Form 10-K filed February 22, 2019), we acquired, and still own, 14 assets that had previously been contributed by third parties on a tax-deferred basis to an Archstone partnership in which the third parties received ownership interests. To protect the tax-deferred nature of the contribution, the third parties are entitled to cash payments if we trigger tax obligations to the third parties by selling, or failing to maintain sufficient levels of secured financing on, the contributed assets. Our tax protection payment obligations with respect to these assets expire at different times and in some cases don’t expire until the death of a third party who contributed ownership interests to the Archstone partnership. After review and investigation of Archstone’s tax and accounting records, we estimate that, had we sold or taken other triggering actions in 2021 with respect to all 14 assets, the aggregate amount of the tax protection payments that would have been triggered would have been approximately $45,100,000. At the present time, we do not intend to take actions that would cause us to be required to make tax protection payments with respect to any of these assets.\nAcquisition Strategy.\nOur core competencies in development and redevelopment discussed above allow us to be selective in the acquisitions we target. Acquisitions allow us to achieve rapid penetration into markets in which we desire an increased presence. Acquisitions (and dispositions) also help us achieve our desired product mix or rebalance our portfolio. While we are primarily focused on acquisitions in our expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado, we may pursue additional investments in our legacy coastal markets based on market conditions.\nProperty Management Strategy.\nWe seek to increase operating income through innovative, proactive property management that will result in higher revenue from communities while constraining operating expenses. Our principal strategies to maximize operating income include:\n•\nfocusing on associate engagement and resident satisfaction;\n•\nstaggering lease terms such that lease expirations are matched with seasonal demand;\n•\ndelivering high occupancy with premium pricing for various customer segments; and\n•\nmaking innovations in our operating model through (i) leveraging technology, including digital, cloud and various automation technologies and (ii) data science to optimize revenue from the portfolio, while reducing customer acquisition, transaction and retention costs.\nConstraining growth in operating expenses is another way in which we seek to increase earnings growth. Growth in our portfolio and the resulting increase in revenue allows for fixed operating costs to be spread over a larger volume of revenue, thereby increasing operating margins. We constrain growth in operating expenses in a variety of ways, which include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\npurchase order controls, acquiring goods and services from pre-approved vendors;\n•\nnational negotiated contracts and bulk purchases where possible;\n•\nbidding third-party contracts on a volume basis;\n•\nretaining residents through high levels of service, which reduces apartment turnover costs, marketing and vacant apartment utility costs;\n•\nperforming turnover work in-house or hiring third parties, generally considering the most cost effective approach as well as expertise needed to perform the work;\n•\nregular preventive maintenance to maximize resident safety and satisfaction and property and equipment life;\n•\ncentralization of many community administration and support tasks at our shared service center;\n•\npursuing real estate tax appeals;\n•\ninstalling high efficiency lighting and water fixtures, cogeneration systems and solar panels; and\n•\nimplementing technology for resident and prospect services such as package lockers and self guided or virtual tours.\n4\nOn-site property management teams receive bonuses based largely upon the revenue, expense, Net Operating Income (“NOI”) and customer service metrics produced at their respective communities. We use and continuously seek ways to improve technology applications to help manage our communities, believing that the accurate collection of financial and resident data will enable us to maximize revenue and control costs through careful leasing decisions, maintenance decisions and financial management.\nWe generally manage the operation and leasing activity of our communities directly (although we may use a wholly-owned subsidiary) both for ourselves and the joint ventures and partnerships of which we are a member or a partner. From time to time we may engage a third party to manage leasing and/or maintenance activity at one or more of our communities where we have limited historical experience such as our expansion markets or for other reasons.\nFrom time to time we also pursue or arrange ancillary services for our residents to provide additional revenue sources or increase resident satisfaction. We provide such non-customary services to residents or share in the revenue or income from such services through a “taxable REIT subsidiary,” which is a subsidiary that is treated as a “C corporation” subject to federal income taxes. See “Tax Matters” below.\nFinancing Strategy.\nOur financing strategy is to maintain a capital structure that provides financial flexibility to help ensure we can select cost effective capital market options that are well matched to our business risks. We estimate that our short-term liquidity needs will be met from cash on hand, borrowings under our $1,750,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility (the “Credit Facility”), sales of current operating communities and/or issuance of additional debt or equity securities. A determination to engage in an equity or debt offering depends on a variety of factors such as general market and economic conditions, our short and long-term liquidity needs, the relative costs of debt and equity capital and growth opportunities. A summary of debt and equity activity for the last three years is reflected on our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows of the Consolidated Financial Statements set forth in Item 8 of this report.\nWe have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, joint ventures (including limited liability companies or partnerships) through which we would develop and/or own an indirect economic interest of less than 100% of the community or communities owned directly by such joint ventures. Our decision to either hold an apartment community in fee simple or to have an indirect interest in the community through a joint venture is based on a variety of factors and considerations, including: (i) the economic and tax terms required by a seller of land or of a community; (ii) our desire to diversify our portfolio of communities by market, submarket and product type; (iii) our desire at times to preserve our capital resources to maintain liquidity or balance sheet strength; and (iv) our projection, in some circumstances, that we will achieve higher returns on our invested capital or reduce our risk if a joint venture vehicle is used. Investments in joint ventures are not limited to a specified percentage of our assets. Each joint venture agreement is individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture agreement.\nIn addition, from time to time, we may offer shares of our equity securities, debt securities or options to purchase stock in exchange for property. We may also acquire properties in exchange for properties we currently own.\n5\nOther Strategies and Activities.\nWhile we emphasize equity real estate investments in rental apartment communities, we have the ability to invest in other activities and to make non-equity investments, including the following:\n•\nCommercial space\n: we own and lease commercial space at our communities when either (i) the highest and best use of the space is for commercial (e.g., street level in an urban area); (ii) we believe the commercial space will enhance the attractiveness of the community to residents or; (iii) some component of commercial space is required to obtain entitlements to build apartment homes. As of December 31, 2021, we had a total of approximately 867,000 square feet of rentable commercial space, excluding commercial space within communities currently under development. Gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in 2021 was $31,885,000 (1.4% of total revenue).\n•\nFor-sale real estate development\n: we may also develop a property in conjunction with another real estate company that will own and operate the commercial or for-sale residential components of a mixed-use building or project that we help develop. We may from time to time, through a taxable REIT subsidiary (\"TRS\"), develop real estate and hold it out for sale upon completion if we believe, at the outset or due to changed circumstances, that this will be the best use or disposition opportunity for the property, as is the case with our sale of apartment condominium units at The Park Loggia condominium development in New York, NY.\n•\nProperty technology and environmental investments\n: we have also invested, either through a wholly-owned TRS, or in an investment vehicle that has elected to be treated as a TRS, in companies (and in venture funds that invest in companies) that provide technology services to the real estate industry, and we have invested, through a TRS, in environmentally focused investment funds to further our sustainability efforts and learning. As of December 31, 2021, we invested $17,277,000 in various property technology and environmentally focused companies directly and indirectly through investment management funds.\n•\nDebt financing\n: while we generally invest in equity through fee simple ownership or an equity investment in a joint venture, we may invest in mortgages (including participating or convertible mortgages) secured by real estate owned or being developed by an unaffiliated third party, and we may act as a direct, unsecured lender to an unaffiliated third party that owns or is developing real estate. At December 31, 2021, we had no such investments but were pursuing opportunities to make such investments.\nWe have not engaged in trading, underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers and do not intend to do so. At all times we intend to make investments in a manner so as to qualify as a REIT unless, because of circumstances or changes to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”) (or the Treasury Regulations thereunder), our Board of Directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a REIT.\nWe conduct many of the administrative functions associated with our property operations (including billing, collections, and response to resident inquiries) through an internally operated shared services center, rather than having on-site associates conduct such activities. We believe this centralized platform allows our on-site associates to focus more on current and prospective resident services, while at the same time enabling us to reduce costs, mitigate risk and increase our availability and responsiveness to our residents. We are exploring the possibility of performing these shared service center administrative functions for a third party as a means of creating an additional revenue stream and economies of scale at our center. We cannot assure that we will provide such services to a third party or that it will be successful if we do so.\nTax Matters\nWe filed an election with our 1994 federal income tax return to be taxed as a REIT under the Code and intend to maintain our qualification as a REIT in the future. As a REIT, with limited exceptions, such as those described under “Property Management Strategy” above, we will not be taxed under federal and certain state income tax laws at the corporate level on our taxable net income to the extent such taxable net income is distributed to our stockholders. We expect to make sufficient distributions to avoid income tax at the corporate level. While we believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT, there can be no assurance that we will be successful in this regard. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control.\n6\nCompetition\nWe face competition from other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, REITs both in the multifamily as well as other sectors, and other well capitalized investors, to acquire and develop apartment communities and acquire land for future development. As an owner and operator of apartment communities, we also face competition for prospective residents from other operators whose communities may be perceived to offer a better location or better amenities or whose pricing may be perceived as a better value given the quality, location, terms and amenities that the prospective resident seeks. We also compete against condominiums and single-family homes that are for sale or rent, including those offered through online platforms. Although we often compete against large, sophisticated developers and operators for development opportunities and for prospective residents, real estate developers and operators of any size can provide effective competition for both real estate assets and potential residents.\nRegulatory Matters\nCompliance with various governmental regulations has an impact on our business, including our capital expenditures, earnings and competitive position, which can be material. We incur costs to monitor and take actions to comply with governmental regulations that are applicable to our business, which include, among others, federal securities laws and regulations, applicable stock exchange requirements, REIT and other tax laws and regulations, environmental and health and safety laws and regulations, local zoning, usage and other regulations relating to real property, the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 and related laws and regulations.\nEnvironmental Regulations.\nAs a current or prior owner, operator and developer of real estate, we are subject to various federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances and also could be liable to third parties resulting from environmental contamination or noncompliance at our communities. For some Development Communities, we undertake extensive environmental remediation to prepare the site for construction, which could be a significant portion of our total construction cost. Environmental remediation efforts could expose us to possible liabilities for accidents or improper handling of contaminated materials during construction.\nWe believe that more government regulation of energy use, along with a greater focus on environmental protection, may, over time, have a significant impact on urban growth patterns. If changes in zoning to encourage greater density and proximity to mass transit do occur, such changes could benefit multifamily housing and those companies with a competency in high-density development. However, there can be no assurance as to whether or when such changes in regulations or zoning will occur or, if they do occur, whether the multifamily industry or the Company will benefit from such changes.\nRegulations Relating to the Construction, Operation and Leasing of Our Communities.\nThe construction, operation and leasing of our communities is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations, include zoning laws, building codes, requirements that our communities be accessible to persons with disabilities, fair housing laws, and, depending on the jurisdiction, regulations regarding the charging of rents and fees and increases in such amounts upon renewal of leases. Some laws relating to the setting of rents apply broadly, such as in California, where residential rent increases at renewal in communities older than fifteen years are limited to the lesser of 10% or 5% plus local consumer price index (CPI), and in New York, where laws regulate increases on those units that are subject to rent-control or rent-stabilization. In California, the Governor and local governments have the ability to enact (and have in recent years exercised such right, for example, in connection with wildfires) local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents to no more than 10% over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared, which has impacted some of our California communities. In addition, various temporary federal, state and local laws enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic have imposed additional regulations of or limitations on our ability to evict tenants who are delinquent in payment of their rent, charge late fees, or raise rents more than a regulated amount upon renewal.\nSee Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of material risks to us, including, to the extent material, to our competitive position, relating to governmental regulations, and see Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” together with the Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, for a discussion of material information relevant to an assessment of our financial condition and results of operations.\nHuman Capital\nAttracting, motivating, developing, and retaining talented associates who share our purpose, core values and cultural norms is important to our long-term success. We train our associates to understand our purpose (\nCreating a Better Way to Live\n), our core\n7\nvalues (a commitment to integrity, a spirit of caring and a focus on continuous improvement) and our cultural norms (we collaborate, excel, innovate, act like owners, are thoughtful and thorough, and show appreciation).\nAt January 31, 2022, we had 2,927 employees, of which approximately 97% were employed on a full-time basis. Approximately 70% of our associates work on-site at our operating communities and the balance work on other matters. None of our associates are represented by a union except for approximately 20 maintenance associates at communities in Westchester County, New York, where we are in the process of negotiating a collective bargaining agreement.\nWe consider the following aspects of human capital management to be important:\nDiversity and Inclusion.\nWe value workforce diversity and an inclusive culture. We believe that a diverse workplace will produce a variety of perspectives, motivate associates and help us understand and better serve our customers and the communities in which we do business. At January 31, 2022, 38% of our associates self-identified as White, 30% as Hispanic, 14% as Black, 6% as Asian, and 12% as other ethnicities,\ntwo or more ethnicities or did not respond. At January 31, 2022, 61% of our associates self-identified as male and 39% as female. We are committed to promoting and achieving greater workplace diversity and have undertaken active steps to further this goal.\nAssociate Engagement.\nWe monitor the engagement of our associates, receive feedback from our associates, and benchmark our performance by having a third party firm conduct anonymous associate perspective surveys each year. The results are discussed and presented both on a company-wide basis and within each functional group.\nSafety.\nWe take workplace safety seriously at our construction sites, our operating communities and our offices. Through our Construction Site Safety Observation program and our dedicated safety team, we monitor project-level safety performance metrics at our construction sites, and elements of compensation for our construction group and our CEO are based on safety compliance performance. Our maintenance associates are required to take monthly safety training on a variety of subjects, and our risk management group monitors incident reports from our offices and communities. The COVID-19 pandemic has presented unique health and safety challenges, and we have taken a number of actions in response to promote the well-being of our associates, including permitting remote work and flexible schedules where feasible, providing extended Company paid leave for associates who needed to miss work for COVID-19 related reasons, establishing office and community protocols for associate safety, conducting training and refresher courses on COVID-19 prevention and communicating regularly with associates on COVID-19 topics.\nTraining.\nWe help our associates develop the skills they need to advance in their careers and succeed at AvalonBay. We train our associates in a variety of ways, including through our learning management system, AvalonBay University, which offers approximately 900 courses providing technical, management, ethics, compliance and cyber-awareness training.\nOther Information\nWe file annual, quarterly and current reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. You may obtain copies of our SEC filings, free of charge, from the SEC's website at www.sec.gov.\nWe maintain a website at www.avalonbay.com. Our annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and amendments to those reports, filed or furnished pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge in the “Investor Relations” section of our website as soon as reasonably practicable after the reports are filed with or furnished to the SEC.

    "text": "Our operations involve various risks that could have adverse consequences, including those described below. This Item 1A. includes forward-looking statements. You should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward-looking statements in this Form 10-K.\nRisks related to the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact on multifamily rental housing\nThe national and global impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic (including the impact of new strains of the original virus) continue to evolve. Regulatory measures have at times included varying requirements for social distancing, limitations on landlords' rights with respect to delinquent tenants, and restrictions on travel, congregation and business operations. Business and consumer preferences for work and living arrangements during the pandemic continue to evolve as well. The long-term impact of COVID-19 on the economy remains uncertain. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to present material uncertainty and risk with respect to our performance, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Moreover, many of the risk factors set forth in this Form 10-K should be interpreted as heightened risks as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition, if in the future there is an outbreak of another highly infectious or contagious disease, the Company and our properties may be subject to similar risks as the risks posed by COVID-19.\nRegulatory, business and consumer responses to the COVID-19 pandemic impact our operations.\nOperating impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic include the following:\n•\nNumerous state, local, and federal entities imposed restrictions, for varying times and to varying degrees, on our ability to enforce residents’ contractual lease obligations, and this will continue to affect our ability (until a restriction is lifted or expires) to enforce all our remedies (such as pursuing collections and seeking evictions) for the failure to pay rent.\n•\nConsumers whose income has declined, who are\nworking remotely or who cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues, may decide to live in a location other than our markets. For as long as interest rates remain low and health concerns remain, consumers who would otherwise rent a multifamily apartment may opt instead to rent a single family home or purchase a home. Demand from students and demand for corporate apartment homes have been and may continue to be negatively impacted by trends in remote learning and work, and the adoption of new online technologies.\n•\nVarious state, local and federal rules required us, in some jurisdictions or for some properties, to waive late fees and certain other customary fees associated with our apartment rental business, and may do so in the future. We have elected at times also to waive these fees even where or when not required, and may do so in the future. These requirements or practices have resulted, and to the extent implemented or continued may in the future result, in foregone revenue.\n•\nOur properties may also incur significant costs or losses related to shelter-in-place or stay-at-home orders, quarantines, infection, clean-up costs or other related factors.\n•\nSocial distancing and other measures have caused us from time to time to revise the manner in which we meet with prospective residents and serve current residents. For example, prospective residents visiting apartments may do so virtually or on a self-tour rather than being accompanied by a leasing consultant. In addition, in many communities, access to various common areas may be limited. These factors may affect resident satisfaction and leasing velocity.\n•\nThere are growing concerns related to the general economy about (i) supply chain constraints caused by business challenges resulting from the pandemic and (ii) inflation caused by both supply chain constraints and governmental fiscal and monetary policies. Supply chain constraints could cause delays in our construction and redevelopment activity, and inflation could cause our construction and operating costs to increase. In the event that our rents and rental revenue do not increase sufficiently to offset increases in construction and operating costs, our operating results would be negatively impacted.\nIn addition to renting apartment homes directly to residents, we also lease ancillary commercial space at our communities and lease apartment homes to corporate apartment home providers. In 2021, 1.4% of our total revenue was from commercial tenants and 2.1% of our total residential revenue was from corporate apartment home providers. To the extent that the pandemic or any associated government restrictions have adverse impacts on the businesses of our commercial tenants, or demand from corporate apartment home providers, we may experience elevated delinquencies for these tenants. There may also be a greater risk of bankruptcy and default from commercial and corporate apartment home providers.\n9\nEmergency orders shutting down non-essential businesses, limiting congregations of people, and requiring social distancing have at times disrupted, and may in the future disrupt, our development and construction activity. To the extent we experience delays in construction, our construction costs may increase and we may not achieve, on the schedule we originally planned, the cash flows that we expect when we begin leasing a completed property. We may also delay the start of construction of additional development communities which, if constructed and leased as originally planned, would have been a source of future additional cash flow.\nThe same factors as described immediately above may also impact our workforce. Many associates, particularly in overhead positions, are working remotely. This disruption in the normal operations of our workforce, as well as the possibility of illness among our associates or a substantial portion of our workforce, could also adversely affect our operations.\nRisks related to investments through acquisitions, construction, development, and joint ventures\nDevelopment, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability.\nWe intend to continue to develop and redevelop apartment home communities. These activities can include long planning and entitlement timelines and can involve complex and costly activities, including significant environmental remediation or construction work in high-density urban areas. These activities may expose us to the following risks, among others:\n•\nwe may abandon opportunities that we have already begun to explore for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions or increases in construction or financing costs, and, as a result, we may fail to recover expenses already incurred in exploring those opportunities;\n•\noccupancy rates and rents at a community may fail to meet our original expectations for a number of reasons, including changes in market and economic conditions beyond our control and the development by competitors of competing communities;\n•\nwe may be unable to obtain, or experience delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, occupancy or other required governmental or third party permits and authorizations, which could result in increased costs, or the delay or abandonment of opportunities;\n•\nwe may incur costs that exceed our original estimates due to increased material, labor or other costs;\n•\nwe may be unable to complete construction of a community on schedule or for the originally projected cost resulting in increased construction and financing costs;\n•\nwe may incur liabilities to third parties during the development process, for example, in connection with managing existing improvements on the site prior to tenant terminations and demolition (such as commercial space) or in connection with providing services to third parties (such as the construction of shared infrastructure or other improvements); and\n•\nwe may incur liability if our communities are not constructed in compliance with the accessibility provisions of the Americans with Disabilities Acts, the Fair Housing Act or other federal, state or local requirements. Noncompliance could result in imposition of fines, an award of damages to private litigants and a requirement that we undertake structural modifications to remedy the noncompliance.\nRefer to our “Risks related to liquidity and financing” section below for additional construction and development risks related to financing.\nAttractive investment opportunities may not be available, which could adversely affect our profitability.\nWe expect that other real estate investors, including insurance companies, pension and investment funds, other REITs and other well-capitalized investors, will compete with us to acquire existing properties and to develop new properties. This competition could increase prices for properties of the type we would likely pursue and adversely affect our profitability for new investments.\nAcquisitions may not yield anticipated results.\nOur business strategy includes acquiring as well as developing communities. Our acquisition activities may be exposed to the following risks:\n•\nan acquired property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment; and\n•\nour estimate of the costs of operating, repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove inaccurate.\nFailure to succeed in new markets, or with new brands and community formats, or in activities other than the development, ownership and operation of residential rental communities may have adverse consequences.\n10\nWe may from time to time commence development activity or make acquisitions outside of our existing market areas if appropriate opportunities arise. Our historical experience in our existing markets in developing, owning and operating rental communities does not ensure that we will be able to operate successfully in new markets. We may be exposed to a variety of risks when we enter a new market, including an inability to accurately evaluate local apartment market conditions and an inability to obtain land for development or to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities.\nWe also may engage or have an interest in for-sale activity, such as the sale of the residential condominiums at The Park Loggia, a mixed-use development located in New York, New York. We may be unsuccessful at developing real estate with the intent to sell or in selling condominiums at originally underwritten values, or at all, as a disposition strategy for an asset, which could have an adverse effect on our results of operations.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with investment in, and management of, discretionary real estate investment funds and joint ventures and technology and environmentally focused companies.\nAt times we invest directly and indirectly in real estate as a partner or a co-venturer with other investors or in technology and environmentally focused companies. Joint venture investments (including investments through partnerships or limited liability companies) involve risks, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent or otherwise refuse to make capital contributions when due; that we may be responsible to our partner for indemnifiable losses or the debt and obligations of an investment; that our investments may lose all or some of their value; that our partner might have business goals that are inconsistent with ours which may result in the venture or investment being unable to implement certain decisions that we consider beneficial; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; that, in cases where we are the general partner or managing member, our partners holding a majority of the equity interests may remove us from such role in certain cases involving cause; and that we may be liable and/or our status as a REIT may be jeopardized if either the investments, or the REIT entities associated with the investments, fail to comply with various tax or other regulatory matters. Frequently, we and our partner may each have the right to trigger a buy-sell or similar arrangement that could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner's interest or force a sale of the asset, at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction and on terms that are not most advantageous to us.\nOur investments in technology companies, or in funds that invest in technology companies, are generally held through taxable REIT subsidiaries pursuant to which we will incur taxable gains upon the disposition of our interests. In addition, the value of these investments may be volatile and declines in value may impact our reported income even if we do not sell the investment.\nWe are exposed to risks associated with real estate assets that are subject to ground leases that may restrict our ability to finance, sell or otherwise transfer our interests in those assets, limit our use and expose us to loss if such agreements are breached by us or terminated.\nWe own assets that are subject to long-term ground leases. These ground leases may impose limitations on our use of the properties, restrict our ability to finance, sell or otherwise transfer our interests or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to operate the properties. In addition, we could lose our interests in the properties if the ground leases are breached by us, terminated or lapse. As we get closer to the lease termination dates, the values of the properties could decrease if we are unable to agree upon an extension of the lease with the lessor. Certain of these ground leases have payments subject to annual escalations and/or periodic fair market value adjustments which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations.\nLand we hold with no current intent to develop may be subject to future impairment charges.\nWe own land parcels that we do not currently intend to develop. As discussed in Item 2. “Properties—Other Land and Real Estate Assets,” in the event that the fair market value less the cost to dispose of a parcel changes such that it is less than the carrying basis of the parcel, we would be subject to an impairment charge, which would reduce our net income.\nRisks related to liquidity and financing\nCapital and credit market conditions may adversely affect our access to various sources of capital and/or the cost of capital, which could impact our business activities, dividends, earnings and common stock price, among other things.\nIn periods when the capital and credit markets experience significant volatility, the amounts, sources and cost of capital available to us may be adversely affected. We primarily use external financing to fund construction and to refinance indebtedness as it matures. If sufficient sources of external financing are not available to us on cost effective terms, we could be forced to limit our development and redevelopment activity and/or take other actions to fund our business activities and\n11\nrepayment of debt, such as selling assets, reducing our cash dividend or issuing equity. If we are able and/or choose to access capital at a higher cost than we have experienced in recent years, our earnings per share and cash flows could be adversely affected. In addition, the price of our common stock may fluctuate significantly and/or decline in a high interest rate environment or a volatile economic environment, or if we dilute the interest of stockholders by issuing additional equity. We believe that the lenders under our Credit Facility will fulfill their lending obligations thereunder, but if economic conditions deteriorate, the ability of those lenders to fulfill their obligations may be adversely impacted.\nInsufficient cash flow could affect our debt financing and create refinancing risk.\nWe are subject to the risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that our available cash will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest on our debt. For us to continue to qualify as a REIT, we are required to annually distribute dividends generally equal to at least 90% of our REIT taxable income, which limits the amount of our cash flow available to meet required principal and interest payments. The principal outstanding balance on a portion of our debt will not be fully amortized prior to its maturity. We cannot assure you that we will have sufficient cash flows available to make all required principal payments. Therefore, we expect that we will generally need to refinance at least a portion of our outstanding debt as it matures. There is a risk that we may not be able to refinance existing debt or that a refinancing will not be done on as favorable terms; either of these outcomes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations.\nRising interest rates could increase interest costs and could affect the market price of our common stock, and efforts to hedge such risk could be ineffective and cause us to incur additional costs.\nIf interest rates increase, our interest costs on variable rate debt will rise unless we have hedged the risk of rising interest rates. In addition, an increase in market interest rates may lead purchasers of our common stock to demand a greater annual dividend yield, which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nFrom time to time we use interest rate derivatives to hedge and manage our exposure to certain interest rate risks. For example, when we anticipate issuing debt securities, we may seek to limit our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates prior to debt issuance by entering into interest rate hedging contracts. Although these agreements may partially protect against rising interest rates, they also may reduce the benefits to the Company if interest rates decline. The settlement or termination of interest rate hedging contracts may involve material charges to our earnings including net costs, such as transaction fees, settlement costs and/or breakage costs. In addition, our use of interest rate hedging arrangements may expose us to additional risks, including a risk that a counterparty to a hedging arrangement may fail to honor its obligations. Developing and implementing an interest rate risk strategy is complex and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations and there can be no assurance that our hedging activities will be effective.\nBond financing and zoning and other compliance requirements could limit our income, restrict the use of communities and cause favorable financing to become unavailable.\nWe have financed some of our apartment communities with obligations issued by local government agencies because the interest paid to the holders of this debt is generally exempt from federal income taxes, which typically provides a more favorable interest rate for us. These obligations are commonly referred to as “tax-exempt bonds” and generally must be secured by mortgages on our communities. As a condition to obtaining tax-exempt financing, or as a condition to obtaining favorable zoning or an agreement relating to property taxes in some jurisdictions, we will commit to make some of the apartments in a community available to households whose income does not exceed certain thresholds (e.g., 50% or 80% of area median income), or who meet other qualifying tests. As of December 31, 2021, 4.9% of our apartment homes at current operating communities were under income limitations such as these. These commitments, which may or may not expire, may limit our ability to raise rents and, as a consequence, adversely affect the value of the communities subject to these restrictions. If we fail to observe these commitments, we could lose benefits (such as reduced property taxes) or face liabilities including liability for the benefits we received under tax exempt bonds, tax credits or agreements related to property taxes.\nSome of our tax-exempt bond financing documents require us to obtain a guarantee from a financial institution of payment of the principal and interest on the bonds. The guarantee may take the form of a letter of credit, surety bond, guarantee agreement or other additional collateral. If the financial institution defaults in its guarantee obligations, or if we are unable to renew the applicable guarantee or otherwise post satisfactory collateral, a default will occur and the community could be foreclosed upon if we do not redeem the tax exempt bonds.\nRisks related to indebtedness.\nWe have a Credit Facility with a syndicate of commercial banks. Our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that may be incurred. Accordingly, subject to compliance with outstanding debt covenants, we\n12\ncould incur more debt, resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and an increase in debt service requirements that could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nThe mortgages on properties that are subject to secured debt, our Credit Facility and the indentures under which a substantial portion of our debt was issued contain customary restrictions, requirements and other limitations, as well as certain financial and operating covenants including maintenance of certain financial ratios. Maintaining compliance with these restrictions could limit our flexibility. A default in these requirements, if uncured, could result in a requirement that we repay indebtedness, which could materially adversely affect our liquidity and increase our financing costs. Refer to Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” for further discussion.\nA substantial portion of our debt is subject to prepayment penalties or premiums that we will be obligated to pay in the event that we elect to prepay the debt prior to the earlier of (i) its stated maturity or (ii) another stated date. If we elect to prepay a significant amount of outstanding debt, our prepayment penalties or payments under these provisions could materially adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR and transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects.\nIn 2018, the Alternative Reference Rate Committee (the \"AARC\") recommended the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”) as the alternative to LIBOR. SOFR is a broad measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by U.S. Treasury securities, published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. While we expect LIBOR to be available in substantially its current form until at least the end of June 30, 2023, it is possible that LIBOR will become unavailable prior to that point. Due to the broad use of LIBOR as a reference rate, the impact of this transition on the interest rates charged to the Company could possibly adversely affect our financing costs, including spread pricing on our Credit Facility and variable rate unsecured term loans (the \"Term Loans\") and certain other floating rate debt obligations, as well as our operations and cash flows. Additionally, although SOFR is the AARC's recommended replacement rate, it is also possible that lenders may instead choose alternative replacement rates that may differ from LIBOR in ways similar to SOFR or in ways that would result in higher interest costs for us. It is not yet possible to predict the magnitude of LIBOR's end on our borrowing costs given the remaining uncertainty about which rate(s) will replace LIBOR.\nFailure to maintain our current credit ratings could adversely affect our cost of funds, related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nThere are two major debt rating agencies that routinely evaluate and rate our debt. Their ratings are based on a number of factors, which include their assessment of our financial strength, liquidity, capital structure, asset quality, amount of real estate under development, and sustainability of cash flow and earnings, among other factors. If market conditions change, we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings, which could adversely affect our cost of funds and related margins, liquidity and access to capital markets.\nThe form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions in future periods may vary and be impacted by our revenue generation, other liquidity needs and economic and other considerations.\nThe form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on our rental revenue, actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and other factors as the Board of Directors may consider relevant. The Board of Directors may modify our dividend policy from time to time.\nWe may experience barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit financial flexibility.\nPotential difficulties in promptly selling real estate at prices we find acceptable may limit our ability to quickly change or reduce the apartment communities in our portfolio in response to changes in economic, regulatory, or other conditions. Federal tax laws may also limit our ability to sell properties when desired. See “Risks related to our REIT or tax status” section for more information on federal tax law risks.\nRisks related to ongoing operations of our communities\nRent control and other changes in applicable laws, or noncompliance with applicable laws, could adversely affect our operations or expose us to liability.\nWe must develop, construct and operate our communities in compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations, some of which may conflict with one another or be subject to limited judicial or regulatory interpretations. These laws and regulations\n13\nmay include zoning laws, building codes, landlord/tenant laws and other laws generally applicable to business operations. Noncompliance with laws could expose us to liability. Lower revenue growth or significant unanticipated expenditures may result from our need to comply with changes in (i) laws imposing remediation requirements or other conditions, (ii) rent control or rent stabilization laws or other residential landlord/tenant laws, or (iii) other governmental rules and regulations or enforcement policies affecting the development, use and operation of our communities, including changes to building codes and fire and life-safety codes.\nWe have seen a recent increase in states and municipalities implementing, considering or being urged by advocacy groups to consider rent control or rent stabilization laws and regulations or take other actions that could limit the amount by which we can raise rents or charge non-rent fees. For example, in 2019 the State of California adopted statewide rent control for communities older than fifteen years, limiting rent increases to the lesser of 10% or 5% plus local CPI. Also in 2019 the State of New York adopted new rules for rent-controlled and rent-stabilized units that revised and limited the way rent increases are calculated for renewal leases, basing increases solely on rent actually paid and eliminating the ability to increase the renewal rent to a higher “registered rent.” Furthermore, in California the Governor has the ability to enact local or statewide states of emergency which limit our ability to increase new and renewal rents more than 10% over the rent in place on the date such state of emergency was declared, which has impacted some of our California communities. Current and future enactments of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multi-family housing may limit our ability to charge market rents, increase rents, evict tenants or recover increases in our operating expenses and could make it more difficult for us to dispose of properties in certain circumstances. Expenses associated with our investment in these communities, such as debt service, real estate taxes, insurance and maintenance costs, are generally not reduced when circumstances cause a reduction in rental income from the community.\nShort-term leases expose us to the effects of declining market rents.\nSubstantially all of our apartment leases are for a term of one year or less. Because these leases generally permit the residents to leave at the end of the lease term without penalty, our rental revenues are impacted by declines in market rents more quickly than if our leases were for longer terms.\nCompetition could limit our ability to lease apartment homes or increase or maintain rents.\nOur apartment communities compete with other apartment operators as well as rental housing alternatives, such as single-family homes for rent and short term furnished offerings such as those available from extended stay hotels or through on-line listing services. In addition, our residents and prospective residents also consider, as an alternative to renting, the purchase of a new or existing condominium or single-family home. Competitive residential housing could adversely affect our ability to lease apartment homes and to increase or maintain rental rates.\nUnfavorable changes in market and economic conditions could adversely affect occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, and the overall market value of our real estate assets.\nLocal conditions in our markets significantly affect occupancy, rental rates and the operating performance of our communities, and may be adversely affected by the following risks:\n•\ncorporate restructurings and/or layoffs, and industry slowdowns;\n•\nan oversupply of, or a reduced demand for, apartment homes;\n•\na decline in household formation or employment or lack of employment growth;\n•\nthe inability or unwillingness of residents to pay rent increases; and\n•\neconomic conditions that could cause an increase in our operating expenses, such as increases in property taxes, utilities, compensation of on-site associates and routine maintenance.\nRisks related to commercial operations\nAlthough we are primarily in the multifamily rental business, we also own and lease ancillary commercial space. Gross rental revenue provided by leased commercial space in our portfolio represented 1.4% of our total revenue in 2021. The long term nature of our commercial leases and characteristics of many of our tenants (small, local businesses) may subject us to certain risks. We may not be able to lease new space for rents that are consistent with our projections or at market rates. Also, when leases for our existing commercial space expire, the space may not be relet or the terms of reletting, including the cost of allowances and concessions to tenants, may be less favorable than the current lease terms. Our properties compete with other properties with commercial space. The presence of competitive alternatives may affect our ability to lease space and the level of rents we can obtain. If our commercial tenants experience financial distress or bankruptcy, they may fail to comply with their contractual obligations, seek concessions in order to continue operations or cease their operations, which could adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition.\n14\nRisks related to our REIT or tax status\nFailure to qualify as a REIT would cause us to be taxed as a corporation, which would significantly reduce funds available for distribution to stockholders.\nIf we fail to qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, we will be subject to regular federal corporate income tax on our taxable income. In addition, unless we are entitled to relief under applicable statutory provisions, we would be ineligible to make an election for treatment as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year we lose our qualification. The additional tax liability resulting from the failure to qualify as a REIT would significantly reduce or eliminate the amount of funds available for distribution to our stockholders. Furthermore, we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders. Thus, our failure to qualify as a REIT could also impair our ability to expand our business and raise capital and would adversely affect the value of our common stock.\nWe believe that we are organized and qualified as a REIT, and we intend to operate in a manner that will allow us to continue to qualify as a REIT. However, we cannot assure you that we are qualified as a REIT, or that we will remain qualified in the future. This is because qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the Code for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations and involves the determination of a variety of factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control. Our qualification as a REIT depends on our satisfaction of certain asset, income, organizational, distribution, shareholder ownership and other requirements on a continuing basis. In addition, future legislation, new regulations, administrative interpretations or court decisions may significantly change the tax laws or the application of the tax laws with respect to qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes or the federal income tax consequences of this qualification.\nEven if we qualify as a REIT, we will be subject to certain federal, state and local taxes on our income and property and on taxable income that we do not distribute to our stockholders. In addition, we hold certain assets and engage in certain activities through our taxable REIT subsidiaries that a REIT could not engage in directly. We also use taxable REIT subsidiaries to hold certain assets that we believe would be subject to the 100% prohibited transaction tax if sold at a gain outside of a taxable REIT subsidiary or to engage in activities that generate non-qualifying REIT income. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to federal income tax as regular corporations.\nWe may choose to pay dividends in our own stock, in which case stockholders may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash they receive.\nWe may distribute taxable dividends that are payable in part in our stock. Taxable stockholders receiving such dividends will be required to include the full amount of the dividend as income to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes. As a result, a U.S. stockholder may be required to pay tax with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash dividend received. If a U.S. stockholder sells the stock it receives as a dividend in order to pay this tax, the sales proceeds may be less than the amount included in income with respect to the dividend, depending on the market price of our stock at the time of the sale. Furthermore, with respect to non-U.S. stockholders, we may be required to withhold U.S. tax with respect to such dividends, including in respect of all or a portion of such dividend that is payable in stock. In addition, the trading price of our stock would experience downward pressure if a significant number of our stockholders sell shares of our stock in order to pay taxes owed on dividends.\nWe may experience regulatory and federal tax barriers to selling apartment communities that could limit financial flexibility.\nFederal tax laws may limit our ability to earn a gain on the sale of a community (unless we own it through a subsidiary which will incur a taxable gain upon sale) if we are found to have held, acquired or developed the community primarily with the intent to resell the community, and this limitation may affect our ability to sell communities without adversely affecting returns to our stockholders.\nFrom time to time we dispose of properties in transactions intended to qualify as “like-kind exchanges” under Section 1031 of the Code. If a transaction intended to qualify as a Section 1031 exchange is later determined to be taxable, we may face adverse tax consequences, and if the laws applicable to such transactions are amended or repealed, we may not be able to dispose of properties on a tax deferred basis.\nWe may be subject to adverse legislative or regulatory tax changes that could reduce the market price of our common stock or debt securities.\n15\nAt any time, the federal income tax laws governing REITs or the administrative interpretations of those laws may be amended. We cannot predict when or if any new federal income tax law, regulation, or administrative interpretation, or any amendment to any existing federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation, will be adopted, promulgated or become effective and any such law, regulation, or interpretation may take effect retroactively. We and our stockholders and holders of our debt securities could be adversely affected by any such change in, or any new, federal income tax law, regulation or administrative interpretation.\nRisks that may not be insured in full or in part\nWe are exposed to risks that are either uninsurable, not economically insurable or in excess of our insurance coverage, including risks discussed below.\nInsurance coverage for various risks can be costly and in limited supply. As a result, we may experience shortages in desired coverage levels if market conditions are such that insurance is not available or the cost of insurance makes it, in the Company's view, economically impractical. Incidents that directly or indirectly damage our communities, both physically and financially, or cause losses that exceed our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations including increased maintenance, repair, and delays in construction. In addition, we would also continue to be obligated to repay any mortgage indebtedness or other obligations related to the community which could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations. The following risks are uninsurable or insurance coverage is limited due to premium rates (See Item 2. “Properties—Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses”):\n•\nEarthquake risk.\nAs further described in Item 2. “Properties—Insurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses,” many of our West Coast communities are located in the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Insurance coverage for earthquakes can be costly and in limited supply.\n•\nClimate and severe or inclement weather risk.\nMany of our markets, particularly those located in coastal cities, are exposed to risks associated with inclement or severe weather including those arising from climate change such as hurricanes, severe winter storms and coastal flooding.\n•\nTerrorism and other risk.\nWe have significant investments in large metropolitan markets, such as Metro New York/New Jersey and Washington, D.C., which have in the past been or may in the future be the target of actual or threatened terrorist attacks. We carry commercial general liability insurance, property insurance and terrorism insurance with respect to our communities on terms and in amounts we consider commercially reasonable. There are, however, certain types of losses (such as losses arising from acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in the Company's view, economically impractical.\nWe may incur costs related to climate change.\nTo the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. In addition, changes in federal, state and local regulations based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures or operating expenses on our existing properties (for example, requiring retrofitting of existing systems) and our new development properties (for example, to improve energy efficiency, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and/or improve resistance to inclement weather) without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.\nWe may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance.\nUnder various public health laws and regulations, we may be required, regardless of knowledge or responsibility, to investigate and remediate the presence or effects of hazardous or toxic substances such as asbestos, lead paint, chemical vapors from soils or groundwater, petroleum product releases, and natural substances such as methane and radon gas. We may be held liable under these laws or common law to a governmental entity or to third parties for property, personal injury or natural resources damages and for investigation and remediation costs incurred as a result of the contamination. These damages and costs may be substantial and may exceed any insurance coverage we have for such events. The presence of these substances, or the failure to properly remediate or contain the contamination, may adversely affect our ability to borrow against, develop, sell or rent the affected property. In addition, some environmental laws create or allow a government agency to impose a lien on the contaminated site in favor of the government for damages and costs it incurs as a result of the contamination.\nThe development, construction and operation of our communities are subject to regulations and permitting under various federal, state and local laws, regulations and ordinances, which regulate matters including wetlands protection, storm water runoff and wastewater discharge. These laws and regulations may impose restrictions on the manner in which our communities\n16\nmay be developed, and noncompliance with these laws and regulations may subject us to fines and penalties and may subject us to liability in connection with personal injury.\nCertain laws and regulations govern the removal, encapsulation or disturbance of asbestos containing materials (“ACMs”) when such materials are in poor condition or in the event of renovation or demolition of a building. These laws and the common law may impose liability for release of ACMs and may allow third parties to seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with exposure to ACMs. We are not aware that any ACMs were used in the construction of the communities we developed. ACMs were, however, used in the construction of a number of the communities that we have acquired. Although we implement an operations and maintenance program at each of the communities at which ACMs are detected, we may fail to adequately observe such program or a disturbance of ACMs may occur nevertheless, exposing us to liability. We are aware that some of our communities have lead paint and have implemented an operations and maintenance program at each of those communities.\nAll of our stabilized operating communities, and all of the communities that we are currently developing, have been subjected to at least a Phase I or similar environmental assessment, which generally does not involve invasive techniques such as soil or groundwater sampling. These assessments, together with subsurface assessments conducted on some properties, have not revealed, and we are not otherwise aware of, any environmental conditions that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our business, assets, financial condition or results of operations. In connection with our ownership, operation and development of communities, from time to time we undertake substantial remedial action in response to the presence of subsurface or other contaminants, including contaminants in soil, groundwater and soil vapor beneath or affecting our buildings. In some cases, an indemnity exists upon which we may be able to rely if environmental liability arises from the contamination or remediation costs exceed estimates. There can be no assurance, however, that all necessary remediation actions have been or will be undertaken at our properties or that we will be indemnified, in full or at all, in the event that environmental liability arises.\nMold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. Certain molds may in some instances lead to adverse health effects, including allergic or other reactions. We cannot provide assurance that mold or excessive moisture will be detected and remediated in a timely manner. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities that may exceed any applicable insurance coverage.\nAdditionally, we have occasionally been involved in developing, managing, leasing and operating various properties for third parties. Consequently, we may be considered to have been an operator of such properties and, therefore, potentially liable for removal or remediation costs or other potential costs which relate to the release or presence of hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum products at such properties.\nWe cannot assure you that:\n•\nthe environmental assessments described above have identified all potential environmental liabilities;\n•\nno prior owner created any material environmental condition not known to us or the consultants who prepared the assessments;\n•\nno environmental liabilities have developed since the environmental assessments were prepared;\n•\nthe condition of land or operations in the vicinity of our communities, such as the presence of underground storage tanks, will not affect the environmental condition of our communities;\n•\nfuture uses or conditions, including, without limitation, changes in applicable environmental laws and regulations, will not result in the imposition of environmental liability; and\n•\nno environmental liabilities will arise at communities that we have sold for which we may have liability.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe ability of our stockholders to control our policies and effect a change of control of our company is limited by certain provisions of our charter and bylaws and by Maryland law.\nThere are provisions in our charter and bylaws that may discourage a third party from making a proposal to acquire us. These provisions include the following:\nOur charter authorizes our Board of Directors to issue up to 50,000,000 shares of preferred stock without stockholder approval and to establish the preferences and rights, including voting rights, of any series of preferred stock issued. This could allow the Board to issue one or more classes or series of preferred stock that could discourage or delay a tender offer or a change in control.\n17\nTo maintain our qualification as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, not more than 50% in value of our outstanding stock may be owned, directly or indirectly, by or for five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any taxable year. To maintain this qualification, and/or to address other concerns about concentrations of ownership of our stock, our charter generally prohibits ownership (directly, indirectly by virtue of the attribution provisions of the Code, or beneficially as defined in Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act) by any single stockholder of more than 9.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of any class or series of our stock. In general, under our charter, pension plans and mutual funds may directly and beneficially own up to 15% of the outstanding shares of any class or series of stock. Under our charter, our Board of Directors may in its sole discretion waive or modify the ownership limit for one or more persons, but it is not required to do so even if such waiver would not affect our qualification as a REIT. These ownership limits may prevent or delay a change in control and, as a result, could adversely affect our stockholders' ability to realize a premium for their shares of common stock.\nAs a Maryland corporation, we are subject to the provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law. Maryland law restricts some business combinations and requires compliance with statutory procedures before some mergers and acquisitions may occur, which may delay or prevent offers to acquire us or increase the difficulty of completing any offers, even if they are in our stockholders' best interests. In addition, other provisions of the Maryland General Corporation Law permit the Board of Directors to make elections and to take actions without stockholder approval (such as classifying our Board such that the entire Board is not up for re-election annually) that, if made or taken, could have the effect of discouraging or delaying a change in control.\nChanges in U.S. accounting standards may materially and adversely affect the reporting of our operations.\nThe Company follows accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (“GAAP”). GAAP is established by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”), an independent body whose standards are recognized by the SEC as authoritative for publicly held companies. The FASB and the SEC create and interpret accounting standards and may issue new accounting pronouncements or change the interpretation and application of these standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements. These changes could have a material impact on our reported consolidated results of operations and financial position.\nWe rely on information technology in our operations, and any breach, interruption or security failure of that technology, or any non-compliance with applicable laws with respect to the use of that technology, could have a negative impact on our business, results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation.\nInformation security risks have generally increased in recent years due to the rise in new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyber attacks.\nWe collect and hold personally identifiable information of our residents and prospective residents in connection with our leasing and property management activities, and we collect and hold personally identifiable information of our associates in connection with their employment. In addition, we engage third party service providers that may have access to such personally identifiable information in connection with providing necessary information technology and security and other business services to us.\nThere can be no assurance that we will be able to prevent unauthorized access to this information. Any failure in or breach of our operational or information security systems, or those of our third party service providers, as a result of cyber attacks or information security breaches, could result in a wide range of potentially serious harm to our business operations and financial prospects, including (among others) disruption of our business and operations, disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information (including personal information of our residents and/or associates), damage to our reputation, and/or potentially significant legal and/or financial liabilities and penalties.\nVarious laws and regulations and interpretations thereof, as well as agreements with payment processors, require, or may require, us to comply with rules related to our websites for use by residents and prospective residents, including requirements related to accessibility of our websites to persons with disabilities and our handling and use of data we collect. We could face liabilities for failure to comply with these requirements. New statutes, such as the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), and related regulations are evolving and may be subject to differing interpretations. We could incur costs to comply with stricter and more complex data privacy, data collection and information security laws and standards.\nOur success depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to attract and retain the services of executive officers and other personnel. Our executive officers make important capital allocation decisions or recommendations to our Board of Directors from among the\n18\nopportunities identified by our regional offices. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel in the real estate industry, and the loss of our key personnel could adversely affect the Company."

    "text": "Our real estate investments consist primarily of current operating apartment communities (\"Current Communities\"), consolidated and unconsolidated communities in various stages of development (\"Development\" communities and \"Unconsolidated Development\" communities) and Development Rights (as defined below). Our Current Communities are further classified as Same Store communities, Other Stabilized communities, Lease-Up communities, Redevelopment communities and Unconsolidated communities. While we generally establish the classification of communities on an annual basis, we update the classification of communities during the calendar year to the extent that our plans with regard to the disposition or redevelopment of a community change. The following is a description of each category:\nCurrent Communities\nare categorized as Same Store, Other Stabilized, Lease-Up, Redevelopment, or Unconsolidated according to the following attributes:\n•\nSame Store\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 is composed of consolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the respective prior year period. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Same Store communities are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2020, are not conducting or are not probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale or probable for disposition to unrelated third parties within the current year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of 90% physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.\n•\nOther Stabilized\nis composed of completed consolidated communities that we own and that are not Same Store but which have stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as of January 1, 2021, or which were acquired subsequent to January 1, 2020. Other Stabilized includes stabilized operating communities in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dallas, Texas, the two new expansion markets we entered in 2021, but excludes communities that are conducting or are probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the current year, as defined below.\n•\nLease-Up\nis composed of consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and that do not have stabilized occupancy.\n•\nRedevelopment\nis composed of consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the current year. Redevelopment is considered substantial when (i) capital invested during the reconstruction effort is expected to exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 or 10% of the community's pre-redevelopment basis and (ii) physical occupancy is below or is expected to be below 90% during, or as a result of, the redevelopment activity.\n•\nUnconsolidated\nis composed of communities that we have an indirect ownership interest in through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture.\nDevelopment\nis composed of consolidated communities that are either currently under construction, or were under construction and were completed during the current year. These communities may be partially or fully complete and operating.\nUnconsolidated Development\nis composed of communities that are either currently under construction, or were under construction and were completed during the current year, in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated joint venture. These communities may be partially or fully complete and operating.\nDevelopment Rights\nare development opportunities in the early phase of the development process where we either have an option to acquire land or enter into a leasehold interest, where we are the buyer under a long-term conditional contract to purchase land, where we control the land through a ground lease or own land to develop a new community, or where we are the designated developer in a public-private partnership. We capitalize related pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new developments for which we currently believe future development is probable.\nWe currently lease our corporate headquarters located in Arlington, Virginia, as well as our other regional and administrative offices, under operating leases.\n20\nAs of December 31, 2021, communities that we owned or held a direct or indirect interest in were classified as follows:\nOur holdings under each of the above categories are discussed on the following pages.\n21\nWe generally establish the composition of our Same Store communities portfolio annually. Changes in the Same Store communities portfolios for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n_________________________________\n(1)    We remove a community from our Same Store portfolio if we believe that planned activity for the upcoming year will result in that community's expected operations not being comparable to the prior year, including (i) when we intend to undertake a significant capital renovation, such that the community will be classified as a Redevelopment community; (ii) when we intend to dispose of a community; or (iii) when a significant casualty loss occurs.\n(2)    Community was moved from the Same Store portfolio to the Other Stabilized portfolio as a result of a casualty loss that occurred during the year and impacted operations.\nCurrent Communities\nOur Current Communities include garden-style apartment communities consisting of multi-story buildings of stacked flats and/or townhome apartments in landscaped settings, as well as mid and high rise apartment communities consisting of larger elevator-served buildings of four or more stories, frequently with structured parking. As of January 31, 2022, our Current Communities consisted of the following:\nAs discussed in Item 1. “Business,” we operate under four core brands:\nAvalon, AVA,\ne\naves by Avalon\nand\nKanso .\nWe believe that this branding differentiation allows us to target our product offerings to multiple customer groups and submarkets within our existing geographic footprint.\nWe also have an extensive and ongoing maintenance program to continually maintain and enhance our communities and apartment homes. The aesthetic appeal of our communities, and a service-oriented property management team that is focused on the specific needs of residents, enhances market appeal. We believe our mission of\nCreating a Better Way To Live\nhelps us achieve higher rental rates and occupancy levels while minimizing resident turnover and operating expenses.\nOur Current Communities are located in the following geographic markets:\n22\nWe manage and operate substantially all of our Current Communities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed construction of nine communities containing 2,752 apartment homes and sold 11 operating communities containing 2,933 apartment homes. The age of our Current Communities, on a weighted average basis according to number of apartment homes, is 19.7 years. When adjusted to reflect redevelopment activity, as if redevelopment were a new construction completion date, the weighted average age of our Current Communities is 10.6 years.\nOf the Current Communities, as of January 31, 2022, we owned (directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries):\n•\n266 operating communities, including 259 with a full fee simple, or absolute, ownership interest and seven that are on land subject to a land lease. The land leases have various expiration dates from July 2046 to April 2106, and three of the land leases are used to support tax advantaged structures that ultimately allow us to purchase the land upon lease expiration.\n23\n•\nA general partnership interest in Archstone Multifamily Partners AC LP (the “U.S. Fund”), subsidiaries of which own three operating communities.\n•\nA membership interest in four limited liability companies. One of the ventures, the NYTA MF Investors LLC, through subsidiaries owns a fee simple interest in three operating communities and a leasehold interest in two additional operating communities. The other three ventures that each hold a fee simple interest in an operating community, one of which is consolidated for financial reporting purposes.\n•\nA general partnership interest in one partnership structured as a “DownREIT,” which is consolidated and owns one community. In this partnership, one of our wholly-owned subsidiaries is the general partner. Limited partners are entitled to receive an initial distribution before any distribution is made to the general partner. The distributions per unit paid to the holders of units of limited partnership interests are equal to our current common stock dividend amount. The limited partnership interests have the right to present all or some of their units for redemption for a cash amount based on the fair value of our common stock. In lieu of a cash redemption by the partnership, we may elect to acquire any unit presented for redemption for one share of our common stock. At January 31, 2022, there were 7,500 DownREIT partnership units outstanding.\nIn addition to our Current Communities, we also hold, directly or through wholly-owned subsidiaries, a full fee simple ownership interest in our wholly-owned Development Communities, a membership interest in two limited liability companies that each hold an interest in an Unconsolidated Development Community, and a wholly-owned mixed-use project with for-sale condominiums.\nDevelopment Communities\nAs of December 31, 2021, we owned or held a direct interest in 17 Development Communities under construction. We expect these Development Communities, when completed, to add a total of 5,386 apartment homes and 40,000 square feet of commercial space to our portfolio for a total capitalized cost, including land acquisition costs, of approximately $2,140,000,000. We cannot assure you that we will meet our schedule for construction completion or that we will meet our budgeted costs, either individually, or in the aggregate. You should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for a discussion of the risks associated with development activity and our discussion under Item 7. “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” (including the factors identified under “Forward-Looking Statements”) for further discussion of development activity.\nThe following table presents a summary of the Development Communities.\n24\n_________________________________\n(1)\nProjected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be or actually incurred to develop the respective Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions.\n(2)\nInitial projected occupancy dates are estimates.\n(3)\nStabilized operations is defined as the earlier of (i) attainment of 90% or greater physical occupancy or (ii) the one-year anniversary of completion of development.\n(4)\nAvalon Harrison contains 27,000 square feet of commercial space.\n(5)\nThis is a densification of the existing eaves Redmond Campus operating community, where 48 existing older apartment homes were demolished and will be replaced by a new Avalon branded 214 apartment home community.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed the development of the following wholly-owned communities:\n25\n____________________________________\n(1)\nTotal capitalized cost is as of December 31, 2021. We generally anticipate incurring additional costs associated with these communities that are customary for new developments.\n(2)\nAVA Hollywood at La Pietra Place contains 19,000 square feet of commercial space.\nUnconsolidated Development Communities\nDuring 2020, we entered into a joint venture to develop, own, and operate AVA Arts District, an apartment community located in Los Angeles, CA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 475 apartment homes and 56,000 square feet of commercial space when completed. We own a 25.0% interest in the venture and contributed our total required equity investment of $30,436,000. The venture has secured a $167,147,000 variable rate construction loan to fund approximately 60% of the development of AVA Arts District, of which $11,581,000 has been drawn as of December 31, 2021. We have guaranteed the construction loan on behalf of the venture, and any obligations under the construction loan guarantee, except for obligations arising from our misconduct, are required capital contributions of the partners based on ownership interest.\nIn addition, we have a 50.0% interest in Avalon Alderwood MF Member, LLC, a joint venture to develop, own, and operate Avalon Alderwood Mall, a 328 apartment home community located in Lynnwood, WA. Avalon Alderwood Mall, which is currently under construction, began leasing in 2021 with physical occupancy of 8% as of December 31, 2021.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had an indirect interest in the following Unconsolidated Development Communities.\n_____________________________\n(1)\nProjected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs projected to be incurred to develop the respective Unconsolidated Development Community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees and other regulatory fees, as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial tenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions. Projected total capitalized cost is the total projected joint venture amount.\n26\nUnconsolidated Operating Communities\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had investments in the following unconsolidated real estate entities accounted for under the equity method of accounting, excluding development joint ventures. See Note 5, “Investments,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report, which includes information on the aggregate assets, liabilities and equity, as well as operating results, and our proportionate share of their operating results. For ventures holding operating apartment communities as of December 31, 2021, detail of the real estate and associated indebtedness underlying our unconsolidated investments is presented in the following table (dollars in thousands).\n_________________________________\n(1)\nWe have not guaranteed the debt of these unconsolidated investees and bear no responsibility for the repayment unless otherwise disclosed.\n(2)\nBorrowing on this community is comprised of two mortgage loans. The interest rate is the weighted average interest rate as of December 31, 2021.\n(3)\nBorrowing on this dual-branded community is comprised of a single mortgage loan.\nDuring 2021, the Archstone Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the \"AC JV\") sold Avalon North Point and Avalon North Point Lofts, its final two communities containing an aggregate of 529 apartment homes, for an aggregate sales price of $325,000,000. Our share of the gain was $23,305,000. In conjunction with the disposition of Avalon North Point, the AC JV repaid a $111,653,000 loan to the equity investors in the venture at par.\n27\nDevelopment Rights\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $147,546,000 in acquisition and related capitalized costs for direct interests in seven land parcels we own. In addition, we had $40,414,000 in capitalized costs (including legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs) related to (i) 14 Development Rights for which we control the land parcel, typically through a conditional agreement or option to purchase or lease the land, as well as (ii) costs incurred for three Development Rights that are additional development phases of existing stabilized operating communities we own and which will be constructed on land currently adjacent to or directly associated with those operating communities for which we own the land. Collectively, the land held for development and associated costs for deferred development rights relate to 24 Development Rights for which we expect to develop new apartment communities in the future. The Development Rights range from those beginning design and architectural planning to those that have completed site plans and drawings and can begin construction almost immediately. We estimate that the successful completion of all of these communities would ultimately add approximately 8,070 apartment homes to our portfolio. Substantially all of these apartment homes will offer features like those offered by the communities we currently own.\nThe properties comprising the Development Rights are in different stages of the due diligence and regulatory approval process. The decisions as to which of the Development Rights to invest in, if any, or to continue to pursue once an investment in a Development Right is made, are business judgments that we make after we perform financial, demographic and other analyses. In the event that we do not proceed with a Development Right, we generally would not recover any of the capitalized costs incurred in the pursuit of those communities, unless we were to recover amounts in connection with the sale of land; however, we cannot guarantee a recovery. Pre-development costs incurred in the pursuit of Development Rights, for which future development is not yet considered probable, are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any unrecoverable capitalized pre-development costs are charged to expense. During 2021, we incurred a charge of $3,231,000 for expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, which include development pursuits that were not yet probable of future development at the time incurred, or for pursuits that we determined were no longer probable of being developed.\nYou should carefully review Item 1A. “Risk Factors,” for a discussion of the risks associated with Development Rights.\nLand Acquisitions\nWe select land for development and follow established procedures that we believe minimize both the cost and the risks of development. During 2021, we acquired the following land parcels for an aggregate investment of $174,224,000.\n28\n____________________________________\n(1)\nProjected total capitalized cost includes all capitalized costs incurred to date (if any) and projected to be incurred to develop the respective community, determined in accordance with GAAP, including land and related acquisition costs, construction costs, real estate taxes, capitalized interest and loan fees, permits, professional fees, allocated development overhead and other regulatory fees, as well as costs incurred for first generation commercial\ntenants such as tenant improvements and leasing commissions, net of projected proceeds for any planned sales of associated outparcels and other real estate.\n(2)\nConstruction on this land parcel commenced during 2021.\nDisposition Activity\nWe sell assets when they do not meet our long-term investment strategy or when real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our periods of ownership, and we generally redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop, redevelop and acquire communities. Pending such redeployment, we will generally use the proceeds from the sale of these communities to reduce amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility or retain the cash proceeds on our balance sheet until it is redeployed into acquisition, development or redevelopment activity. On occasion, we will set aside the proceeds from the sale of communities into a cash escrow account to facilitate a tax-deferred, like-kind exchange transaction. From January 1, 2021 to January 31, 2022, we sold our interest in nine wholly-owned operating communities, containing 2,404 apartment homes, with an aggregate gross sales price of $867,200,000.\nInsurance and Risk of Uninsured Losses\nWe maintain commercial general liability insurance and property insurance with respect to all of our communities, with insurance policies issued by a combination of third party insurers as well as a wholly-owned captive insurance company. These policies, along with other insurance policies we maintain, have policy specifications, insured and self-insured limits, exclusions and deductibles that we consider commercially reasonable. We utilize a wholly-owned captive insurance company to insure certain types and amounts of risks, which include property damage and resulting business interruption losses, general liability insurance and other construction related liability risks. The captive is utilized to insure other limited levels of risk, which may be in part reinsured by third party insurance. There are, however, certain types of losses (including, but not limited to, losses arising from nuclear liability, pandemic or acts of war) that are not insured, in full or in part, because they are either uninsurable or the cost of insurance makes it, in management’s view, economically impractical. You should carefully review the discussion under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K for a discussion of risks associated with an uninsured property or casualty loss.\nOur communities are insured for certain property damage and business interruption losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies and/or a master property insurance program which covers the majority of our communities. This master property program provides a $400,000,000 limit for any single occurrence and annually in the aggregate, subject to certain sub-limits and exclusions. Under the master property program, we are subject to various deductibles per occurrence, as well as additional self-insured retentions. In addition to our potential liability for the various policy self-insured retentions and deductibles, our captive insurance company is directly responsible for 100% of the first $25,000,000 of losses (per occurrence) and 10% of the second $25,000,000 of losses (per occurrence) incurred by the master property insurance policy. Our master property insurance program includes coverage for losses resulting from customary perils, including but not limited to wildfires and windstorms. Limits, deductibles, self-insured retentions and coverages may increase or decrease annually during the insurance renewal process, which occurs on different dates throughout the calendar year.\nMany of our West Coast communities are located within the general vicinity of active earthquake faults. Many of our communities are near, and thus susceptible to, the major fault lines in California, including the San Andreas Fault, the Hayward Fault or other geological faults that are known or unknown. We cannot assure you that an earthquake would not cause damage or losses greater than our current insured levels. We procure property damage and resulting business interruption insurance coverage with a loss limit of $175,000,000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate for losses resulting from earthquakes. However, for any losses resulting from earthquakes at communities located in California or Washington, the loss limit is $200,000,000 for any single occurrence and in the annual aggregate.\nOur Southeast Florida communities are in wind exposed locations that could be impacted by significant storm events like hurricanes. We include coverage for losses arising from these types of weather events within our master property insurance program.\n29\nOur communities are insured for third-party liability losses through a combination of community specific insurance policies and/or coverage provided under a master commercial general liability and umbrella/excess insurance program. The master commercial general liability and umbrella/excess insurance policies cover the majority of our communities and are subject to certain coverage limitations and exclusions. After applicable self-insured retentions borne by us, our captive insurance company is directly responsible for the first $2,000,000 of losses (per occurrence) covered by the master general liability insurance policy.\nWe also maintain certain casualty policies (general liability, umbrella/excess and workers compensation) for construction related risks that have various exclusions and deductibles that, in management’s view, are commercially reasonable.\nJust as with office buildings, transportation systems and government buildings, apartment communities could become targets of terrorism. Our communities are insured for terrorism related losses through the Terrorism Risk Insurance Program Reauthorization Act (“TRIPRA”) program. This coverage extends to most of our casualty exposures (subject to deductibles and insured limits) and certain property insurance policies. We have also purchased private-market insurance for property damage due to terrorism with limits of $600,000,000 per occurrence and in the annual aggregate that includes certain coverages (not covered under TRIPRA) such as domestic-based terrorism. This insurance, often referred to as “non-certified” terrorism insurance, is subject to deductibles, limits, and exclusions.\nAn additional consideration for insurance coverage and potential uninsured losses is mold growth or other environmental contamination. Mold growth may occur when excessive moisture accumulates in buildings or on building materials, particularly if the moisture problem remains undiscovered or is not addressed over a period of time. If a significant mold problem arises at one of our communities, we could be required to undertake a costly remediation program to contain or remove the mold from the affected community and could be exposed to other liabilities. For further discussion of the risks and our related prevention and remediation activities, please refer to the discussion under Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors - We may incur costs due to environmental contamination or non-compliance” elsewhere in this report. We cannot provide assurance that we will have coverage under our existing policies for property damage or liability to third parties arising as a result of exposure to mold or a claim of exposure to mold at one of our communities.\nWe also maintain other insurance programs that provide coverage for events including but not limited to employee dishonesty, loss of data, and liability associated with management of certain employee benefit plans. These policies are subject to maximum loss limits and include coverage limitations or exclusion that may preclude us from fully recovering.\nThe amount or types of insurance we maintain may not be sufficient to cover all losses and we may change our policy limits, coverages, and self-insured retentions at any time.\n30"

On January 31, 2022 there were 431 holders of record of an aggregate of 139,752,486 shares of our outstanding common stock. The number of holders does not include individuals or entities who beneficially own shares but whose shares are held of record by a broker or clearing agency, but does include each such broker or clearing agency as one record holder.\nAt present, we expect to continue our policy of paying regular quarterly cash dividends. However, the form, timing and/or amount of dividend distributions will be declared at the discretion of the Board of Directors and will depend on actual cash from operations, our financial condition, capital requirements, the annual distribution requirements under the REIT provisions of the Code and other factors as the Board of Directors may consider relevant.

Purchases of common stock under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be exercised from time to time in the Company’s discretion and in such amounts as market conditions warrant. The timing and actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice.\nInformation regarding securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans is included in the section entitled Item 12. “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters” in this Form 10-K."

This MD&A should be read in conjunction with our Consolidated Financial Statements and the accompanying Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report. This report, including the following MD&A, contains forward-looking statements regarding future events or trends that should be read in conjunction with the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” included in this report. Actual results or developments could differ materially from those projected in such statements as a result of the factors described under “Forward-Looking Statements” as well as the risk factors described in Part I, Item 1A. “Risk Factors” of this report.\nCapitalized terms used without definition have the meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K.\nExecutive Overview\n2021 Financial Highlights\nNet income attributable to common stockholders for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,004,299,000, an increase of $176,669,000, or 21.3%, over the prior year. The increase is primarily attributable to increases in real estate sales and related gains, as well as increased NOI in the current year from Development and newly acquired communities. These amounts were partially offset by a decrease in NOI from Same Store and communities sold in 2020 and 2021, and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year.\nSame Store NOI attributable to our apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary residential revenue (\"Residential\"), for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,370,282,000, a decrease of $66,283,000, or 4.6%, from the prior year. The decrease was due to a decrease in rental revenue of $45,643,000, or 2.2%, as well as an increase in property operating expenses of $20,300,000, or 3.2%, over 2020.\nDuring 2021, we raised approximately $2,138,184,000 of gross capital through the issuance of unsecured notes; sale of common shares under our fifth continuous equity program (\"CEP V\"); and the sale of nine consolidated operating communities, condominiums at The Park Loggia and other real estate. This amount does not include our share of proceeds from joint venture dispositions. We believe that our current capital structure will continue to provide financial flexibility to access capital on attractive terms.\nWe believe our development activity will continue to create long-term value. During 2021, we:\n•\nCompleted the construction of nine consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 2,752 apartment homes and 29,000 square feet of commercial space, for an aggregate total capitalized cost of $1,070,000,000.\n•\nStarted the construction of 10 consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 3,010 apartment homes, which are expected to be completed for an estimated total capitalized cost of $1,246,000,000.\nWe also achieved portfolio growth through acquisitions, acquiring seven consolidated apartment communities containing an aggregate of 1,932 apartment homes and 90,000 square feet of commercial space for an aggregate purchase price of $724,500,000.\nWe believe that our balance sheet strength, as measured by our current level of indebtedness, our current ability to service interest and other fixed charges, and our current moderate use of financial encumbrances (such as secured financing), provide us with adequate access to liquidity from the capital markets. We expect to be able to meet our reasonably foreseeable liquidity needs, as they arise, through a combination of one or more of the following sources: existing cash on hand; operating cash flows; borrowings under our Credit Facility; secured debt; the issuance of corporate securities (which could include unsecured debt, preferred equity and/or common equity); the sale of apartment communities; or through the formation of joint ventures. See the discussion under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\n33\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted our business operations to address the safety of and financial impacts on our residents and associates, including, in certain jurisdictions (i) providing flexible lease renewal options, (ii) creating payment plans for residents who are impacted by COVID-19 and (iii) waiving late fees and certain other customary fees associated with apartment rentals. To the extent still implemented, we may discontinue these measures at any time except where required by law.\nThe impact on our consolidated results of operations from COVID-19 for future periods will depend, among other factors, on (i) the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government to address COVID-19 and any variants and relieve the economic distress of consumers, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent, and (ii) the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact our collections and associated outstanding receivables, with the impact partially mitigated by payments received under government rent relief programs. The following table presents, for our 2021 Same Store communities for the periods presented, the percentages of the following charges to residents that we have collected, including (i) apartment base rent and (ii) other rentable items, such as parking and storage rent, along with pet and other recurring fees in accordance with residential leases (collectively, \"Collected Residential Revenue,\" which excludes transactional fees). Included in collections are $28,286,000 of aggregate rent relief payments received for our Same Store portfolio during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n_________________________\n(1)\nCollections are for our 2021 Same Store communities and exclude commercial revenue, which was 1.0% of our 2021 Same Store total revenue.\n(2)\nThe Collected Residential Revenue percentage as of the last day in the respective quarter.\n(3)\nThe percentage of Collected Residential Revenue as of January 31, 2022.\n(4)\nCollected Residential Revenue for January 2022 as of January 31, 2022 was 93.0%.\nThe collection rates are based on resident activity as reflected in our property management systems and are presented to provide information about collections trends during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the collections information provided was not routinely produced for internal use by senior management or publicly disclosed by the Company and is a result of analysis that is not subject to internal controls over financial reporting. This information is not prepared in accordance with GAAP, does not reflect GAAP revenue or cash flow metrics and may be subject to adjustment in preparing GAAP revenue and cash flow metrics. Additionally, this information should not be interpreted as predicting the Company’s financial performance, results of operations or liquidity for any period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, t\nhe\noutstanding rent receivable balance for residential and commercial tenants, net of reserves, was $18,594,000 and $18,159,000, respectively.\nCommunities Overview\nAs of December 31, 2021 we owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in 297 apartment communities containing 87,992 apartment homes in 12 states and the District of Columbia, of which 17 consolidated communities were under development and one community was under redevelopment. We have an indirect interest in 12 of the 297 apartment communities which were owned by entities that were not consolidated for financial reporting purposes, including two that are being developed within joint ventures. In addition, we held a direct or indirect ownership interest in Development Rights to develop an additional 24 communities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated 8,070 apartment homes.\nOur real estate investments consist primarily of Current Communities, Development communities, Unconsolidated Development communities and Development Rights. Our Current Communities are further classified as Same Store\n34\ncommunities, Other Stabilized communities, Lease-Up communities, Redevelopment communities and Unconsolidated communities.\nSame Store communities are consolidated communities that were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the prior year, allowing for a meaningful comparison of operating results between years. Other Stabilized communities are generally all other completed consolidated communities that have stabilized occupancy at the beginning of the current year or were acquired during the year. Lease-Up communities are consolidated communities where construction has been complete for less than one year and does not have stabilized occupancy. Redevelopment communities are consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the fiscal year. Unconsolidated communities are communities in which we have an indirect ownership interest through our investment interest in an unconsolidated entity. A more detailed description of our reportable segments and other related operating information can be found in Note 8, “Segment Reporting,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAlthough each of these categories is important to our business, we generally evaluate overall operating, industry and market trends based on the operating results of Same Store communities, for which a detailed discussion can be found in “Results of Operations” as part of our discussion of overall operating results. We evaluate our current and future cash needs and future operating potential based on acquisition, disposition, development, redevelopment and financing activities within Other Stabilized, Redevelopment and Development communities. Discussions related to current and future cash needs and financing activities can be found under \"Liquidity and Capital Resources.\"\nNOI of our current operating communities is one of the financial measures that we use to evaluate the performance of our communities. NOI is affected by the demand and supply dynamics within our markets, our rental rates and occupancy levels and our ability to control operating costs. Our overall financial performance is also impacted by the general availability and cost of capital and the performance of newly developed, redeveloped and acquired apartment communities.\n35\nResults of Operations\nOur year-over-year operating performance is primarily affected by both overall and individual geographic market conditions and apartment fundamentals and is reflected in changes in Same Store NOI; NOI derived from acquisitions, development completions and development under construction and in lease-up; loss of NOI related to disposed communities; and capital market and financing activity. In addition, as discussed above under “Executive Overview - COVID-19 Pandemic” and elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic continues to affect our business, and may continue to do so. See also Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.” Discussion of our operating results for 2020 and comparison to 2019 can be found in Item 7. \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in the Company's Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021. A comparison of our operating results for 2021 and 2020 follows (dollars in thousands).\n_________________________________\n(1)     Percent change is not meaningful.\nNet income attributable to common stockholders\nincreased $176,669,000, or 21.3%, to $1,004,299,000 in 2021 over 2020, primarily due to an increase in gains on consolidated and unconsolidated real estate dispositions in the current year, partially offset by a decrease in Same Store NOI and an increase in depreciation expense in the current year.\n36\nNOI\nis considered by management to be an important and appropriate supplemental performance measure to net income because it helps both investors and management to understand the core operations of a community or communities prior to the allocation of any corporate-level or financing-related costs. NOI reflects the operating performance of a community and allows for an easier comparison of the operating performance of individual assets or groups of assets. In addition, because prospective buyers of real estate have different financing and overhead structures, with varying marginal impact to overhead as a result of acquiring real estate, NOI is considered by many in the real estate industry to be a useful measure for determining the value of a real estate asset or group of assets. We define NOI as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, net, loss on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, depreciation expense, income tax expense (benefit), casualty and impairment loss, gain on sale of communities, gain on other real estate transactions, net, net for-sale condominium activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale.\nNOI does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance. NOI should also not be considered an alternative to net cash flow from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity, nor is NOI indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. Residential NOI represents results attributable to the Company's apartment rental operations, including parking and other ancillary residential revenue. Reconciliations of NOI and Residential NOI for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 to net income for each year are as follows (dollars in thousands):\n_________________________\n(1)\nRepresents results attributable to the non-apartment components of our mixed-use communities and other non-residential operations (\"Commercial\").\n37\nThe Residential NOI changes for 2021 as compared to 2020 consists of changes in the following categories (dollars in thousands):\nThe decrease in our Residential Same Store NOI in 2021 is due to a decrease in rental revenue of $45,643,000, or 2.2% and an increase in property operating expenses of $20,300,000, or 3.2%, over 2020.\nRental and other income\ndecreased $5,676,000, or 0.2%, in 2021 compared to the prior year primarily due to decreased rental rates, amortization of concessions at our Same Store communities and decreased rental income from dispositions, partially offset by additional rental income generated from development completions and development under construction and in lease-up and acquisitions, increased occupancy at our Same Store communities and a decrease in commercial uncollectible lease revenue.\nAs discussed elsewhere in this report, the COVID-19 pandemic, and direct and indirect related economic, regulatory and operating impacts, are likely to continue to adversely affect our rental revenue. Deteriorating financial conditions among our residents and commercial tenants, as well as regulations that limit our ability to evict residents and tenants, may continue to result in higher than normal uncollectible lease revenue. The pandemic may also continue to depress demand among consumers for our apartments for a variety of other reasons, including (i) if consumers decide to live in markets that are less costly than ours for one or more reasons, such as a decline in their income, remote working arrangements, or if they cannot freely access neighborhood amenities like restaurants, gyms and entertainment venues; (ii) that consumers who would otherwise rent may seek home ownership; and (iii) ongoing downward pressures on demand for certain types of housing (e.g., corporate apartment homes) or by certain consumers (e.g. students or consumers who require seasonal job-related demand such as in the entertainment industry).\nConsolidated Communities—The weighted average number of occupied apartment homes for consolidated communities increased to 75,744 apartment homes for 2021, as compared to 73,724 homes for 2020. The weighted average monthly rental revenue per occupied apartment home decreased to $2,518 for 2021 as compared to $2,593 in 2020.\nSame Store rental revenue decreased $35,671,000, or 1.7%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year.\n•\nResidential rental revenue decreased $45,643,000, or 2.2%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year, including an offsetting decrease in uncollectible lease revenue of $2,227,000. See below for a table detailing the change in Same Store Residential rental revenue by market for the year ended December 31, 2021, including the attribution of the change between rental rates and Economic Occupancy (as defined below).\n•\nAs a result of the pandemic, we increased our use of residential concessions during 2021 and 2020 relative to concessions granted prior to 2020. Concessions for our Same Store communities granted in 2021 decreased from the prior year by $6,209,000 to $42,237,000. Concessions granted in 2021 remain at elevated levels relative to years prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Concessions are amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the respective leases (generally one year) and contributed to the overall decline in our Same Store rental revenue in 2021. The amortization of residential concessions for our Same Store communities increased by $38,190,000 in 2021 as compared to the prior year, and the remaining net unamortized balance of residential concessions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $14,209,000 and $30,272,000, respectively.\n•\nCommercial rental revenue increased $9,972,000, or 87.9%, for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year due to a reduction in uncollectible lease revenue of $11,826,000, for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n38\nThe following table presents the change in Same Store Residential rental revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to the prior year:\nThe following table presents the change in Same Store Residential rental revenue, including the attribution of the change between rental rates and Economic Occupancy for the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands).\n_________________________________\n(1)   Economic occupancy takes into account the fact that apartment homes of different sizes and locations within a community have different economic impacts on a community's gross revenue. Economic occupancy is defined as gross potential revenue less vacancy loss, as a percentage of gross potential revenue. Gross potential revenue is determined by valuing occupied homes at leased rates and vacant homes at market rents. Vacancy loss is determined by valuing vacant units at current market rents.\nDirect property operating expenses, excluding property taxes\nincreased $20,465,000, or 4.6%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, as well as the timing of repairs and maintenance projects previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nSame Store Residential direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, represents 99.9% of total Same Store operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021. Residential direct property operating expenses, excluding property taxes, increased $14,759,000, or 3.7%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the timing of repairs and maintenance projects previously delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nProperty taxes\nincreased $9,900,000, or 3.6%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities and increased assessments for the Company's stabilized portfolio, partially offset by decreased property taxes from dispositions.\nSame Store Residential property taxes represents 98.8% of total Same Store property taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021. For Same Store, property taxes increased $5,541,000, or 2.3%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to increased assessments across the portfolio, increased rates in California and Metro NY/NJ and the expiration of certain property tax incentive programs in New York City in the current year, partially offset by successful appeals in 2021 in New York, California and Florida.\n39\nExpensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries\nprimarily reflect costs incurred for development pursuits not yet considered probable for development, as well as the abandonment of Development Rights and costs related to abandoned acquisition and disposition pursuits and any recoveries of costs incurred. These costs can be volatile, particularly in periods of increased acquisition pursuit activity, periods of economic downturn or when there is limited access to capital, and therefore may vary significantly from year to year. In addition, the timing for potential recoveries will not always align with the timing for expensing an abandoned pursuit. Expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, decreased $9,168,000, or 73.9%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The amount for 2020 includes the write-off of $7,264,000 related to a Development Right in New York City.\nInterest expense, net\nincreased $6,264,000, or 2.9%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year. This category includes interest costs offset by capitalized interest pertaining to development and redevelopment activity, amortization of premium/discount on debt, interest income and any mark to market impact from derivatives not in qualifying hedge relationships. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to a decrease in capitalized interest and an increase in the amount of unsecured indebtedness, partially offset by lower overall effective rates on unsecured indebtedness and a combination of a decrease in variable rates on, and amounts of, secured indebtedness.\nLoss on extinguishment of debt, net\nreflects (i) prepayment penalties and (ii) the write-off of unamortized deferred financing costs, premiums/discounts and deferred hedging losses from our debt repurchase and retirement activity. The losses on extinguishment of debt, net of $17,787,000 and $9,333,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were primarily due to the repayments of unsecured notes during each of those years.\nDepreciation expense\nincreased $51,265,000, or 7.2%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to the addition of newly developed and acquired apartment communities, partially offset by dispositions.\nGeneral and administrative expense\n(“G&A”) increased $9,268,000, or 15.4%, in 2021 as compared to the prior year, primarily due to legal settlement proceeds that were present in the prior year, coupled with increases in the current year of compensation related expenses, including executive transition costs, during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nCasualty and impairment loss\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 of $3,119,000 consists of a $1,971,000 charge recognized for the damages across several communities in our East Coast markets related to severe storms and a $1,148,000 charge recognized for property and casualty damages resulting from a fire at an operating community.\nIncome from investments in unconsolidated entities\nincreased $32,163,000 in 2021 as compared to the prior year, due to unrealized gains on property technology investments recognized in the current year and the gain on the sale of the final two communities in Archstone Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the \"AC JV\"), partially offset by the gain on the sale of a community in Archstone Multifamily Partners AC LP (the \"U.S. Fund\") in the prior year.\nGain on sale of communities\nincreased in 2021 as compared to the prior year. The amount of gain realized in a given period depends on many factors, including the number of communities sold, the size and carrying value of the communities sold and the market conditions in the local area. The gains of $602,235,000 and $340,444,000 in 2021 and 2020, respectively, were primarily due to the sale of nine wholly-owned operating communities in both 2021 and 2020.\nGain on other real estate transactions, net\nrepresents the impact from the sale of land parcels and other tangible and intangible real estate assets, and increased $1,657,000, or 376.6%, in 2021 due to the sale of residential entitlements.\nNet for-sale condominium activity\nis a net expense of $977,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 and a net gain of $2,551,000 for the year ended December 31, 2020, and is comprised of the net gain before taxes on the sale of condominiums at The Park Loggia less the associated marketing, operating and administrative costs. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold 53 residential condominiums at The Park Loggia, for gross proceeds of $135,458,000, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $3,110,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we sold 70 residential condominiums at The Park Loggia for gross proceeds of $216,372,000, resulting in a gain in accordance with GAAP of $8,213,000. In addition, we incurred $4,087,000 and $5,662,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, in marketing, operating and administrative costs.\nIncome tax (expense) benefit\nof $5,733,000 for the year ended December 31, 2021 was related to activity generated through our taxable REIT subsidiaries (\"TRS\") and was comprised primarily of tax expense for condominium sales at The Park Loggia and other ancillary real estate. Income tax benefit for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to tax losses as well as provisions of the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the \"CARES Act\").\n40\nReconciliation of FFO and Core FFO\nConsistent with the definition adopted by the Board of Governors of the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts® (“Nareit”), we calculate Funds from Operations Attributable to Common Stockholders (\"FFO\") as net income or loss attributable to common stockholders computed in accordance with GAAP, adjusted for:\n•\ngains or losses on sales of previously depreciated operating communities;\n•\ncumulative effect of change in accounting principle;\n•\nimpairment write-downs of depreciable real estate assets;\n•\nwrite-downs of investments in affiliates due to a decrease in the value of depreciable real estate assets held by those affiliates;\n•\ndepreciation of real estate assets; and\n•\nsimilar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures, including those from a change in control.\nFFO and FFO adjusted for non-core items, or “Core FFO,” as defined below, are generally considered by management to be appropriate supplemental measures of our operating and financial performance. In calculating FFO, we exclude gains or losses related to dispositions of previously depreciated property and exclude real estate depreciation, which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates. FFO can help with the comparison of the operating and financial performance of a real estate company between periods or as compared to different companies. By further adjusting for items that are not considered by us to be part of our core business operations, Core FFO can help with the comparison of the core operating performance of the Company year over year. We believe that, in order to understand our operating results, FFO and Core FFO should be considered in conjunction with net income as presented in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income included elsewhere in this report.\nWe calculate Core FFO as FFO, adjusted for:\n•\njoint venture gains (if not adjusted through FFO), non-core costs and promoted interests from partnerships;\n•\ncasualty and impairment losses or gains, net on non-depreciable real estate;\n•\ngains or losses from early extinguishment of consolidated borrowings;\n•\ndevelopment pursuit write-offs and expensed transaction costs, net of recoveries;\n•\nthird-party business interruption insurance proceeds and the related lost NOI that is covered by the expected third party business interruption insurance proceeds;\n•\nproperty and casualty insurance proceeds and legal settlement activity;\n•\ngains or losses on sales of assets not subject to depreciation and other investment gains or losses;\n•\nadvocacy contributions, representing payments to promote our business interests;\n•\nhedge ineffectiveness or gains or losses from derivatives not designated as hedges for accounting purposes;\n•\nseverance related costs;\n•\nexecutive transition compensation costs;\n•\nnet for-sale condominium activity, including gains, marketing, operating and administrative costs and imputed carry cost;\n•\nincome taxes; and\n•\nother non-core items.\nFFO and Core FFO do not represent net income in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net income, which remains the primary measure, as an indication of our performance. In addition, FFO and Core FFO as calculated by other REITs may not be comparable to our calculations of FFO and Core FFO.\nFFO and Core FFO also do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with GAAP, and therefore should not be considered an alternative to net cash flows from operating activities, as determined by GAAP, as a measure of liquidity. Additionally, it is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs. A presentation of GAAP-based cash flow metrics is included in our Consolidated Financial Statements included elsewhere in this report.\nThe following is a reconciliation of net income attributable to common stockholders to FFO attributable to common stockholders and to Core FFO attributable to common stockholders for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands, except per share data).\n41\n_________________________________\n(1)    Amount for 2021 includes unrealized gains on property technology investments of $15,908, partially offset by the write-off of asset management fee intangibles associated with the disposition of the final two AC JV communities.\n(2)   Amount for 2020 includes the write-off of $7,264 related to a Development Right in New York City.\n(3)   The aggregate impact of (i) gain on for-sale condominiums and (ii) for-sale condominium marketing, operating and administrative costs is a net expense of $977 for 2021, and a net gain of $2,551 for 2020.\n(4)   Represents the imputed carry cost of for-sale residential condominiums at The Park Loggia. We computed this adjustment by multiplying the total capitalized cost of completed and unsold for-sale residential condominiums by our weighted average unsecured debt rate.\n(5)   Amount for 2021 relates to activity generated in our TRS and is comprised primarily of tax expense for condominium sales at The Park Loggia and other ancillary real estate. Amount for 2020 relates to tax losses as well as provisions of the CARES Act.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe employ a disciplined approach to our liquidity and capital management. When we source capital, we take into account both our view of the most cost effective alternative available and our desire to maintain a balance sheet that provides us with flexibility. Our principal focus on near-term and intermediate-term liquidity is to ensure we have adequate capital to fund:\n•\ndevelopment and redevelopment activity in which we are currently engaged or in which we plan to engage;\n•\nthe minimum dividend payments on our common stock required to maintain our REIT qualification under the Code;\n•\ndebt service and principal payments either at maturity or opportunistically before maturity;\n•\nnormal recurring operating expenses and corporate overhead expenses; and\n•\ninvestment in our operating platform, including strategic investments.\n42\nFactors affecting our liquidity and capital resources are our cash flows from operations, financing activities and investing activities (including dispositions) as well as general economic and market conditions. Cash flows from operations are determined by: operating activities and factors including but not limited to (i) the number of apartment homes currently owned, (ii) rental rates, (iii) occupancy levels, (iv) uncollectible lease revenue levels or interruptions in collections caused by market conditions and (v) operating expenses with respect to apartment homes. The timing and type of capital markets activity in which we engage is affected by changes in the capital markets environment, such as changes in interest rates or the availability of cost-effective capital. Our plans for development, redevelopment, non-routine capital expenditure, acquisition and disposition activity are affected by market conditions and capital availability. We frequently review our liquidity needs, especially in periods with volatile market conditions, as well as the adequacy of cash flows from operations and other expected liquidity sources to meet these needs.\nWe had cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow of $543,788,000 at December 31, 2021, an increase of $230,256,000 from $313,532,000 at December 31, 2020. The following discussion relates to changes in cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow due to operating, investing and financing activities, which are presented in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows included elsewhere in this report.\nOperating Activities—Net cash provided by operating activities decreased to $1,203,170,000 in 2021 from $1,219,615,000 in 2020, primarily due to a decrease in NOI.\nInvesting Activities—Net cash used in investing activities totaled $624,053,000 in 2021. The net cash used was primarily due to:\n•\nacquisition of seven operating communities for $771,692,000;\n•\ninvestment of $654,861,000 in the development and redevelopment of communities; and\n•\ncapital expenditures of $153,235,000 for our operating communities and non-real estate assets.\nThese amounts were partially offset by:\n•\nnet proceeds from the disposition of nine operating communities and ancillary real estate\nof $850,230,000; and\n•\nnet proceeds from the sale of for-sale residential condominiums of $124,532,000.\nFinancing Activities—Net cash used in financing activities totaled $348,861,000 in 2021. The net cash used was primarily due to:\n•\npayment of cash dividends in the amount of $888,344,000;\n•\nrepayment of unsecured notes in the amount of $462,147,000; and\n•\nmortgage notes repayments and principal amortization payments in the amount of $109,562,000.\nThese amounts were partially offset by:\n•\nproceeds from the issuance of unsecured notes in the amount of $1,098,643,000; and\n•\nthe issuance of common stock in the amount of $31,874,000 primarily through CEP V.\nVariable Rate Unsecured Credit Facility\nWe have a $1,750,000,000 revolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in February 2024. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility (e.g., one month to maturity, three months to maturity, etc.) and (ii) the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes. The current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is LIBOR plus 0.775% per annum (0.88% at January 31, 2022), assuming a one month borrowing rate. The annual facility fee for the Credit Facility remained at 0.125%, resulting in a fee of $2,188,000 annually based on the $1,750,000,000 facility size and based on our current credit rating.\n43\nWe had no borrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $6,969,000 outstanding in letters of credit that reduced our borrowing capacity as of January 31, 2022. In addition, we had $39,581,000 outstanding in additional letters of credit unrelated to the Credit Facility as of January 31, 2022.\nThe phase-out of LIBOR and expected transition to SOFR as a benchmark interest rate will have uncertain and possibly adverse effects on our LIBOR borrowings. See Item 1A. “Risk Factors” for further discussion.\nFinancial Covenants\nWe are subject to financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility, Term Loans and the indentures under which our unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:\n•\nlimitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;\n•\nlimitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and\n•\nminimum levels of debt service coverage.\nWe were in compliance with these covenants at December 31, 2021.\nIn addition, some of our secured borrowings include yield maintenance, defeasance, or prepayment penalty provisions, which would result in us incurring an additional charge in the event of a full or partial prepayment of outstanding principal before the scheduled maturity. These provisions in our secured borrowings are generally consistent with other similar types of debt instruments issued during the same time period in which our borrowings were secured.\nContinuous Equity Offering Program\nIn May 2019, we commenced CEP V under which we may sell (and/or enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of) up to $1,000,000,000 of our common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined, including market conditions, the trading price of our common stock and our determinations of the appropriate funding sources. We engaged sales agents for CEP V who receive compensation of up to 1.5% of the gross sales price for shares sold. We expect that, if entered into, we will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, and to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the forward sale price. However, we may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, we will pay the forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, a commission of up to 1.5% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. During 2021 and through January 31, 2022, we sold 122,343 shares of common stock at an average sales price of $226.15 per share, for net proceeds of $27,253,000 under this program. In addition, at December 31, 2021, we were party to a forward contract under CEP V to sell 68,577 shares of common stock for approximate proceeds of $16,000,000 net of offering fees and discounts based on the initial forward price, with settlement of the forward contract to occur on one or more dates not later than December 31, 2022. The final proceeds will be determined on the date(s) of settlement after adjustments for our dividends and a daily interest factor. As of January 31, 2022, we had $705,961,000 remaining authorized for issuance under this program, after consideration of the forward contract.\n44\nForward Interest Rate Swap Agreements\nThe following derivative activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n•\nWe terminated $150,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020, receiving a payment of $6,962,000. We recognized $2,894,000 of these proceeds as a gain in 2020 and $2,654,000 of these proceeds as a gain during the year ended December 31, 2021, included in interest expense, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n•\nIn conjunction with the issuance of our $700,000,000 2.05% unsecured notes due 2032 in September 2021, we settled $200,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2021, designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes, making a net payment of $2,211,000. We have deferred these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and are recognizing the impact as a component of interest expense, net, over the term of the respective hedged debt.\n•\nWe entered into an additional $150,000,000 of new forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2022.\nAt the maturity of the remaining outstanding swap agreements, we expect to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that we issue the debt as expected, the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment.\nStock Repurchase Program\nIn July 2020, our Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which we may acquire shares of our common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $500,000,000 (the \"2020 Stock Repurchase Program\"). Purchases of common stock under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be exercised at our discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During 2021 and through January 31, 2022, we had no repurchases of shares under this program. As of January 31, 2022, we had $316,148,000 remaining authorized for purchase under this program.\nFuture Financing and Capital Needs—Debt Maturities and Material Obligations\nOne of our principal long-term liquidity needs is the repayment of long-term debt at maturity. For both our unsecured and secured notes, a portion of the principal of these notes may be repaid prior to maturity. Early retirement of our unsecured or secured notes could result in gains or losses on extinguishment. If we do not have funds on hand sufficient to repay our indebtedness as it becomes due, it will be necessary for us to refinance or otherwise provide liquidity to satisfy the debt at maturity. This refinancing may be accomplished by uncollateralized private or public debt offerings, equity issuances, additional debt financing that is secured by mortgages on individual communities or groups of communities or borrowings under our Credit Facility. Although we believe we will have the capacity to meet our currently anticipated liquidity needs, we cannot assure you that capital from additional debt financing or debt or equity offerings will be available or, if available, that they will be on terms we consider satisfactory, especially in light of the uncertain impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on capital markets.\nThe following debt activity occurred during 2021:\n•\nIn January 2021, we repaid $27,795,000 principal amount of 5.37% fixed rate secured debt at par in advance of the April 2021 maturity date.\n•\nIn September 2021, we repaid $450,000,000 principal amount of our 2.95% unsecured notes in advance of the September 2022 scheduled maturity, recognizing a loss on debt extinguishment of $17,890,000, composed of a prepayment penalty of $12,147,000, and the non-cash write off of unamortized deferred hedging losses and unamortized deferred financing costs of $5,743,000.\n•\nIn September 2021, we issued $700,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately $694,617,000, before\n45\nconsidering the impact of other offering costs. The notes mature in January 2032 and were issued at a 2.05% interest rate. The notes were issued under our green bond framework, and we have allocated or will allocate the net proceeds, in whole or in part, to one or more new or existing eligible green projects.\n•\nIn November 2021, we repaid an aggregate of $73,060,000 principal amount of fixed rate secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of 3.79% at par in advance of the November 2036 maturity date.\n•\nIn November 2021, we issued $400,000,000 principal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under our existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately $396,976,000, before considering the impact of other offering costs. The notes mature in December 2028 and were issued at a 1.90% interest rate. The notes were issued under our green bond framework, and we have allocated or will allocate the net proceeds, in whole or in part, to one or more new or existing eligible green projects.\nThe following table details our consolidated debt obligations, including the effective interest rate and contractual maturity dates, and principal payments for periodic amortization and maturities for the next five years, excluding our Credit Facility and amounts outstanding related to communities classified as held for sale, for debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020 (dollars in thousands). We are not directly or indirectly (as borrower or guarantor) obligated in any material respect to pay principal or interest on the indebtedness of any unconsolidated entities in which we have an equity or other interest.\n46\n_________________________________\n(1)\nRates are given as of December 31, 2021 and include credit enhancement fees, facility fees, trustees’ fees, the impact of interest rate hedges, offering costs, mark to market amortization and other fees.\n(2)\nBalances outstanding represent total amounts due at maturity, and exclude deferred financing costs and debt discount for the unsecured notes of $50,606 and $47,995 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, deferred financing costs and debt discount associated with secured notes of $16,278 and $17,482 as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, as reflected on our Consolidated Balance Sheets included elsewhere in this report.\n(3)\nDuring 2021, we repaid this borrowing in advance of its scheduled maturity date.\n(4)\nFinanced by variable rate debt, but interest rate is capped through an interest rate protection agreement.\nIn addition to consolidated debt, we have scheduled contractual obligations associated with (i) ground leases for land underlying current operating or development communities and commercial and parking facilities and (ii) office leases for our corporate headquarters and regional offices of $14,879,000 for 2022, $14,642,000 for 2023 and $372,346,000 thereafter.\nFuture Financing and Capital Needs—Portfolio and Capital Markets Activity\nIn 2022, we expect to meet our liquidity needs from one or more of a variety of internal and external sources, which may include (i) real estate dispositions, (ii) cash balances on hand as well as cash generated from our operating activities, (iii) borrowing capacity under our Credit Facility and (iv) secured and unsecured debt financings. Additional sources of liquidity in 2022 may include the issuance of common and preferred equity. Our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to the real estate industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as the perception of lenders regarding our long or short-term financial prospects.\nBefore beginning new construction or reconstruction activity in 2022, including activity related to communities owned by unconsolidated joint ventures, we plan to source sufficient capital to complete these undertakings, although we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain such financing. In the event that financing cannot be obtained, we may have to abandon Development Rights, write off associated pre-development costs that were capitalized and/or forego reconstruction activity. In such instances, we will not realize the increased revenues and earnings that we expected from such Development Rights or reconstruction activity and significant losses could be incurred.\n47\nFrom time to time we use joint ventures to hold or develop individual real estate assets. We generally employ joint ventures primarily to mitigate asset concentration or market risk and secondarily as a source of liquidity. We may also use joint ventures related to mixed-use land development opportunities and new markets where our partners bring development and operational expertise and/or experience to the venture. Each joint venture or partnership agreement has been individually negotiated, and our ability to operate and/or dispose of a community in our sole discretion may be limited to varying degrees depending on the terms of the joint venture or partnership agreement. We cannot assure you that we will achieve our objectives through joint ventures.\nIn addition, we may invest, through mezzanine loans or other preferred equity investments, in multifamily development projects being undertaken by third parties. In these cases, we do not expect to acquire the underlying real estate but rather to earn a return on our investment (through interest or fixed rate preferred equity returns) and a return of the invested capital generally following completion of construction either on or before a set due date. As of January 31, 2022, we have not made any such investments but are pursuing opportunities.\nIn evaluating our allocation of capital within our markets, we sell assets that do not meet our long-term investment criteria or when capital and real estate markets allow us to realize a portion of the value created over our ownership periods and redeploy the proceeds from those sales to develop and redevelop communities. Because the proceeds from the sale of communities may not be immediately redeployed into revenue-generating assets that we develop, redevelop or acquire, the immediate effect of a sale of a community for a gain is to increase net income, but reduce future total revenues, total expenses and NOI until such time as the proceeds have been redeployed into revenue generating assets. We believe that the temporary absence of future cash flows from communities sold will not have a material impact on our ability to fund future liquidity and capital resource needs.\nInvestments\nWe invest in consolidated real estate entities, unconsolidated investments in real estate ventures and direct and indirect investments in technology and environmentally focused companies through investment management funds.\nConsolidated Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we acquired the following communities, which includes acquisitions marking our entry in the Texas and North Carolina expansion markets, containing 90,000 square feet of commercial space (dollars in thousands). See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for further discussion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we sold nine wholly-owned operating communities containing 2,404 apartment homes and 30,000 square feet of commercial space (dollars in thousands). See Note 6, \"Real Estate Disposition Activities,\" for further discussion.\n48\nUnconsolidated Investments\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we had the following investment activity related to our unconsolidated real estate and technology and environmentally focused investments. See Note 5, \"Investments,\" for further discussion.\n•\nArchstone Multifamily Partners AC JV LP (the \"AC JV\") sold its final two communities, Avalon North Point and Avalon North Point Lofts, located in Cambridge, MA, for $325,000,000. Our proportionate share of the gain in accordance with GAAP was $23,305,000. In conjunction with the disposition of Avalon North Point, the AC JV repaid a $111,653,000 loan made by equity investors in the venture at par.\n•\nArts District Joint Venture was formed to develop, own, and operate AVA Arts District, an apartment community located in Los Angeles, CA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 475 apartment homes and 56,000 square feet of commercial space when completed. We have a 25.0% ownership interest in the venture. As of December 31, 2021, excluding costs incurred in excess of equity in the underlying net assets of the venture, we have an equity investment of $30,436,000 in the venture. In addition to the equity contributions, the venture borrowed $11,581,000 under its $167,147,000 of the construction loan during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n•\nAvalon Alderwood MF Member, LLC (“Avalon Alderwood Mall”) was formed to develop, own, and operate Avalon Alderwood Mall, an apartment community located in Lynnwood, WA, which is currently under construction and expected to contain 328 apartment homes when completed. We have a 50.0% ownership interest in the venture. As of December 31, 2021, we have an equity investment of $55,054,000 in the venture, which represents substantially all of our required equity contributions.\n•\nWe invested $17,277,000 in various property technology and environmentally focused companies directly and indirectly through investment management funds. We have $39,890,000 of outstanding equity commitments to these investment management funds, with the timing and amount for these commitments to be fulfilled dependent on if, and when, investment opportunities are identified by the respective funds. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income and unrealized gains of $15,908,000 related to these investments, included as a component of Income from investments in unconsolidated entities on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nSupplemental U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations\nThe following discussion supplements and updates the disclosures under “Certain U.S. Federal Income Tax Considerations and Consequences of Your Investment\" in the prospectus dated February 25, 2021 contained in our Registration Statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021.\nThe second paragraph under the heading “-U.S. Taxation of Non-U.S. Stockholders-Distributions Attributable to Sale or Exchange of Real Property” is hereby deleted and replaced with the following:\nSubject to the following paragraph, we will be required to withhold and remit to the IRS 21% (or the then applicable highest corporate rate of U.S. federal income tax) of any distributions to non-U.S. stockholders attributable to gain from our sale or exchange of U.S. real property interests. Under long-standing regulations, we also may be required to withhold on any distributions to non-U.S. stockholders that we designate as capital gain dividends, including any distributions that could have been designated as capital gain dividends. Amounts so withheld are creditable against the\n49\nnon-U.S. stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability. A non-U.S. stockholder who receives distributions attributable to gain from a sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property interests will be required to file a U.S. federal income tax return for the taxable year.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K contains “forward-looking statements” as that term is defined under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. You can identify forward-looking statements by our use of the words “believe,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “intend,” “estimate,” “assume,” “project,” “plan,” “may,” “shall,” “will,” \"pursue\" and other similar expressions in this Form 10-K, that predict or indicate future events and trends and that do not report historical matters. These statements include, among other things, statements regarding our intent, belief or expectations with respect to:\n•\nthe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, results of operations and financial condition;\n•\nour potential development, redevelopment, acquisition or disposition of communities;\n•\nthe timing and cost of completion of apartment communities under construction, reconstruction, development or redevelopment;\n•\nthe timing of lease-up, occupancy and stabilization of apartment communities;\n•\nthe timing and net sales proceeds of condominium sales;\n•\nthe pursuit of land on which we are considering future development;\n•\nthe anticipated operating performance of our communities;\n•\ncost, yield, revenue, NOI and earnings estimates;\n•\nthe impact of landlord-tenant laws and rent regulations;\n•\nour expansion into new markets;\n•\nour declaration or payment of dividends;\n•\nour joint venture and discretionary fund activities;\n•\nour policies regarding investments, indebtedness, acquisitions, dispositions, financings and other matters;\n•\nour qualification as a REIT under the Code;\n•\nthe real estate markets in Metro New York/New Jersey, Northern and Southern California, Denver, Colorado, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas and Charlotte and Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, and markets in selected states in the Mid-Atlantic, New England and Pacific Northwest regions of the United States and in general;\n•\nthe availability of debt and equity financing;\n•\ninterest rates;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions, including the potential impacts from current economic conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\ntrends affecting our financial condition or results of operations; and\n•\nthe impact of outstanding legal proceedings.\nWe cannot assure the future results or outcome of the matters described in these statements; rather, these statements merely reflect our current expectations of the approximate outcomes of the matters discussed. We do not undertake a duty to update these forward-looking statements, and therefore they may not represent our estimates and assumptions after the date of this report. You should not rely on forward-looking statements because they involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors, some of which are beyond our control. These risks, uncertainties and other factors may cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from the anticipated future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements. You should carefully review the discussion under Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this report for further discussion of risks associated with forward-looking statements.\nRisks and uncertainties that might cause such differences include those related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including, among other factors, (i) the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government, including measures to relieve economic distress, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and (ii) the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic. In addition, the effects of the pandemic are likely to heighten the following risks, which we routinely face in our business.\nSome of the factors that could cause our actual results, performance or achievements to differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nwe may fail to secure development opportunities due to an inability to reach agreements with third parties to obtain land at attractive prices or to obtain desired zoning and other local approvals;\n50\n•\nwe may abandon or defer development opportunities for a number of reasons, including changes in local market conditions which make development less desirable, increases in costs of development, increases in the cost of capital or lack of capital availability, resulting in losses;\n•\nconstruction costs of a community may exceed our original estimates;\n•\nwe may not complete construction and lease-up of communities under development or redevelopment on schedule, resulting in increased interest costs and construction costs and a decrease in our expected rental revenues;\n•\nthe timing and net proceeds of condominium sales may not equal our current expectations;\n•\noccupancy rates and market rents may be adversely affected by competition and local economic and market conditions which are beyond our control;\n•\nfinancing may not be available on favorable terms or at all, and our cash flows from operations and access to cost effective capital may be insufficient for the development of our pipeline, which could limit our pursuit of opportunities;\n•\nthe impact of new landlord-tenant laws and rent regulations may be greater than we expect;\n•\nour cash flows may be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest, and we may be unable to refinance existing indebtedness or the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness;\n•\nwe may be unsuccessful in our management of joint ventures and the REIT vehicles that are used with certain joint ventures;\n•\nlaws and regulations implementing rent control or rent stabilization, or otherwise limiting our ability to increase rents, charge fees or evict tenants, may impact our revenue or increase our costs;\n•\nour expectations, estimates and assumptions as of the date of this filing regarding outstanding legal proceedings are subject to change; and\n•\nthe possibility that we may choose to pay dividends in our stock instead of cash, which may result in stockholders having to pay taxes with respect to such dividends in excess of the cash received, if any.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies, including making estimates and assumptions. If our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different, or different assumptions were made, it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied, resulting in different financial results or a different presentation of our financial statements. Below is a discussion of the accounting policies that we consider critical to an understanding of our financial condition and operating results that may require complex or significant judgment in their application or require estimates about matters which are inherently uncertain. A discussion of our significant accounting policies, including further discussion of the accounting policies described below, can be found in Note 1, “Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCost Capitalization\nWe capitalize costs during the development of assets. Capitalization begins when we determine that development of a future asset is probable and continues until the asset, or a portion of the asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use. For redevelopment efforts, we capitalize costs either (i) in advance of taking apartment homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun and continue until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment and continue until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating expenses incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are fully recognized in earnings as they accrue.\n51\nDuring the development and redevelopment efforts we capitalize all direct costs and indirect costs which have been incurred as a result of the development and redevelopment activities. These costs include interest and related loan fees, property taxes as well as other direct and indirect costs. Interest is capitalized for any project-specific financing, as well as for general corporate financing to the extent of our aggregate investment in the projects. Indirect project costs, which include personnel and office and administrative costs that are clearly associated with our development and redevelopment efforts, are also capitalized. Capitalized indirect costs associated with our development and redevelopment activities are comprised primarily of compensation related costs for associates dedicated to our development and redevelopment efforts and total $46,263,000 and $45,268,000 for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The estimation of the direct and indirect costs to capitalize as part of our development and redevelopment activities requires judgment and, as such, we believe cost capitalization to be a critical accounting estimate.\nThere may be a change in our operating expenses in the event that there are changes in accounting guidance governing capitalization or changes to our levels of development or redevelopment activity. If changes in the accounting guidance limit our ability to capitalize costs or if we reduce our development and redevelopment activities without a corresponding decrease in indirect project costs, there may be an increase in our operating expenses.\nWe capitalize pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of Development Rights. These costs include legal fees, design fees and related overhead costs. Future development of these pursuits is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and availability of capital. Pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development no longer probable, any capitalized pre-development costs are written off with a charge to expense.\nDue to the subjectivity in determining whether a pursuit will result in the development of an apartment community, and therefore should be capitalized, the accounting for pursuit costs is a critical accounting estimate. As of December 31, 2021, capitalized pursuit costs associated with Development Rights totaled $40,414,000.\nAbandoned Pursuit Costs & Asset Impairment\nWe evaluate our direct and indirect investments in real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may not be recoverable, we assess its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, we recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property. We assess land held for development for impairment if our intent changes with respect to the development of the land. We evaluate our unconsolidated investments for impairment, considering both the carrying value of the investment, estimated to be the expected proceeds that it would receive if the entity were dissolved and the net assets were liquidated, as well as our proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments.\nThe assessment of impairment can involve subjectivity in determining if indicators are present and in estimating the future undiscounted cash flows or the fair value of an asset. Estimates of the undiscounted cash flows are sensitive to significant assumptions including future rental revenues, operating expenses, and our intent and ability to hold the related asset, which could be impacted by our expectations about the future.\nWe expense costs related to abandoned pursuits, which include the abandonment of Development Rights and disposition pursuits. These costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future years.\nOur focus on value creation through real estate development presents an impairment risk in the event of a future deterioration of the real estate and/or capital markets or a decision by us to reduce or cease development. We cannot predict the occurrence of future events that may cause an impairment assessment to be performed, or the likelihood of any future impairment charges, if any. You should also review Item 1A. “Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K.\n52"

    "text": "We are exposed to market risks from our financial instruments primarily from changes in market interest rates. We do not have exposure to any other significant market risk. We monitor interest rate risk as an integral part of our overall risk management, which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations. Our operating results are affected by changes in interest rates, primarily in short-term LIBOR and the SIFMA index as a result of borrowings under our Credit Facility and outstanding bonds and unsecured notes with variable interest rates. In addition, the fair value of our fixed rate unsecured and secured notes are impacted by changes in market interest rates. The effect of interest rate fluctuations on our results of operations historically has been small relative to other factors affecting operating results, such as rental rates and occupancy.\nWe currently use interest rate protection agreements (consisting of interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements) for our risk management objectives, as well as for compliance with the requirements of certain lenders, and not for trading or speculative purposes. During 2021, we terminated $150,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020 and settled $200,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements in conjunction with our September 2021 unsecured note issuance that had been entered into during 2021. During 2021, we entered into an additional $150,000,000 of forward interest rate swap agreements to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of our expected debt issuance activity in 2022.\nIn addition, we have interest rate caps that serve to effectively limit the amount of interest rate expense we would incur on a floating rate borrowing. Further discussion of the financial instruments impacted and our exposure is presented below.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $714,150,000 and $720,850,000, respectively, in variable rate debt outstanding, with no amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility. If interest rates on the variable rate debt had been 100 basis points higher throughout 2021 and 2020, our annual interest incurred would have increased by approximately $7,716,000 and $8,289,000, respectively, based on balances outstanding during the applicable years.\nBecause the counterparties providing the interest rate cap and swap agreements are major financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group, we do not believe there is exposure at this time to a default by a counterparty provider.\nIn addition, changes in interest rates affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt, computed using quoted market prices for our unsecured notes or a discounted cash flow model for our secured notes, considering our current market yields, which impacts the fair value of our aggregate indebtedness. Debt securities and notes payable (including amounts outstanding under our Credit Facility) with an aggregate principal amount outstanding of $8,170,431,000 at December 31, 2021 had an estimated aggregate fair value of $8,565,339,000 at December 31, 2021. Contractual fixed rate debt represented $7,924,162,000 of the fair value at December 31, 2021. If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher as of December 31, 2021, the fair value of this fixed rate debt would have decreased by approximately $936,938,000."

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 25, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosure to which it relates.\nF-1\n/s/  Ernst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2002.\nTysons, Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2022\nF-2\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of AvalonBay Communities, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited AvalonBay Communities, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, AvalonBay Communities, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)(2) and our report dated February 25, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting in Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nTysons, Virginia\nFebruary 25, 2022\nF-3\nAVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-4\nAVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(Dollars in thousands, except per share data)\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-5\nAVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF EQUITY\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-6\nAVALONBAY COMMUNITIES, INC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(Dollars in thousands)\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-7\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash reported with the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows (dollars in thousands):\nSupplemental disclosures of non-cash investing and financing activities:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021:\n•\nAs described in Note 4, “Equity,” the Company issued\n155,836\nshares of common stock as part of the Company's stock-based compensation plans, of which\n56,545\nshares related to the conversion of performance awards to restricted shares of common stock, and the remaining\n99,291\nshares valued at $\n17,757,000\nwere issued in connection with new stock grants;\n2,844\nshares valued at $\n566,000\nwere issued through the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan;\n75,780\nshares valued at $\n13,463,000\nwere withheld to satisfy employees’ tax withholding and other liabilities;

(the “Company,” which term, unless the context otherwise requires, refers to AvalonBay Communities, Inc. together with its subsidiaries), is a Maryland corporation that has elected to be treated as a real estate investment trust (“REIT”) for federal income tax purposes under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”). The Company focuses on the development, redevelopment, acquisition, ownership and operation of multifamily communities in New England, the New York/New Jersey metro area, the Mid-Atlantic, the Pacific Northwest, and Northern and Southern California, as well as in the Company's expansion markets of Raleigh-Durham and Charlotte, North Carolina, Southeast Florida, Dallas and Austin, Texas, and Denver, Colorado.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in\n278\noperating apartment communities containing\n81,803\napartment homes in\n12\nstates and the District of Columbia. In addition, the Company owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in\n19\ncommunities under development that are expected to contain an aggregate of\n6,189\napartment homes (unaudited) when completed, as well as The Park Loggia, which contains\n172\nfor-sale residential condominiums, of which\n123\nhave been sold as of December 31, 2021, and\n66,000\nsquare feet of commercial space, of which\n87\n% has been leased as of December 31, 2021. The Company also owned or held a direct or indirect ownership interest in land or rights to land on which the Company expects to develop an additional\n24\ncommunities that, if developed as expected, will contain an estimated\n8,070\napartment homes (unaudited).\nCapitalized terms used without definition have meanings provided elsewhere in this Form 10-K\n.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of the Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries, certain joint venture partnerships, subsidiary partnerships structured as DownREITs and any variable interest entities that qualify for consolidation. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nThe Company accounts for joint venture entities and subsidiary partnerships in accordance with the consolidation guidance. The Company evaluates the partnership of each joint venture entity and determines first whether to follow the variable interest entity (“VIE”) or the voting interest entity (“VOE”) model. Once the appropriate consolidation model is identified, the Company then evaluates whether it should consolidate the venture. Under the VIE model, the Company consolidates an investment when it has control to direct the activities of the venture and the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The Company's maximum exposure for its VIEs is limited to its investments in the respective VIEs. Under the VOE model, the Company consolidates an investment when (i) it controls the investment through ownership of a majority voting interest if the investment is not a limited partnership or (ii) it controls the investment through its ability to remove the other partners in the investment, at its discretion, when the investment is a limited partnership.\nThe Company generally uses the equity method of accounting for its investment in joint ventures, including when the Company holds a noncontrolling limited partner interest in a joint venture. Any investment in excess of the Company's cost basis at acquisition or formation of an equity method venture, will be recorded as a component of the Company's investment in the joint venture and recognized over the life of the underlying fixed assets of the venture as a reduction to its equity in income from the venture. Investments in which the Company has little or no influence are accounted for using the measurement alternative with the carrying amount of the investment adjusted to fair value when there is an observable transaction indicating a change in fair value.\nF-10\nReal Estate\nOperating real estate assets are stated at cost and consist of land and improvements, buildings and improvements, furniture, fixtures and equipment, and other costs incurred during their development, redevelopment and acquisition. Significant expenditures which improve or extend the life of an existing asset and that will benefit the Company for periods greater than a year, are capitalized. Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred.\nProject costs related to the development, construction and redevelopment of real estate projects (including interest and related loan fees, property taxes and other direct costs) are capitalized as a cost of the project. Indirect project costs that relate to several projects are capitalized and allocated to the projects to which they relate. Indirect costs not clearly related to development, construction and redevelopment activity are expensed as incurred. For development, capitalization (i) begins when the Company has determined that development of the future asset is probable, (ii) can be suspended if there is no current development activity underway, but future development is still probable and (iii) ends when the asset, or a portion of an asset, is delivered and is ready for its intended use, or the Company's intended use changes such that capitalization is no longer appropriate.\nFor land parcels improved with operating real estate, for which the Company intends to pursue development, the Company generally manages the current improvements until such time as all tenant obligations have been satisfied or eliminated through negotiation, and construction of new apartment communities is ready to begin. Revenue from incidental operations received from the current improvements on land parcels in excess of any incremental costs are recorded as a reduction of total capitalized costs of the respective Development Right and not as part of net income. Incidental operating costs in excess of incidental operating income are expensed in the period incurred.\nFor redevelopment efforts, the Company capitalizes costs either (i) in advance of taking homes out of service when significant renovation of the common area has begun until the redevelopment is completed, or (ii) when an apartment home is taken out of service for redevelopment until the redevelopment is completed and the apartment home is available for a new resident. Rental income and operating costs incurred during the initial lease-up or post-redevelopment lease-up period are recognized in earnings as incurred.\nThe Company assesses acquisitions of operating communities to determine if it meets the definition of a business or if it qualifies as an asset acquisition. The Company generally views acquisitions of individual operating communities as asset acquisitions, which results in the capitalization of acquisition costs and the allocation of purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, based on the relative fair value of the respective assets and liabilities.\nThe purchase price allocation to tangible assets is reflected in real estate assets and depreciated over their estimated useful lives. Any purchase price allocation to intangible assets, other than in-place lease intangibles, is included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets and amortized over the term of the acquired intangible asset. The Company values land based on a market approach, looking to recent sales of similar properties, adjusting for differences due to location, the state of entitlement as well as the shape and size of the parcel. Improvements to land are valued using a replacement cost approach and consider the structures and amenities included for the communities and is reduced by estimated depreciation. The value for furniture, fixtures and equipment is also determined based on a replacement cost approach, considering costs for both items in the apartment homes as well as common areas and is adjusted for estimated depreciation. The fair value of buildings is estimated using the replacement cost approach, assuming the buildings were vacant at acquisition. The replacement cost approach considers the composition of structures acquired, adjusted for depreciation which considers industry standard information and estimated useful life of the acquired property. The value of the lease-related intangibles considers the estimated cost of leasing the apartment homes as if the acquired building(s) were vacant, as well as the value of the current leases relative to market-rate leases. The in-place lease value is determined using an average total lease-up time, the number of apartment homes and net revenues generated during the lease-up time. Net revenues use market rent considering actual leasing and industry rental rate data. The value of current leases relative to a market-rate lease is based on market comparables. Given the heterogeneous nature of multifamily real estate, the fair values for the land, debt, real estate assets and in-place leases incorporate significant unobservable inputs and therefore are considered to be Level 3 prices within the fair value hierarchy. Consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed.\nDepreciation is generally calculated on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings and related improvements range from\nseven years\nto\n30\nyears and for furniture, fixtures and equipment range from\nthree years\nto\nseven years\n.\nF-11\nFor-Sale Condominium Inventory\nThe Company presents for-sale condominium inventory at historical cost and evaluates the condominiums for impairment when potential indicators exist, as further discussed under \"Casualty and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\" below.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company elected to be treated as a REIT for federal income tax purposes for its tax year ended December 31, 1994 and has not revoked such election. A REIT is a corporate entity which holds real estate interests and can deduct from its federally taxable income qualifying dividends it pays if it meets a number of organizational and operational requirements, including a requirement that it distribute at least\n90\n% of its adjusted taxable income to stockholders. Therefore, as a REIT, the Company generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on its taxable income if it annually distributes\n100\n% of its taxable income to its stockholders.\nThe states in which the Company operates have similar tax provisions which recognize the Company as a REIT for state income tax purposes. Management believes that all such conditions for the exemption from income taxes on ordinary income have been or will be met for the periods presented. Accordingly, no provision for federal and state income taxes has been made. If the Company fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, it will be subject to federal corporate income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a corporate REIT for four subsequent taxable years. Even if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, the Company may be subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property, and to federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income and in certain other instances.\nThe Company did\nno\nt incur any charges or receive refunds of excise taxes related to the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nTaxable income from activities performed through taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRS”) is subject to federal, state and local income taxes. The Company recognized income tax expense of $\n5,733,000\nand $\n13,003,000\nin 2021 and 2019, respectively, and recorded an income tax benefit of $\n3,247,000\nin 2020 related to its activities through its TRSs. The income tax expense in 2021 and 2019 was primarily due to the disposition of the Company's for-sale condominiums and\ntwo\nwholly-owned operating communities. During 2020, the income tax expense was offset by net operating loss carryback provisions under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company did\nno\nt have any unrecognized tax benefits. The Company does not believe that there will be any material changes in its unrecognized tax positions over the next 12 months. The Company is subject to examination by the respective taxing authorities for the tax years 2018 through 2020.\nThe following summarizes the tax components of the Company's common dividends declared for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (unaudited):\nDeferred Financing Costs\nDeferred financing costs include fees and other expenditures necessary to obtain debt financing and are amortized on a straight-line basis, which approximates the effective interest method, over the shorter of the term of the loan or the related credit enhancement facility, if applicable. Unamortized financing costs are charged to earnings when debt is retired before the maturity date. Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs related to unsecured notes was $\n23,705,000\nand $\n25,239,000\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and related to mortgage notes payable was $\n2,300,000\nand $\n2,046,000\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deferred financing costs, except for costs associated with line-of-credit arrangements, are presented as a direct deduction from the related debt liability. Accumulated amortization of deferred financing costs related to the Company's Credit Facility was $\n15,187,000\nand $\n13,501,000\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and was included in prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nF-12\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Cash in Escrow\nCash and cash equivalents include all cash and liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less from the date acquired. Cash in escrow includes principal reserve funds that are restricted for the repayment of specified secured financing. The majority of the Company's cash, cash equivalents and cash in escrow are held at major commercial banks.\nInterest Rate Contracts\nThe Company utilizes derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk. See Note 11, “Fair Value,” for further discussion of derivative financial instruments.\nComprehensive Income\nComprehensive income, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, is defined as all changes in equity during each period except for those resulting from investments by or distributions to shareholders. Accumulated other comprehensive loss, as reflected on the Consolidated Statements of Equity, reflects the effective portion of the cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships.\nEarnings per Common Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding during the period. All outstanding unvested restricted share awards contain rights to non-forfeitable dividends and participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders and, accordingly, are considered participating securities that are included in the two-class method of computing basic earnings per share (“EPS”). Both the unvested restricted shares and other potentially dilutive common shares, and the related impact to earnings, are considered when calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis.\nThe Company's earnings per common share are determined as follows (dollars in thousands, except per share data):\nF-13\nAll options to purchase shares of common stock outstanding as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.\nExpensed Transaction, Development and Other Pursuit Costs\nThe Company capitalizes pre-development costs incurred in pursuit of new development opportunities for which the Company currently believes future development is probable (“Development Rights”). Future development of these Development Rights is dependent upon various factors, including zoning and regulatory approval, rental market conditions, construction costs and the availability of capital. Initial pre-development costs incurred for pursuits for which future development is not yet considered probable are expensed as incurred. In addition, if the status of a Development Right changes, making future development by the Company no longer probable, any non-recoverable capitalized pre-development costs are expensed. The Company expensed costs related to development pursuits not yet considered probable for development and the abandonment of Development Rights, as well as costs incurred in pursuing the acquisition or disposition of assets for which such acquisition and disposition activity did not occur, in the amounts of $\n2,192,000\n, $\n12,317,000\nand $\n4,896,000\nduring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These costs are included in expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The amount for 2020 includes the write-off of $\n7,264,000\nrelated to a Development Right in New York City that the Company deemed no longer probable. Abandoned pursuit costs can vary greatly, and the costs incurred in any given period may be significantly different in future periods.\nCasualty and Impairment of Long-Lived Assets\nIn the Company's evaluation of its real estate portfolio for impairment, as discussed below, it considered the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and did not identify any indicators of impairment as a result.\nThe Company evaluates its real estate and other long-lived assets for impairment when potential indicators of impairment exist. Such assets are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation and amortization, unless the carrying amount of the asset is not recoverable. If events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property or long-lived asset may not be recoverable, the Company assesses its recoverability by comparing the carrying amount of the property or long-lived asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows, the Company recognizes an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property or long-lived asset. Based on periodic tests of recoverability of long-lived assets, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did\nno\nt recognize any impairment losses other than those related to casualty losses from property damage. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a charge of $\n3,119,000\nfor the property and casualty damages across several communities in its East Coast markets related to severe storms as well as the property and casualty damages resulting from a fire at an operating community, reported as casualty and impairment loss on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe Company evaluates its for-sale condominium inventory for potential indicators of impairment, considering whether the fair value of the individual for-sale condominium units exceeds the carrying value of those units. For-sale condominium inventory is stated at cost, unless the carrying amount of the inventory is not recoverable when compared to the fair value of each unit. The Company determines the fair value of its for-sale condominium inventory as the estimated sales price less direct costs to sell. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did\nno\nt recognize any impairment losses on its for-sale condominium inventory.\nThe Company assesses its portfolio of land held for both development and investment for impairment if the intent of the Company changes with respect to either the development of, or the expected holding period for, the land. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company did\nno\nt recognize any impairment charges on its investment in land.\nThe Company evaluates its unconsolidated investments for other than temporary impairment, considering both the extent and amount by which the carrying value of the investment exceeds the fair value, and the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investment to recover its carrying value. The Company also evaluates its proportionate share of any impairment of assets held by unconsolidated investments. There were\nno\nother than temporary impairment losses recognized for any of the Company's investments in unconsolidated real estate entities during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nF-14\nAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations\nThe Company presents the assets and liabilities of any communities which have been sold, or otherwise qualify as held for sale, separately in the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. In addition, the results of operations for those assets that meet the definition of discontinued operations are presented as such in the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Real estate assets held for sale are measured at the lower of the carrying amount or the fair value less the cost to sell. Upon the classification of an asset as held for sale, no further depreciation is recorded. Disposals representing a strategic shift in operations (e.g., a disposal of a major geographic area, a major line of business or a major equity method investment) will be presented as discontinued operations, and for those assets qualifying for classification as discontinued operations, the specific components of net income presented as discontinued operations include net operating income, depreciation expense and interest expense, net. For periods prior to the asset qualifying for discontinued operations, the Company reclassifies the results of operations to discontinued operations. In addition, the net gain or loss (including any impairment loss) on the eventual disposal of assets held for sale will be presented as discontinued operations when recognized. A change in presentation for held for sale or discontinued operations has no impact on the Company's financial condition or results of operations. The Company combines the operating, investing and financing portions of cash flows attributable to discontinued operations with the respective cash flows from continuing operations on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. The Company had\none\nwholly-owned operating community that qualified as held for sale presentation at December 31, 2021.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements (collectively, \"Hedging Derivatives\") for interest rate risk management purposes and in conjunction with certain variable rate secured debt to satisfy lender requirements. The Company does not enter into Hedging Derivative transactions for trading or other speculative purposes. The Company assesses the effectiveness of qualifying cash flow and fair value hedges, both at inception and on an on-going basis. Hedge ineffectiveness is reported as a component of interest expense, net. The fair values of Hedging Derivatives that are in an asset position are recorded in prepaid expenses and other assets. The fair value of Hedging Derivatives that are in a liability position are included in accrued expenses and other liabilities. The Company does not present or disclose the fair value of Hedging Derivatives on a net basis. Fair value changes for derivatives that are not in qualifying hedge relationships are reported as a component of interest expense, net. For the Hedging Derivative positions that the Company has determined qualify as effective cash flow hedges, the Company has recorded the cumulative changes in the fair value of Hedging Derivatives in accumulated other comprehensive loss. Amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss will be reclassified into earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged cash flow. The effective portion of the change in fair value of the Hedging Derivatives that the Company has determined qualified as effective fair value hedges is reported as an adjustment to the carrying amount of the corresponding debt being hedged. See Note 11, “Fair Value,” for further discussion of derivative financial instruments.\nAcquisitions of Investments in Real Estate\nThe Company accounts for acquisitions of investments in real estate in accordance with the authoritative guidance for the initial measurement, which first requires that the Company determine if the real estate investment is the acquisition of an asset or a business combination. Under either model, the Company must identify and determine the fair value of any assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree. Typical assets acquired and liabilities assumed include land, building, furniture, fixtures and equipment, debt and identified intangible assets and liabilities, consisting of the value of above or below market leases and in-place leases. In making estimates of fair values for purposes of allocating purchase price, the Company utilizes various sources, including its own analysis of recently acquired and existing comparable properties in its portfolio and other market data. Consideration for acquisitions is typically in the form of cash unless otherwise disclosed. For a business combination, the Company records the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the fair value of each respective item. For an asset acquisition, the allocation of the purchase price is based on the relative fair value of the net assets. The Company expenses all applicable acquisition costs for a business combination and capitalizes all applicable acquisition costs for an asset acquisition. The Company expects that acquisitions of individual operating communities will generally be viewed as asset acquisitions.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions. These estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nF-15\nReclassifications\nCertain reclassifications have been made to amounts in prior years' notes to financial statements to conform to current year presentations as a result of changes in held for sale classification, disposition activity and segment classification.\nLeases\nThe Company is party to leases as both a lessor and a lessee, primarily as follows:\n•\nlessor of residential and commercial space within its apartment communities; and\n•\nlessee under (i) ground leases for land underlying current operating or development communities and certain commercial and parking facilities and (ii) office leases for its corporate headquarters and regional offices.\nLessee Considerations\nThe Company assesses whether a contract is or contains a lease based on whether the contract conveys the right to control the use of an identified asset, including specified portions of larger assets, for a period of time in exchange for consideration. The Company’s leases include both fixed and variable lease payments, which are based on an index or rate such as the consumer price index (CPI) or percentage rents based on total sales. Lease payments included in the lease liability include only fixed lease payments including fixed amounts that depend on an index or rate. For leases that have options to extend the term or terminate the lease early, the Company only factored the impact of such options into the lease term if the option was considered reasonably certain to be exercised. The Company determined the discount rate associated with its ground and office leases on a lease by lease basis using the Company’s actual borrowing rates as well as indicative market pricing for longer term rates and taking into consideration the remaining term of each of the lease agreements.\nLessor Considerations\nThe Company evaluates leases in which it is the lessor, which are composed of residential and commercial leases at its apartment communities, and determined these leases to be operating leases. For lease agreements that provide for rent concessions and/or scheduled fixed and determinable rent increases, rental income is recognized on a straight-line basis over the noncancellable term of the lease, which, for residential leases, is generally one year. Some of the Company’s commercial leases have fixed-price renewal options, and the lessee may be able to exercise its renewal option at an amount less than the fair value of the rent at such time. The Company only includes renewal options in the lease term if, at the commencement of the lease, it is reasonably certain that the lessee will exercise this option.\nAdditionally, for the Company’s residential and commercial leases, which are comprised of the lease component and common area maintenance as a non-lease component, the Company determined that (i) the leases are operating leases, (ii) the lease component is the predominant component and (iii) all components of its operating leases share the same timing and pattern of transfer.\nRevenue and Gain Recognition\nUnder ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, the Company recognizes revenue in accordance with the transfer of goods and services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration that the Company expects to be entitled to for those goods and services. The majority of the Company’s revenue is derived from residential and commercial rental income and other lease income, which are accounted for under ASC 842, Leases, as discussed above under \"Leases\". The Company's revenue streams that are not accounted for under ASC 842 include:\n•\nManagement fees - The Company has investment interests in real estate joint ventures, for which the Company may manage (i) the venture, (ii) the associated operating communities owned by the ventures and/or (iii) the development or redevelopment of those operating communities. For these activities, the Company receives asset management, property management, development and/or redevelopment fee revenue. The performance obligation is the management of the venture, community or other defined task such as the development or redevelopment of the community. While the individual activities that comprise the performance obligation of the management fees can vary day to day, the nature of the overall performance obligation to provide management service is the same and considered by the Company to be a series of services that have the same pattern of transfer to the customer and the same method to measure progress toward satisfaction of the performance obligation. The Company recognizes revenue for fees as earned on a monthly basis.\nF-16\n•\nRental and non-rental related income - The Company recognizes revenue for new rental related income not included as components of a lease, such as reservation and application fees, as well as for non-rental related income, as earned.\n•\nGains or losses on sales of real estate\n-\nThe Company accounts for the sale of real estate assets and any related gain recognition in accordance with the accounting guidance applicable to sales of real estate, which establishes standards for recognition of profit on all real estate sales transactions, other than commercial land sales. The Company recognizes the sale, and associated gain or loss from the disposition when the criteria for the sale of an asset have been met, which include when (i) a contract exists and (ii) the buyer obtained control of the nonfinancial asset that was sold. In addition, a gain or loss recognized on the sale of a nonfinancial asset to an unconsolidated entity is recognized at 100%, and not the Company’s proportionate ownership percentage.\nThe following table provides details of the Company’s revenue streams disaggregated by the Company’s reportable operating segments, further discussed in Note 8, “Segment Reporting,” for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The segments are classified based on the individual community's status at January 1, 2021 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and at January 1, 2020 for the year ended December 31, 2019. Segment information for total revenue has been adjusted to exclude the real estate assets that were sold from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of December 31, 2021, as described in Note 6, \"Real Estate Disposition Activities.\" (dollars in thousands):\n__________________________________\n(1)\nRevenue represents third-party management, asset management and developer fees and miscellaneous income and other ancillary items which are not allocated to a reportable segment.\nF-17\n(2)\nAmounts include revenue streams related to leasing activities that are not considered components of a lease, including but not limited to, apartment hold fees and application fees, as well as revenue streams not related to leasing activities, including but not limited to, vendor revenue sharing, building advertising, vending and dry cleaning revenue.\n(3)\nRepresents all revenue accounted for under ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers.\n(4)\nAmounts include all revenue streams derived from residential and commercial rental income and other lease income, which are accounted for under ASC 842.\nDue to the nature and timing of the Company’s identified revenue streams, there are no material amounts of outstanding or unsatisfied performance obligations as of December 31, 2021.\nUncollectible Lease Revenue Reserves\nThe Company assesses the collectability of its lease revenue and receivables on an on-going basis. Under ASC 842, Leases, the Company assesses the probability of receiving all remaining lease amounts due on a lease by lease basis, reserving for revenue and the related receivables for those leases where collection of substantially all of the remaining lease payments is not probable. Subsequently, the Company will only recognize revenue to the extent cash is received. If the Company determines that collection of the remaining lease payments becomes probable at a future date, the Company will recognize the cumulative revenue that would have been recorded under the original lease agreement.\nIn addition to the specific reserves recognized under ASC 842, the Company also evaluates its lease receivables for collectability at a portfolio level under ASC 450, Contingencies – Loss Contingencies. The Company recognizes a reserve under ASC 450 when the uncollectible revenue is probable and reasonably estimable. The Company applies this reserve to the population of the Company’s revenue and receivables not specifically addressed as part of the specific ASC 842 reserve.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization designated COVID-19 as a pandemic. While the Company has taken various actions in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the ultimate impact on its consolidated results of operations, cash flows, financial condition and liquidity will depend on, among other factors, (i) the effect on the multifamily industry and the general economy of measures taken by businesses and the government in response to the novel coronavirus and relieve economic distress of consumers, such as governmental limitations on the ability of multifamily owners to evict residents who are delinquent in the payment of their rent and (ii) the preferences of consumers and businesses for living and working arrangements both during and after the pandemic.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company assessed the collectibility of the outstanding lease income receivables as a result of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its residential and commercial lease portfolios. The Company recorded an aggregate offset to income for uncollectible lease revenue for its residential and commercial portfolios of $\n52,075,000\nand $\n66,763,000\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 under ASC 842 and ASC 450, Contingencies.\nF-18\n2.\nInterest Capitalized\nThe Company capitalizes interest during the development and redevelopment of real estate assets. Capitalized interest associated with the Company's development or redevelopment activities totaled $\n32,687,000\n, $\n44,157,000\nand $\n62,823,000\nfor years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n3.\nMortgage Notes Payable, Unsecured Notes, Term Loans and Credit Facility\nThe Company's mortgage notes payable, unsecured notes, variable rate unsecured term loans (the “Term Loans”) and Credit Facility, as defined below, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized below.\nThe following amounts and discussion do not include the mortgage notes related to the communities classified as held for sale, if any, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, as shown in the Consolidated Balance Sheets (dollars in thousands) (see Note 6, “Real Estate Disposition Activities”).\n_________________________________\n(1)     Balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020 exclude $\n10,033\nand $\n10,380\n, respectively, of debt discount, and $\n40,573\nand $\n37,615\n, respectively, of deferred financing costs, as reflected in unsecured notes, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)     Balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020 exclude $\n13,528\nand $\n14,478\nof debt discount, respectively, and $\n2,750\nand $\n3,004\n, respectively, of deferred financing costs, as reflected in mortgage notes payable, net on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following debt activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n•\nIn January 2021, the Company repaid $\n27,795,000\nprincipal amount of\n5.37\n% fixed rate secured debt at par in advance of its April 2021 maturity date.\n•\nIn September 2021, the Company repaid $\n450,000,000\nprincipal amount of its\n2.95\n% unsecured notes in advance of the September 2022 scheduled maturity, recognizing a loss on debt extinguishment of $\n17,890,000\n, composed of a prepayment penalty of $\n12,147,000\n, and the non-cash write off of unamortized deferred hedging losses and unamortized deferred financing costs of $\n5,743,000\n.\n•\nIn September 2021, the Company issued $\n700,000,000\nprincipal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under its existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately $\n694,617,000\n, before considering the impact of other offering costs. The notes mature in January 2032 and were issued at a\n2.05\n% interest rate. The notes were issued under the Company's green bond framework, and the Company has allocated or will allocate the net proceeds, in whole or in part, to one or more new or existing eligible green projects.\n•\nIn November 2021, the Company repaid an aggregate of $\n73,060,000\nprincipal amount of fixed rate secured debt with a weighted average interest rate of\n3.79\n% at par in advance of the November 2036 maturity date.\n•\nIn November 2021, the Company issued $\n400,000,000\nprincipal amount of unsecured notes in a public offering under its existing shelf registration statement for proceeds net of underwriting fees of approximately $\n396,976,000\n, before considering the impact of other offering costs. The notes mature in December 2028 and were issued at a\n1.90\n% interest rate. The notes were issued under the Company's green bond framework, and the Company has allocated or will allocate the net proceeds, in whole or in part, to one or more new or existing eligible green projects.\nF-19\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had a $\n1,750,000,000\nrevolving variable rate unsecured credit facility with a syndicate of banks (the “Credit Facility”) which matures in February 2024. The Credit Facility bears interest at varying levels based on (i) the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) applicable to the period of borrowing for a particular draw of funds from the facility (e.g., one month to maturity, three months to maturity, etc.) and (ii) the rating levels issued for our unsecured notes. The current stated pricing for drawn borrowings is LIBOR plus\n0.775\n% per annum (\n0.88\n% at December 31, 2021), assuming a one month borrowing rate. The annual facility fee for the Credit Facility remained at\n0.125\n%, resulting in a fee of $\n2,188,000\nannually based on the $\n1,750,000,000\nfacility size and based on the Company's current credit rating.\nThe Company had\nno\nborrowings outstanding under the Credit Facility and had $\n11,969,000\nand $\n2,900,000\noutstanding in letters of credit that reduced the borrowing capacity as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. In addition, the Company had $\n39,581,000\nand $\n32,079,000\noutstanding in additional letters of credit unrelated to the Credit Facility as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIn the aggregate, secured notes payable mature at various dates from March 2027 through July 2066, and are secured by certain apartment communities (with a net carrying value of $\n1,256,155,000\n, excluding communities classified as held for sale, as of December 31, 2021).\nThe weighted average interest rate of the Company's fixed rate secured notes payable (conventional and tax-exempt) was\n3.7\n% and\n3.8\n% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The weighted average interest rate of the Company's variable rate secured notes payable (conventional and tax exempt) including the effect of certain financing related fees, was\n1.7\n% at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nScheduled payments and maturities of secured notes payable and unsecured notes outstanding at December 31, 2021 are as follows (dollars in thousands):\nF-20\nThe Company's unsecured notes are redeemable at the Company's option, in whole or in part, generally at a redemption price equal to the greater of (i)\n100\n% of their principal amount or (ii) the sum of the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest discounted at a rate equal to the yield on U.S. Treasury securities with a comparable maturity plus a spread between\n20\nand\n45\nbasis points depending on the specific series of unsecured notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date.\nThe Company is subject to financial covenants contained in the Credit Facility, the Term Loans and the indentures under which the unsecured notes were issued. The principal financial covenants include the following:\n•\nlimitations on the amount of total and secured debt in relation to our overall capital structure;\n•\nlimitations on the amount of our unsecured debt relative to the undepreciated basis of real estate assets that are not encumbered by property-specific financing; and\n•\nminimum levels of debt service coverage.\nThe Company was in compliance at December 31, 2021 with customary covenants under the Credit Facility, the Term Loans and the Company's fixed rate unsecured notes.\n4.\nEquity\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's charter had authorized for issuance a total of\n280,000,000\nshares of common stock and\n50,000,000\nshares of preferred stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company:\ni.\nissued\n2,759\nshares of common stock in connection with stock options exercised;\nii.\nissued\n2,844\nshares of common stock through the Company's dividend reinvestment plan;\niii.\nissued\n155,836\nshares of common stock in connection with restricted stock grants and the conversion of performance awards to shares of common stock;\niv.\nsold\n122,343\nshares of common stock under CEP V, as discussed below;\nv.\nwithheld\n75,780\nshares of common stock to satisfy employees' tax withholding and other liabilities;\nvi.\nissued\n21,362\nshares of common stock through the Employee Stock Purchase Plan; and\nvii.\ncanceled\n4,109\nshares of restricted common stock upon forfeiture.\nAny deferred compensation related to the Company’s stock based compensation plans during the year ended December 31, 2021 is not reflected on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2021, and will not be reflected until recognized as compensation cost.\nIn July 2020, the Company’s Board of Directors approved a new stock repurchase program under which the Company may acquire shares of its common stock in open market or negotiated transactions up to an aggregate purchase price of $\n500,000,000\n(the \"2020 Stock Repurchase Program\"). Purchases of common stock under the 2020 Stock Repurchase Program may be exercised at the Company’s discretion with the timing and number of shares repurchased depending on a variety of factors including price, corporate and regulatory requirements, market conditions and other corporate liquidity requirements and priorities. The 2020 Stock Repurchase Program does not have an expiration date and may be suspended or terminated at any time without prior notice. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company had\nno\nrepurchases of shares under this program. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n316,148,000\nremaining authorized for purchase under this program.\nF-21\nIn May 2019, the Company commenced a fifth continuous equity program (\"CEP V\") under which the Company may sell (and/or enter into forward sale agreements for the sale of) up to $\n1,000,000,000\nof its common stock from time to time. Actual sales will depend on a variety of factors to be determined by the Company, including market conditions, the trading price of the Company's common stock and the Company's determinations of the appropriate funding sources. The Company engaged sales agents for CEP V who receive compensation of up to\n1.5\n% of the gross sales price for shares sold. The Company expects that, if entered into, it will physically settle each forward sale agreement on one or more dates specified by the Company on or prior to the maturity date of that particular forward sale agreement, and to receive aggregate net cash proceeds at settlement equal to the number of shares underlying the particular forward agreement multiplied by the forward sale price. However, the Company may also elect to cash settle or net share settle a forward sale agreement. In connection with each forward sale agreement, the Company will pay the forward seller, in the form of a reduced initial forward sale price, a commission of up to\n1.5\n% of the sales prices of all borrowed shares of common stock sold. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company sold\n122,343\nshares of common stock at an average sales price of $\n226.15\nper share, for net proceeds of $\n27,253,000\nunder this program. In addition, at December 31, 2021, the Company was party to a forward contract under CEP V to sell\n68,577\nshares of common stock for approximate proceeds of $\n16,000,000\nnet of offering fees and discounts based on the initial forward price, with settlement of the forward contract to occur on one or more dates not later than December 31, 2022. The final proceeds will be determined on the date(s) of settlement after adjustments for the Company's dividends and a daily interest factor. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n705,961,000\nremaining authorized for issuance under CEP V, after consideration of the forward contract.\n5.\nInvestments\nUnconsolidated Investments\nThe Company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated entities under the equity method of accounting or under the measurement alternative, as discussed in Note 1, “Organization, Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” under\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n. The significant accounting policies of the Company's unconsolidated investments are consistent with those of the Company in all material respects. Certain of these investments are subject to various buy‑sell provisions or other rights which are customary in real estate joint venture agreements. The Company and its partners in these entities may initiate these provisions to either sell the Company's interest or acquire the joint venture interest from the Company's partner.\nThe following presents the Company's activities in unconsolidated investments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nArchstone Multifamily Partners AC LP (the “U.S. Fund”)\n—The Company is the general partner of the U.S. Fund and has a\n28.6\n% combined general partner and limited partner equity interest. The Company acquired its interest in the U.S. Fund as part of the Archstone Acquisition (as defined in Note 5, “Investments in Real Estate Entities,” of the Consolidated Financial Statements in Item 8 in the Company's Form 10-K filed February 22, 2019). The U.S. Fund sold\none\ncommunity in each of 2020 and 2019, and the Company's proportionate share of the gains in accordance with GAAP was $\n5,157,000\nand $\n5,788,000\n, respectively.

Annually as of January 1, the Company determines which of its communities fall into each of these categories and generally maintains that classification throughout the year for the purpose of reporting segment operations, unless disposition or redevelopment plans regarding a community change.\n•\nSame Store\nis composed of\nconsolidated communities where a comparison of operating results from the prior year to the current year is meaningful as these communities were owned and had stabilized occupancy as of the beginning of the respective prior year. For the year ended December 31, 2021, Same Store communities are consolidated for financial reporting purposes, had stabilized occupancy as of January 1, 2020, are not conducting or are not probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities and are not held for sale as of December 31, 2021 or probable for disposition to unrelated third parties within the fiscal year. A community is considered to have stabilized occupancy at the earlier of (i) attainment of\n90\n% physical occupancy or (ii) the\none year\nanniversary of completion of development or redevelopment.\n•\nOther Stabilized\nis composed of completed consolidated communities that the Company owns and that are not Same Store but which have stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as of January 1, 2021, or which were acquired during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020. Other Stabilized includes stabilized operating communities in Charlotte, North Carolina and Dallas, Texas, the two new expansion markets the Company entered in 2021, but excludes communities that are conducting or are probable to conduct substantial redevelopment activities within the fiscal year.\n•\nDevelopment/Redevelopment\nis composed of (i) consolidated communities that are either currently under construction, or were under construction during the fiscal year, which may be partially or fully complete and operating, (ii) consolidated communities where substantial redevelopment is in progress or is probable to begin during the fiscal year and (iii) communities under lease-up that have been complete for less than one year and have not reached stabilized occupancy, as defined above, as of January 1, 2021.\nIn addition, the Company owns land for future development and has other corporate assets that are not allocated to an operating segment.\nThe Company's segment disclosures present the measure(s) used by the chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") for purposes of assessing each segment's performance. The Company's CODM is comprised of several members of its executive management team who use net operating income (“NOI”) as the primary financial measure for Same Store communities and Other Stabilized communities. NOI is defined by the Company as total property revenue less direct property operating expenses (including property taxes), and excluding corporate-level income (including management, development and other fees), corporate-level property management and other indirect operating expenses, expensed transaction, development and other pursuit costs, net of recoveries, interest expense, loss on extinguishment of debt, net, general and administrative expense, income from investments in unconsolidated entities, depreciation expense, income tax expense (benefit), casualty and impairment loss, gain on sale of communities, gain on other real estate transactions, net, net for-sale condominium activity and net operating income from real estate assets sold or held for sale. The CODM evaluates the Company's financial performance on a consolidated residential and commercial basis. The Company's commercial results attributable to the non-apartment components of the Company's mixed-use communities and other nonresidential operations represent\n1.7\n%,\n0.8\n% and\n1.8\n% of total NOI for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Although the Company considers NOI a useful measure of a community's or communities' operating performance, NOI should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flow from operating activities, as determined in accordance with GAAP. NOI excludes a number of income and expense categories as detailed in the reconciliation of NOI to net income.\nF-28\nA reconciliation of NOI to net income for years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (dollars in thousands):\nThe following is a summary of NOI from real estate assets sold or held for sale for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nThe primary performance measure for communities under development or redevelopment depends on the stage of completion. While under development, management monitors actual construction costs against budgeted costs as well as lease-up pace and rent levels compared to budget.\nThe following table provides details of the Company's segment information as of the dates specified (dollars in thousands). The segments are classified based on the individual community's status at January 1, 2021 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and at January 1, 2020, for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nSegment information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 has been adjusted to exclude the real estate assets that were sold from January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2021, or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of December 31, 2021, as described in Note 6, “Real Estate Disposition Activities.”\nF-29\n_________________________________\n(1)     Does not include gross real estate assets held for sale of $\n26,176\nas of December 31, 2021 and gross real estate assets either sold or classified as held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2020 and 2019 of $\n474,792\nand $\n871,291\n, respectively.\n(2)     Gross real estate for the Company's Same Store includes capitalized additions of approximately $\n158,991\n, $\n126,548\nand $\n128,324\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nF-30\n(3)     Revenue represents third-party management, accounting, and developer fees and miscellaneous income and other ancillary items which are not allocated to a reportable segment. Gross real estate includes the for-sale residential condominiums at The Park Loggia, as discussed in Note 6, \"Real Estate Disposition Activities.\"\n9.\nStock-Based Compensation Plans\nThe Company's Second Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2009 Plan”) includes an authorization to issue shares of the Company's common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share. At December 31, 2021, the Company had\n6,088,456\nshares remaining available to issue under the 2009 Plan, exclusive of shares that may be issued to satisfy currently outstanding awards such as stock options or performance awards. The 2009 Plan provides for various types of equity awards to associates, officers, non-employee directors and other key personnel of the Company and its subsidiaries. The types of awards that may be granted under the 2009 Plan include restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock options that qualify as incentive stock options (“ISOs”) under Section 422 of the Code, non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights and performance awards, among others. No grants of stock options and other awards will be made after May 15, 2027, and no grants of incentive stock options will be made after February 16, 2027.\nInformation with respect to stock options granted under the 2009 Plan is as follows:\n__________________________________\n(1)\nIncludes\n4,847\noptions resulting from recipient elections to receive a portion of earned restricted stock awards in the form of stock options.\nIn February 2021, as a supplement to its normal compensation framework for officers, the Company granted stock options with the exercise price equal to the closing stock price on the date of grant. The stock options awarded in 2021 have a\nten-year\nterm and will cliff vest on March 1, 2023. For these supplemental 2021 stock options, the officer will have 12 months to exercise the option if terminated without cause and will have until the expiration date to exercise the options if the officer retires after the cliff vesting date. The Company used the Black-Scholes Option Pricing model to determine the grant date fair value of options.\nThe assumptions used are as follows:\nF-31\nThe following summarizes the exercise prices and contractual lives of options outstanding as of December 31, 2021:\nOptions outstanding and exercisable at December 31, 2021 had an intrinsic value of $\n22,102,000\nand $\n1,187,000\n, respectively. Options exercisable had a weighted average contractual life of\n0.9\nyears. The intrinsic value of options exercised under the 2009 Plan during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n186,000\n, $\n251,000\nand $\n7,970,000\n, respectively. There were\nno\nstock options granted in 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company has a compensation framework under which share-based compensation granted is composed of annual restricted stock awards for which one third of the award vests annually over a three-year period, and multi-year long term incentive performance awards. For annual restricted stock awards, in lieu of time-vesting restricted stock, the recipient may elect to receive up to\n100\n% of the award value, in increments of\n25\n%, in the form of stock options, for which one third of the award vests annually over a\nthree-year\nperiod. Under the Company's multi-year long term incentive compensation framework, the Company grants a target number of performance awards, with the ultimate award determined by the total shareholder return of the Company's common stock and/or operating performance metrics, measured in each case over a measurement period of up to\nthree years\n. Performance units granted in 2017 or earlier that were earned at the end of the measurement period were settled in the form of time-vesting restricted stock. Performance units granted in 2018 and later years that are earned at the end of the measurement period are settled in fully vested shares of common stock and an amount of cash equal to the dividends that would have been payable, while the performance award was outstanding, on a number of shares equal to the number of units earned.\nAfter the first year of the performance period, if the employee's employment terminates on account of death, disability, retirement, or termination without cause, the employee shall vest in a pro rata portion of the award (based on the employee's service time during the performance period), with such vested portion to be earned and converted into shares and the cash amount for the dividends described above at the end of the performance period based on actual achievement under the performance award. For other terminating events, performance awards are generally forfeited.\nInformation with respect to performance awards granted is as follows:\nF-32\n_________________________________\n(1)     The shares of common stock earned was based on the total shareholder return metrics for the Company’s common stock for\n47,502\nperformance awards and financial metrics related to operating performance, net asset value and leverage metrics of the Company for\n33,010\nperformance awards.\n(2)    Represents the change in the number of performance awards earned based on performance achievement.\n(3)    The shares of common stock that may be earned is based on the total shareholder return metrics for the Company’s common stock for\n38,823\nperformance awards and financial metrics related to operating performance and leverage metrics of the Company for\n38,359\nperformance awards.\n(4)    The shares of common stock that may be earned is based on the total shareholder return metrics for the Company’s common stock for\n69,064\nperformance awards and financial metrics related to operating performance and leverage metrics of the Company for\n68,969\nperformance awards.\nThe Company used a Monte Carlo model to assess the compensation cost associated with the portion of the performance awards granted for which achievement will be determined by using total shareholder return measures.\nThe assumptions used are as follows:\n_________________________________\n(1)     Estimated volatility over the life of the plan is using\n50\n% historical volatility and\n50\n% implied volatility.\nFor the portion of the performance awards granted for which achievement will be determined by using financial metrics, the compensation cost was based on a weighted average grant date value of $\n178.38\n, $\n224.64\nand $\n195.86\n, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and the Company's estimate of corporate achievement for the financial metrics.\nInformation with respect to restricted stock granted is as follows:\nF-33\nTotal employee stock-based compensation cost recognized in income was $\n25,100,000\n, $\n21,110,000\nand $\n24,885,000\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and total capitalized stock-based compensation cost was $\n9,472,000\n, $\n9,974,000\nand $\n9,396,000\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. At December 31, 2021, there was a total unrecognized compensation cost of $\n39,440,000\nfor unvested restricted stock, stock options and performance awards, which does not include forfeitures, and is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n1.7\nyears. Forfeitures are included in compensation cost as they occur.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nIn October 1996, the Company adopted the 1996 Non-Qualified Employee Stock Purchase Plan (as amended, the “ESPP”). Initially\n1,000,000\nshares of common stock were reserved for issuance under this plan. There are currently\n612,912\nshares remaining available for issuance under the ESPP. Employees of the Company generally are eligible to participate in the ESPP if, as of the last day of the applicable purchase period, they have been employed by the Company for at least\none month\n. Under the ESPP, eligible employees are permitted to acquire shares of the Company's common stock through payroll deductions, subject to maximum purchase limitations, during\ntwo\npurchase periods. The first purchase period begins January 1 and ends June 10, and the second purchase period begins July 1 and ends December 10. The purchase price for common stock purchased under the plan is\n85\n% of the lesser of the fair market value of the Company's common stock on the first day of the applicable purchase period or the last day of the applicable purchase period. The offering dates, purchase dates and duration of purchase periods may be changed if the change is announced prior to the beginning of the affected date or purchase period. The Company issued\n21,362\n,\n20,161\nand\n13,894\nshares and recognized compensation expense of $\n1,609,000\n, $\n537,000\nand $\n761,000\nunder the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company accounts for transactions under the ESPP using the fair value method prescribed by accounting guidance applicable to entities that use employee share purchase plans.\n10.\nRelated Party Arrangements\nUnconsolidated Entities\nThe Company manages unconsolidated real estate entities for which it receives asset management, property management, development and redevelopment fee revenue. From these entities, the Company earned fees of $\n3,084,000\n, $\n3,819,000\nand $\n4,960,000\nin the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In addition, the Company had outstanding receivables associated with its property and construction management roles of $\n3,964,000\nand $\n5,408,000\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDirector Compensation\nDirectors of the Company who are also employees receive no additional compensation for their services as a director. Following each annual meeting of stockholders, non-employee directors receive (i) a number of shares of restricted stock (or deferred stock units) having a value of $\n170,000\nand (ii) a cash payment of $\n90,000\n, payable in equal quarterly installments of\nF-34\n$\n22,500\n. The number of shares of restricted stock (or deferred stock units) is calculated based on the closing price on the day of the award. Non-employee directors may elect to receive all or a portion of cash payments in the form of deferred stock units. Additionally, the Lead Independent Director receives in the aggregate an additional annual fee of $\n30,000\npayable in equal quarterly installments of $\n7,500\n, the non-employee director serving as the chairperson of the Audit Committee receives additional cash compensation of $\n25,000\nper year payable in equal quarterly installments of $\n6,250\n, the non-employee director serving as the chairperson of the Compensation Committee receives additional cash compensation of $\n20,000\nper year payable in equal quarterly installments of $\n5,000\nand the Nominating and Corporate Governance and Investment and Finance Committee chairpersons receive an additional annual fee of $\n15,000\npayable in equal quarterly installments of $\n3,750\n.\nThe Company recorded non-employee director compensation expense relating to restricted stock grants and deferred stock units in the amount of $\n1,981,000\n, $\n1,819,000\nand $\n1,725,000\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, as a component of general and administrative expense. Deferred compensation relating to these restricted stock grants and deferred stock units to non-employee directors was $\n696,000\n, $\n614,000\nand $\n594,000\non December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, reported as a component of prepaid expenses and other assets on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n11.\nFair Value\nFinancial Instruments Carried at Fair Value\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe Company uses interest rate swap and interest rate cap agreements to manage its interest rate risk. These instruments are carried at fair value in the Company's financial statements. In adjusting the fair value of its derivative contracts for the effect of counterparty nonperformance risk, the Company has considered the impact of its net position with a given counterparty, as well as any applicable credit enhancements, such as collateral postings, thresholds, mutual puts and guarantees. The Company minimizes its credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major, creditworthy financial institutions which have an A or better credit rating by the Standard & Poor's Ratings Group. As part of its on-going control procedures, the Company monitors the credit ratings of counterparties and the exposure of the Company to any single entity, thus reducing credit risk concentration. The Company believes the likelihood of realizing losses from counterparty nonperformance is remote. Although the Company has determined that the majority of the inputs used to value its derivatives fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, such as interest rate, term to maturity and volatility, the credit valuation adjustments associated with its derivatives use Level 3 inputs, such as estimates of current credit spreads, to evaluate the likelihood of default by itself and its counterparties. As of December 31, 2021, the Company assessed the significance of the impact of the credit valuation adjustments on the overall valuation of its derivative positions and has determined it is not significant. As a result, the Company has determined that its derivative valuations are classified in Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table summarizes the consolidated derivative positions at December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n_________________________________\n(1)     For debt hedged by interest rate caps, represents the weighted average interest rate on the hedged debt prior to any impact of the associated interest rate caps.\nThe following derivative activity occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n•\nThe Company terminated $\n150,000,000\nof forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020, receiving a payment of $\n6,962,000\n. The Company recognized $\n2,894,000\nof these proceeds as a gain in 2020, and $\n2,654,000\nof these proceeds as a gain during the year ended December 31, 2021 included in interest expense, net on the accompanying Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nF-35\n•\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the Company's $\n700,000,000\n2.050\n% unsecured notes due 2032 in September 2021, the Company settled $\n200,000,000\nof forward interest rate swap agreements, entered into in 2021, designated as cash flow hedges of the interest rate variability on the issuance of the unsecured notes, making a net payment of $\n2,211,000\n. The Company has deferred these amounts in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets, and is recognizing the impact as a component of interest expense, net, over the term of the respective hedged debt.\n•\nThe Company entered into an additional $\n150,000,000\nof new forward interest rate swap agreements executed to reduce the impact of variability in interest rates on a portion of the Company's expected debt issuance activity in 2022.\nAt the maturity of the remaining outstanding swap agreements, the Company expects to cash settle the contracts and either pay or receive cash for the then current fair value. Assuming that the Company issues the debt as expected, the hedging impact from these positions will then be recognized over the life of the issued debt as a yield adjustment.\nThe Company had\nfive\nderivatives not designated as hedges at December 31, 2021. Other than the $\n150,000,000\nof forward interest rate swap agreements for which hedge accounting was ceased in 2020, fair value changes for derivatives not in qualifying hedge relationships for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not material. During 2021, the Company deferred $\n993,000\nof net gains for cash flow hedges reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss.\nThe following table summarizes the deferred losses reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings (dollars in thousands):\nThe Company anticipates reclassifying approximately $\n4,051,000\nof net hedging losses from accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings within the next 12 months as an offset to the hedged item during this period. The Company did\nno\nt have any derivatives designated as fair value hedges as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nThe Company issued units of limited partnership interest in a DownREIT that provides the DownREIT limited partners the ability to present all or some of their units for redemption for cash as determined by the partnership agreement. Under the DownREIT agreement, for each limited partnership unit, the limited partner is entitled to receive cash in the amount equal to the fair value of the Company's common stock on or about the date of redemption. In lieu of cash redemption, the Company may elect to exchange such units for an equal number of shares of the Company's common stock. The limited partnership units in the DownREIT are valued using the market price of the Company's common stock, a Level 1 price under the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial Instruments Not Carried at Fair Value\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalent balances are held with various financial institutions within accounts designed to preserve principal. The Company monitors credit ratings of these financial institutions and the concentration of cash and cash equivalent balances with any one financial institution and believes the likelihood of realizing material losses related to cash and cash equivalent balances is remote. Cash and cash equivalents are carried at their face amounts, which reasonably approximate their fair values and are Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy.\nOther Financial Instruments\nRents and other receivables and prepaid expenses, accounts and construction payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities are carried at their face amounts, which reasonably approximate their fair values based on their short-term maturities.\nF-36\nIndebtedness\nThe Company values its fixed rate unsecured notes using quoted market prices, a Level 1 price within the fair value hierarchy. The Company values its mortgage notes payable, variable rate unsecured notes, including the Term Loans, and outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility using a discounted cash flow analysis on the expected cash flows of each instrument. This analysis reflects the contractual terms of the instrument, including the period to maturity, and uses observable market-based inputs, including interest rate curves. The process also considers credit valuation adjustments to appropriately reflect the Company's nonperformance risk. The Company has concluded that the value of its mortgage notes payable, variable rate unsecured notes, Term Loans and outstanding amounts under the Credit Facility are Level 2 prices as the majority of the inputs used to value its positions fall within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.\nFinancial Instruments Measured/Disclosed at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe following tables summarize the classification between the three levels of the fair value hierarchy of the Company's financial instruments measured/disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis (dollars in thousands):\nF-37\n12.\nSubsequent Events\nThe Company has evaluated subsequent events, through the date on which this Form 10-K was filed, the date on which these financial statements were issued, and identified the items below for discussion.\nIn January 2022, the Company entered into agreements to sell\ntwo\nwholly-owned operating communities containing an aggregate of\n408\napartment homes and net real estate of $\n64,984,000\nas of December 31, 2021, resulting in the communities qualifying as held for sale subsequent to December 31, 2021. In February 2022, the Company sold\none\nof these communities, Avalon Ossining, located in Ossining, NY, containing\n168\napartment homes for $\n70,000,000\n. The Company expects to complete the sale of the other community in the first quarter of 2022.\nIn February 2022, the Company sold Avalon West Long Branch, located in West Long Branch, NJ, containing\n180\napartment homes for $\n75,000,000\n.
