    "text": "General\nWelltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower\n™\n, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of seniors housing, post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties. More information is available on the Internet at www.welltower.com. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.\nOur primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in net operating income and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.\nReferences herein to “we,” “us,” “our” or the “company” refer to Welltower Inc., a Delaware corporation, and its subsidiaries unless specifically noted otherwise.\nPortfolio of Properties\nPlease see “Item 7 – Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operation – Executive Summary – Company Overview” for a table that summarizes our portfolio as of December 31, 2021.\nProperty Types\nWe invest in seniors housing and health care real estate and evaluate our business through three reportable segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. For additional information regarding our segments, please see Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements. The following is a summary of our various property types.\nSeniors Housing Operating\nOur Seniors Housing Operating properties include seniors apartments, independent living and independent supportive living, continuing care retirement communities, assisted living, Alzheimer's/dementia care and include care homes with or without nursing (U.K.), which assist with activities of daily living that preserve a person's mobility and social systems to promote cognitive engagement. Our properties include stand-alone properties that provide one level of service, combination properties that provide multiple levels of service and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services. Properties are primarily held in joint venture entities with operating partners. We utilize the structure authorized by the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007, which is commonly referred to as a “RIDEA” structure (the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code authorizing the RIDEA structure were enacted as part of the Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008).\nSeniors Apartments\nSeniors apartments generally refer to age-restricted multi-unit housing with self-contained living units for older adults, usually aged 55+ who are able to care for themselves. Seniors apartments generally do not offer other additional services such as meals.\nIndependent Living and Independent Supportive Living (Canada)\nIndependent living and independent supportive living generally refers to age-restricted, multifamily properties with central dining that provide residents access to meals and other services such as housekeeping, linen service, transportation and social and recreational activities.\nContinuing Care Retirement Communities\nContinuing care retirement communities typically include a combination of detached homes and properties offering independent living, assisted living and/or long-term/post-acute care services on one campus. These communities appeal to residents because there is no need to relocate when health and medical needs change. Resident payment plans vary, but can include entrance fees, condominium fees and rental fees. Many of these communities also charge monthly maintenance fees in exchange for a living unit, meals and some health services.\nAssisted Living\nAssisted living refers to state-regulated rental properties that provide independent living services, but also provide supportive care from trained employees to residents who require assistance with activities of daily living, including, but not limited to, management of medications, bathing, dressing, toileting, ambulating and eating.\nAlzheimer’s/Dementia Care\nAlzheimer's/Dementia Care refers to state-regulated rental properties that generally provide assisted living and independent living services, but also provide supportive care to residents with memory loss, Alzheimer's disease and/or other types of dementia. Amenities vary, but may include enhanced security, specialized design features and memory-enhancing therapies that promote relaxation and help slow cognitive decline.\n2\nCare Homes with or without Nursing (U.K.)\nCare homes without nursing, regulated by the Care Quality Commission (\"CQC”), are rental properties that provide essentially the same services as U.S. assisted living. Care homes with nursing, also regulated by the CQC, are licensed daily rate or rental properties where most individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for various national and local reimbursement programs. Unlike the U.S., care homes with nursing in the U.K. generally do not provide post-acute care.\nOur Seniors Housing Operating segment accounted for 68%, 67% and 67% of total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, we had relationships wit\nh\n38 operators to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties. In each instance, our partner provides management services to the properties pursuant to an incentive-based management contract. We rely on our partners to effectively and efficiently manage these properties. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our relationship with Sunrise Senior Living accounted for approximately 33% of our Seniors Housing Operating segment revenues and 22% of our total revenues. Additionally Revera accounted for approximately 11% of our Seniors Housing Operating segment revenues and 7% our total revenues. Revera owns a controlling interest in Sunrise Senior Living.\nTriple-net\nOur Triple-net properties offer services including independent living and independent supportive living (Canada), assisted living, continuing care retirement communities, Alzheimer's/dementia care and care homes with or without nursing (U.K.) described above, as well as long-term/post-acute care. Our properties include stand-alone properties that provide one level of service, combination facilities that provide multiple levels of service, and communities or campuses that provide a wide range of services. We invest primarily through acquisitions, development and joint venture partnerships. Our properties are primarily leased to operators under long-term, triple-net master leases that obligate the tenant to pay all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, building repairs, maintenance costs and all obligations under certain ground leases. We are not involved in property management.\nLong-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities\nPost-acute care is at the leading edge of reducing health care costs while improving quality. These high-impact centers help patients recover from illness or surgery with the goals of getting the patient home and healed faster and reducing hospital readmission rates. Our long-term/post-acute care properties generally offer skilled nursing/post-acute care, inpatient rehabilitation and long-term acute care services. Skilled nursing/post-acute care refers to licensed daily rate or rental properties where most individuals require 24-hour nursing and/or medical care. Generally, these properties are licensed for Medicaid and/or Medicare reimbursement in the U.S. or provincial reimbursement in Canada. All properties offer some level of rehabilitation services. Some properties focus on higher acuity patients and offer rehabilitation units specializing in cardiac, orthopedic, dialysis, neurological or pulmonary rehabilitation. Inpatient rehabilitation properties provide intensive inpatient services after illness, injury or surgery to patients able to tolerate and benefit from three hours of rehabilitation per day. Long-term acute care properties provide inpatient services for patients with complex medical conditions that require more intensive care, monitoring or emergency support than is available in most skilled nursing/post-acute care properties.\nOur Triple-net segment accounted for 19%, 17% a\nnd\n19%\nof total revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues related to our relationship with ProMedica Health System (\"ProMedica\") accounted for approximately 26% of our Triple-net segment revenues and 5% of total revenues. As of December 31, 2021, our relationship with ProMedica was comprised of a master lease for 205 properties owned by a joint venture landlord of which we own 80%. In addition to rent, the master lease requires ProMedica to pay all operating costs, utilities, real estate taxes, insurance, building repairs, maintenance costs and all obligations under certain ground leases. All obligations under the master lease have been guaranteed by ProMedica.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, our revenues related to our relationship with Genesis Healthcare (\"Genesis\") accounted for approximately 6% of our Triple-net segment revenues and 1% of our total revenues. During 2020, Genesis indicated substantial doubt as to their ability to continue as a going concern. As a result, effective July 1, 2020, we recognized reserves for all existing straight-line rent receivable balances of $91,025,000 as a reduction to rental income and now recognize rental income from Genesis on a cash basis. Additionally, in March 2021, we entered into definitive agreements to substantially exit our operating relationship with Genesis. As of December 31, 2021, we have transitioned nine facilities to an 80/20 joint venture with ProMedica. Additionally, operations have transitioned to new operators for 39 of the remaining 42 properties, with three properties expected to transition at a later date. We have entered into definitive agreements to sell the 42 properties to either a joint venture with Aurora Health Network, the new operator and us, or to sell outright. As of December 31, 2021, we have closed on the sale of 25 of those properties. An additional ten properties are classified as held for sale and the remaining seven properties are expected to be sold in 2023. As a result, as of December 31, 2021, our relationship with Genesis was comprised of three properties owned 100% by us and master leased to Genesis, which are currently classified as held for sale, a loan balance net of allowance for credit losses of $154,476,000, approximately 9.5 million shares of GEN Series A common stock and a 25% ownership stake in an unconsolidated joint venture that includes two master leases for 28 properties operated by Genesis.\n3\nOutpatient Medical\nOutpatient Medical Buildings\nDemand for outpatient medical services is growing as more procedures are performed safely and efficiently outside the hospital setting. State-of-the-art outpatient centers are needed in accessible, consumer-friendly locations. Our portfolio of outpatient medical buildings is an integral part of creating health care provider connectivity in local markets and generally include physician offices, ambulatory surgery centers, diagnostic facilities, outpatient services and/or labs. Approximately 87% of our outpatient medical building portfolio is affiliated with health systems (buildings directly on or adjacent to hospital campuses or with tenants that are satellite locations for the health system and its physicians). We typically lease our outpatient medical buildings to multiple tenants and provide varying levels of property management. Our Outpatient Medical segment accounted for 13%, 16%\nand\n13% of total revenues for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No single tenant exceeds 20% of segment revenues.\nInvestments\nProviding high-quality and affordable health care to an aging global population requires vast investments and infrastructure development. We invest in seniors housing and health care real estate primarily through acquisitions, developments and joint venture partnerships. For additional information regarding acquisition and development activity, please see Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements. Our portfolio creates opportunities to connect partners across the continuum of care and drive efficiency. We seek to diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location. In determining whether to invest in a property, we focus on the following: (1) the experience of the obligor’s/partner’s management team; (2) the historical and projected financial and operational performance of the property; (3) the credit of the obligor/partner; (4) the security for any lease or loan; (5) the real estate attributes of the building and its location; (6) the capital committed to the property by the obligor/partner; and (7) the operating fundamentals of the applicable industry.\nWe monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections, and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of, among other things, tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs, and market conditions.\nInvestment Types\nReal Property\nOur properties are primarily comprised of land, buildings, improvements and related rights. Our triple-net properties are generally leased to operators under long-term operating leases. The leases generally have a fixed contractual term of 12 to 15 years and contain one or more five to 15-year renewal options. Certain of our leases also contain purchase options, a portion of which could result in the disposition of properties for less than full market value if the options were to be exercised. Most of our rents are received under triple-net leases requiring the operator to pay rent and all additional charges incurred in the operation of the leased property. The tenants are required to repair, rebuild and maintain the leased properties. Substantially all these operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period.\nAt December 31, 2021, approximately 94% of our triple-net properties were subject to master leases. A master lease is a lease of multiple properties to one tenant entity under a single lease agreement. From time to time, we may acquire additional properties that are then leased to the tenant under the master lease. The tenant is required to make one monthly payment that represents rent on all the properties that are subject to the master lease. Typically, the master lease tenant can exercise its right to purchase the properties or to renew the master lease only with respect to all leased properties at the same time. We believe this bundling feature benefits us because the tenant cannot limit the purchase or renewal to better performing properties and terminate the leasing arrangement with respect to poorer performing properties. This spreads our risk among the entire group of properties within the master lease. The bundling feature should provide a similar advantage to us if the master lease tenant is in bankruptcy. Subject to certain restrictions, a debtor in bankruptcy has the right to assume or reject its unexpired leases and executory contracts. In the context of integrated master leases such as ours, our tenants in bankruptcy would be required to assume or reject the master lease as a whole, rather than deciding on a property by property basis.\nOur Outpatient Medical portfolio is primarily self-managed and consists mainly of multi-tenant properties leased to health care providers. Our leases typically include increasers and some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. As of December 31, 2021, 65% of our portfolio included leases with full pass through, 30% with a partial expense reimbursement (modified gross) and 5% with no expense reimbursement (gross). Our outpatient medical leases are non-cancellable operating leases that have a weighted-average remaining term of five years at December 31, 2021 and are often credit enhanced by security deposits, guarantees and/or letters of credit.\n4\nConstruction\nWe provide for the construction of properties for tenants primarily as part of long-term operating leases. We capitalize certain interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the amount advanced during the construction period using the rate of interest that approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest expense is reduced by the amount capitalized. The construction period commences upon funding and terminates upon the earlier of the completion of the applicable property or the end of a specified period. During the construction period, we advance funds to the tenants in accordance with agreed upon terms and conditions which require, among other things, periodic site visits by a company representative. During the construction period, we generally require an additional credit enhancement in the form of payment and performance bonds and/or completion guarantees. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding construction investments of $651,389,000 and were committed to provide additional funds of approximately $1,208,913,000 to complete construction for consolidated investment properties. We also provide for construction loans which, depending on the terms and conditions, could be treated as loans, real property or investments in unconsolidated entities.\nLoans\nOur real estate loans are typically structured to provide us with interest income, principal amortization and transaction fees. Real estate loans consist of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a leasehold mortgage on, or an assignment of the partnership interest in the related properties, corporate guarantees and/or personal guarantees. Non-real estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding loans, net of allowances, of $1,292,308,000 with an interest yield of approximately 11.2% per annum. Our yield on loans depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments. The loans outstanding at December 31, 2021 are generally subject to one to 15-year terms with principal amortization schedules and/or balloon payments of the outstanding principal balances at the end of the term.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in entities that we do not consolidate but for which we can exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. At December 31, 2021, we had investments in unconsolidated entities of $1,039,043,000. Our investments in unconsolidated entities generally represent interests ranging from 10% to 65% in real estate assets. Under the equity method of accounting, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest inclusive of transaction costs. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.\nIn Substance Real Estate\nAdditionally, we provide loans to third parties for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under these arrangements, it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or acquisition of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. Arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments, accounted for using the equity method, and are presented as investments in unconsolidated entities. We have made loans related to twelve properties with a carrying value of\n$317,647,000\nas of December 31, 2021, which are classified as in substance real estate investments.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are in conformity with U.S general accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture entities that we control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAt inception of joint venture transactions, we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, \"Consolidations\", requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance.\nFor investments in joint ventures, U.S. GAAP may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partner(s). We assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions, and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.\n5\nBorrowing Policies\nWe utilize a combination of debt and equity to fund investments. Generally, we intend to issue unsecured, fixed-rate public debt with long-term maturities to approximate the maturities on our triple-net leases and investment strategy. For short-term purposes, we may borrow on our primary unsecured credit facility or issue commercial paper. We replace these borrowings with long-term capital such as senior unsecured notes or common stock. When terms are deemed favorable, we may invest in properties subject to existing mortgage indebtedness. In addition, we may obtain secured financing for unleveraged properties in which we have invested or may refinance properties acquired on a leveraged basis. In certain agreements with our lenders, we are subject to restrictions with respect to secured and unsecured indebtedness.\nCompetition\nWe compete with other real estate investment trusts, real estate partnerships, private equity and hedge fund investors, banks, insurance companies, finance/investment companies, government-sponsored agencies, taxable and tax-exempt bond funds, health care operators, developers and other investors in the acquisition, development, leasing and financing of health care and seniors housing properties. We compete for investments based on a number of factors including relationships, certainty of execution, investment structures and underwriting criteria. Our ability to successfully compete is impacted by economic and demographic trends, availability of acceptable investment opportunities, our ability to negotiate beneficial investment terms, availability and cost of capital, construction and renovation costs and applicable laws and regulations.\nThe operators/tenants of our properties compete with properties that provide comparable services in the local markets.  Operators/tenants compete for patients and residents based on a number of factors including quality of care, reputation, physical appearance of properties, location, services offered, family preferences (including a preference for home health services instead of residing in one of our communities), physicians, staff and price. Throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, seniors housing operators have experienced broad-based occupancy declines and as a result, we expect competition to continue in 2022 and beyond as operators attempt to fill unoccupied units. We also face competition from other health care facilities for tenants, such as physicians and other health care providers that provide comparable facilities and services.\nFor additional information on the risks associated with our business, please see “Item 1A — Risk Factors” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Approach\nWe are committed to operating in a responsible, transparent and sustainable manner. Our leadership and Board of Directors (through the Nominating Corporate/Governance Committee), oversee and advance our ESG initiatives. We recognize that focusing on ESG engagement, integration and impact benefit our stakeholders and are fundamental to our business. Our corporate responsibility and sustainability strategy is focused on adopting leading ESG practices across our business and we were recognized for our leadership in this space over the past year in the following ways:\n•\nElevated by CDP to the highest available band level of leadership with an improved score of “A-” for taking coordinated action on climate issues;\n•\nRaised MSCI ESG rating from A to AA;\n•\nNamed in 2021 to the Dow Jones Sustainability North American Index for the sixth consecutive year;\n•\nListed in the FTSE4Good Index since 2012;\n•\nRecognized by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Department of Energy as an ENERGY STAR Partner of the Year for the third consecutive year and elevated to the level of Sustained Excellence, the EPA’s highest recognition within the ENERGY STAR program;\n•\nMaintained Gold Level Green Lease Leader status by the Institute for Market Transformation and the U.S. Department of Energy’s Better Buildings Alliance;\n•\nNamed to the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index for the third consecutive year;\n•\nNamed to the Workplace Health Achievement Index by the American Heart Association for the fourth consecutive year, and increased from Bronze to Silver level;\n•\nMaintained Prime status under the ISS-ESG Corporate rating for the third consecutive year;\n•\nNamed by S&P Global in collaboration with RobecoSAM for the fourth consecutive year in the 2021 edition of The Sustainability Yearbook;\n•\nNamed to the top 20 percent of Newsweek’s America’s Most Responsible Companies list for the third consecutive year;\n•\nNamed to Sustainalytics 2021 Top-Rated ESG Companies list;\n•\nNamed as one of the top sustainable REITs in Barron’s list of America’s Most Sustainable Companies for the second consecutive year;\n6\n•\nHonored at the Women’s Forum of New York Breakfast of Champions for the second time for our representation of women on our Board of Directors; and\n•\nOpened Sunrise at East 56th, the recipient of all three LEED Silver, WELL Certification at the Silver level, and WELL Health-Safety Rating Seal certifications.\nEnvironmental\nWe strive to reduce our environmental impact by increasing energy and water efficiency, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, and by investing in projects that reduce energy and water consumption that meet our rate of return threshold. After several years of portfolio and program evolution, along with our increased ability to collect data in partnership with our operators and tenants, our property-level sustainability dataset (energy, greenhouse gas (\"GHG\"), water, and waste) is evolving to become a set of tools for benchmarking. A portion of our self-managed Outpatient Medical portfolio is benchmarked in EPA ENERGY STAR Portfolio Manager (\"ESPM\") and we regularly engage with our operators and tenants on ENERGY STAR, utility bill aggregators, utility companies, and others to add to our number of ESPM benchmarked properties throughout our portfolio. In 2021, we continued to work towards our goals of a 10% reduction in GHG emissions and energy and water usage by 2025 from our 2018 baseline.\nWe have employee, tenant, operator/manager and vendor engagement programs in place, focused on operational strategies to drive energy and water efficiency. We have issued guidance with accompanying training to assist them to successfully benchmark our buildings and to engage them to improve energy and water efficiency, as well as increase their recycling diversion rates.\nIn December 2019, we issued our inaugural green bond of $500,000,000 of 2.700% notes due 2027. The net proceeds from the offering have been, and continue to be, used to fund energy efficiency, water conservation and green building projects. As of September 30, 2021, we have utilized $277,732,000 of proceeds from this issuance on such projects.\nWe understand that as we continue to make our operations and buildings more sustainable, we also have a responsibility to effectuate the same in our supply chain and our purchasing decisions. As such, we partner with suppliers that offer take back programs for their products, look for the ENERGY STAR label when purchasing eligible items, seek to purchase office supply products that contain recycled content and purchase paper products that are either Forest Stewardship Council or Sustainable Forestry Initiative certified.\nSocial\nWe value and are committed to our employees. We believe that a diverse workplace produces a variety of perspectives, motivates employees and helps us understand and better serve our stakeholders, and the communities in which we do business. As of December 31, 2021, our U.S. employees self-identified as follows:\nWe have reinforced our already strong commitment to diversity and inclusion through our Diversity Council and support of our eight employee network groups (\"ENGs\"). Our ENGs include women, families, racial and ethnic minorities, military, young professionals, and those who identify as LGBTQI+ and their allies. Our ENGs provide support, education, networking opportunities and community belonging for our employees. Our support of diversity and inclusion through our Diversity Council and ENGs, taken together with other employee initiatives, such as tailored messaging, training and discussions on equality and belonging, support our efforts to compete for and foster talent and inclusiveness in an ever-changing workforce.\nIn addition, we have several social initiatives in place that are focused on fostering a more diverse workforce, engaging with our communities and promoting the health and well-being of our employees, tenants and residents. The Welltower Charitable Foundation (the \"Foundation\") financially supports charitable initiatives related to aging, health care, the environment, education and the arts. We encourage our employees to give back to the community by matching their contributions and donating their time to eligible charitable organizations. Funds are also allocated to each of our ENGs to make charitable contributions in support of their programming efforts. Additionally, the Foundation facilitates presentations for charities to compete in the Give-WELL campaign. This campaign enables our employees to present and vote for charities that will receive donations from the Foundation. During 2021, we sponsored our second annual Day of Giving so our employees could collaborate to make an impact with local charitable organizations through volunteer opportunities. See Human Capital section below for additional information regarding employee initiatives and programs.\n7\nGovernance\nOur commitment to diversity starts at the top with a highly knowledgeable, skilled and diverse Board of Directors. As of December 31, 2021, our 11 Directors self-identified as follows:\nTen of our 11 Directors are independent and the independent Chair of our Board is held by a Black/African American male. Four or 36% of our five Board committees are chaired by either a Female (2), Hispanic/Latino (1) or Black/African American (1) Director.\nAdditional information regarding our ESG programs and initiatives is available in our 2020 Environmental, Social and Governance Report (located on our website at www.welltower.com). Information on our website, including our Environmental, Social and Governance Report or sections thereof, is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report.\nHuman Capital\nOur employees are our greatest asset. As of December 31, 2021\n, we had 464 employees (443 located in United States, 13 in the United Kingdom, six in Canada and two in Luxembourg). We are committed to the success of our people and the unique combination of skills and experiences they bring to achieving our mission.\nEmployee Engagement\nHigh employee engagement and satisfaction are critical to attracting and retaining top talent. During 2021, we conducted an employee engagement survey through an independent third party, measuring our progress on important employee issues such as manager relationships, employee empowerment, performance management and resources and support, and identifying opportunities for growth and improvement. Scores have been shared with all managers and action plans to improve and prioritize focus areas are being put into place.\nEmployee Development Programs and Performance Management\nDevelopment through the talent pipeline, recognizing and rewarding performance and providing opportunities for continued growth are the cornerstones of our Human Capital strategy. We offer employees resources, trainings and tools designed to develop future leaders, advance careers and attract and retain talent including but not limited to our robust early career programs, formal mentorship and coaching programs, manager development training, skill development courses and education assistance. During 2021, we launched executive management coaching programs to equip leaders with structured 360 feedback, customized development plans and guidance on company-wide succession planning. For our vice presidents, we partnered with a virtual coaching platform that scales individual access to expert coaches, training opportunities and enables behavioral change through award-winning artificial intelligence. For our senior vice presidents, we partnered with an independent advisory firm to provide one-on-one coaching, including an extensive 360 feedback process to focus on maximizing their executive leadership potential.\nCompensation and Benefits\nIn addition to salary, our compensation and benefits programs include annual short term incentive bonuses, long-term incentive stock awards, retirement plans, an employee stock purchase plan, healthcare and insurance benefits, health savings and flexible spending accounts, paid time off, maternity and caregiver leave, senior wellness leave, employee assistance programs, tuition assistance and health and wellness reimbursement programs, among many others. With the assistance of independent third parties, we annually evaluate and benchmark the competitiveness of our compensation and benefits programs focusing on fair pay practices that reward performance and support the needs of our employees.\nHealth, Safety and Wellness\nThe success of our business is fundamentally connected to the safety and well-being of our employees, tenants, operators and managers, and their residents and visitors, as the case may be. We provide our employees and their families with access to numerous innovative, flexible and convenient health and wellness programs that support physical, mental and financial well-being. As we continued to navigate COVID-19 in 2021, we took a number of actions designed to provide for the safety and well-being of our employees such as allowing remote and hybrid work, and flexible schedules where feasible, establishing office protocols for employee safety, conducting training courses on COVID-19 prevention and encouraging COVID-19 vaccinations and boosters across our workforce through paid time off in order to obtain vaccinations and boosters and manage side effects. Also during 2021, we increased internal communications across the organization through podcasts, town hall meetings, team events (virtually and in person) and dedicated communication channels for the ENGs, resulting in more connectivity and engagement. We continued to provide access to personal protective equipment, and enhanced cleaning and sanitation procedures.\nCredit Concentrations\nPlease see Note 9 to our consolidated financial statements.\nGeographic Concentrations\nPlease see “Item 2 – Properties” below and Note 18 to our consolidated financial statements.\n8\nCertain Government Regulations\nUnited States\nHealth Law Matters — Generally\nTypically, operators of seniors housing facilities do not receive significant funding from government programs and are largely subject to state laws, as opposed to federal laws. Operators of long-term/post-acute care facilities and hospitals do receive significant funding from government programs, and these facilities are subject to extensive regulation, including federal and state laws covering the type and quality of medical and/or nursing care provided, ancillary services (\ne.g\n., respiratory, occupational, physical and infusion therapies), qualifications of the administrative personnel and nursing staff, the adequacy of the physical plant and equipment, reimbursement and rate setting and operating policies. In addition, as described below, operators of these facilities are subject to extensive laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, including, but not limited to, the federal Anti-Kickback Statute (“AKS”), the federal Stark Law (“Stark Law”), and the federal False Claims Act (“FCA”), as well as comparable state laws. Hospitals, physician group practice clinics, and other health care providers that operate in our portfolio are subject to extensive federal, state, and local licensure, registration, certification, and inspection laws, regulations, and industry standards, as well as other conditions of participation in federal and state government programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Further, operators of long-term care facilities are required to have in place compliance and ethics programs that meet the requirements of federal laws and regulations. Our tenants’ failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in, among other things: loss of accreditation; denial of reimbursement; imposition of fines; suspension, decertification, or exclusion from federal and state health care programs; loss of license; or closure of the facility. See risk factors “The requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare or Medicaid, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us” and “Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us” in “Item 1A – Risk Factors” below. Moreover, in light of certain arrangements that Welltower may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to laws and regulations pertaining to health care fraud and abuse, and, given that certain of our arrangements are structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (\"RIDEA\"), certain health care fraud and abuse laws and data privacy laws could apply directly to Welltower. See risk factor \"We assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations, and financial condition\" in \"Item 1A - Risk Factors\" below.\nLicensing and Certification\nThe primary regulations that affect seniors housing facilities are state licensing and certification laws. For example, certain health care facilities are subject to a variety of licensure and certificate of need (“CON”) laws and regulations. Where applicable, CON laws generally require, among other requirements, that a facility demonstrate the need for (1) constructing a new facility, (2) adding beds or expanding an existing facility, (3) investing in major capital equipment or adding new services, (4) changing the ownership or control of an existing licensed facility or (5) terminating services that have been previously approved through the CON process. Certain state CON laws and regulations may restrict the ability of operators to add new properties or expand an existing facility’s size or services. In addition, CON laws may constrain the ability of an operator to transfer responsibility for operating a particular facility to a new operator.\nWith respect to licensure, generally our long-term/post-acute care facilities are required to be licensed by the applicable state  regulatory authority and certified for participation in Medicare, Medicaid and other federal and state health care programs. The failure of our operators to maintain or renew any required license or regulatory approval as well as the failure of our operators to correct serious deficiencies identified in a compliance survey could require those operators to discontinue operations at a property. In addition, if a property is found to be out of compliance with Medicare, Medicaid or other federal or state health care program conditions of participation, the property operator may be excluded from participating in those government health care programs.\nReimbursement\nThe reimbursement methodologies applied to health care facilities continue to evolve. Federal and state authorities have considered and implemented and may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies, including value-based reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. Likewise, third-party payors may continue imposing greater controls on operators, including through changes in reimbursement rates and fee structures. The impact of any such changes, if implemented, may result in a material adverse effect on our portfolio. No assurance can be given that current revenue sources or levels will be maintained. Accordingly, there can be no assurance that payments under a government health care program are currently, or will be in the future, sufficient to fully reimburse the property operators for their operating and capital expenses.\n9\n•\nSeniors Housing Facilities\nThe majority of the revenues received by the operators of U.S. seniors housing facilities are from private pay sources. The remaining revenue source is primarily Medicaid provided under state waiver programs for home and community-based care. There can be no guarantee that a state Medicaid program operating pursuant to a waiver will be able to maintain its waiver status. Rates paid by self-pay residents are set by the facilities and are determined by local market conditions and operating costs. Generally, facilities receive a higher payment per day for a private pay resident than for a Medicaid beneficiary who requires a comparable level of care. The level of Medicaid reimbursement varies from state to state. Thus, the revenues generated by operators of our assisted living facilities may be adversely affected by payor mix, acuity level, or changes in Medicaid eligibility and reimbursement levels.\n•\nLong-Term/Post-Acute Care Facilities\nThe majority of the revenues received by the operators of these facilities are from the Medicare and Medicaid programs, with the balance representing reimbursement payments from private payors and patients. Consequently, changes in federal or state reimbursement policies may adversely affect an operator’s ability to cover its expenses, including our rent or debt service. Long-term/post-acute care facilities are subject to periodic pre- and post-payment reviews and other audits by federal and state authorities. A review or audit of a property operator’s claims could result in recoupments, denials or delay of payments in the future. Due to the significant judgments and estimates inherent in payor settlement accounting, no assurance can be given as to the adequacy of any reserves maintained by our property operators to cover potential adjustments to reimbursements or to cover settlements made to payors.\n◦\nMedicare Reimbursement\nGenerally, long-term/post-acute care facilities are reimbursed by Medicare under prospective payment systems, which generally provide reimbursement based upon a predetermined fixed amount per episode of care and are updated by CMS, an agency of the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”) annually. There is a risk under these payment systems that costs will exceed the fixed payments, or that payments may be set below the costs to provide certain items and services. Further, there is risk that Medicare Skilled Nursing Facility (\"SNF\") payment reforms may impact our tenants and operators. In addition, the HHS Office of Inspector General has released recommendations to address SNF billing practices and Medicare payment rates. If followed, these recommendations regarding SNF payment reform may impact our tenants and operators.\n◦\nMedicaid Reimbursement\nMany states reimburse SNFs using fixed daily rates, which are applied prospectively based on patient acuity and the historical costs incurred in providing patient care. In most states, Medicaid does not fully reimburse the cost of providing services. Certain states are attempting to slow the rate of Medicaid growth by freezing rates or restricting eligibility and benefits. In addition, Medicaid reimbursement rates may decline if state revenues in a particular state are not sufficient to fund budgeted expenditures.\n•\nMedicare Reimbursement for Physicians, Hospital Outpatient Departments (“HOPDs”), and Ambulatory Surgical Centers (“ASCs”)\nChanges in reimbursement to physicians, HOPDs and ASCs may further affect our tenants and operators. Generally, Medicare reimburses physicians under the Physician Fee Schedule, while HOPDs and ASCs are reimbursed under prospective payment systems. The Physician Fee Schedule and the HOPD and ASC prospective payment systems are updated annually by CMS. These annual Medicare payment regulations have resulted in lower net pay increases than providers of those services have often expected. In addition, the Medicare and Children’s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2015 (“MACRA”) includes payment reductions for providers who do not meet government quality standards. The implementation of pay-for-quality models like those required under MACRA has the potential to produce funding disparities that could adversely impact some provider tenants in outpatient medical buildings and other health care properties. Changes in Medicare Advantage plan payments may also indirectly affect our operators and tenants that contract with Medicare Advantage plans.\n•\nHealth Reform Laws\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010 (collectively, the “Health Reform Laws”) dramatically altered how health care is delivered and reimbursed in the U.S. and contained various provisions, including Medicaid expansion and the establishment of Health Insurance Exchanges (“HIEs”) providing subsidized health insurance, that may directly impact us or the operators and tenants of our properties. The status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change as a result of political, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. While there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws through legislative action and legal challenges, legislative attempts to completely repeal the Health Reform Laws have been unsuccessful to date, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Health Reform Laws brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Health Reform Laws. Nevertheless, the status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change and other health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political, legislative, regulatory and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. Further, the impact that the Biden Administration or U.S. Congress may have on health reform (including through new legislative, executive order, or regulatory efforts) remains uncertain, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws. We cannot predict whether the existing Health Reform Laws, or future health care reform legislation, executive order, or regulatory changes, will have a material impact on our operators’ or tenants’ property or business.\n10\nFraud & Abuse Enforcement\nLong-term/post-acute care facilities (and seniors housing facilities that receive Medicaid payments) are subject to federal, state, and local laws, regulations, and applicable guidance that govern the operations and financial and other arrangements that may be entered into by health care providers. Certain of these laws, such as the AKS and Stark Law, prohibit direct or indirect payments of any kind for the purpose of inducing or encouraging the referral of patients for medical products or services reimbursable by government health care programs. Other government health program laws require providers to furnish only medically necessary services and submit to the government valid and accurate statements for each service. Our operators and tenants that receive payments from federal health care programs, such as Medicare and Medicaid, are subject to substantial financial penalties under the Civil Monetary Penalties Act and the FCA upon a finding of noncompliance with such laws. In addition, states may also have separate false claims acts, which, among other things, generally prohibit health care providers from filing false claims or making false statements to receive payments. Federal and state FCAs contain \"whistleblower\" provisions that permit private individuals to bring health care fraud enforcement claims on behalf of the government. Still other laws require providers to comply with a variety of safety, health and other requirements relating to the condition of the licensed property and the quality of care provided. Sanctions for violations of these laws, regulations and other applicable guidance may include, but are not limited to, criminal and/or civil penalties and fines, loss of licensure, immediate termination of government payments, exclusion from any government health care program, damage assessments and imprisonment. In certain circumstances, violation of these rules (such as those prohibiting abusive and fraudulent behavior) with respect to one property may subject other facilities under common control or ownership to sanctions, including exclusion from participation in the Medicare and Medicaid programs, as well as other government health care programs, and revocation of healthcare licenses. In the ordinary course of its business, a property operator is regularly subjected to inquiries, investigations and audits by the federal and state agencies that oversee these laws and regulations.\nProsecutions, investigations or whistleblower actions could have a material adverse effect on a property operator’s liquidity, financial condition, and operations, which could adversely affect the ability of the operator to meet its financial obligations to us. In addition, government investigations and enforcement actions brought against the health care industry have increased dramatically over the past several years and are expected to continue. The costs for an operator of a health care property associated with both defending such enforcement actions and the undertakings in settling these actions can be substantial and could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. In addition, Welltower could potentially be directly subject to these health care fraud and abuse laws, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain collaboration or other arrangements we may pursue with stakeholders who are directly subject to these laws.\nFederal and State Data Privacy and Security Laws\nThe Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”), as amended by the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act, and numerous other state and federal laws govern the collection, security, dissemination, use, access to and confidentiality of personal information, including individually identifiable health information. Violations of these laws may result in substantial civil and/or criminal fines and penalties. The costs to a business such as ours or to an operator of a health care property associated with developing and maintaining programs and systems to comply with data privacy and security laws, defending against privacy and security related claims or enforcement actions and paying any assessed fines, can be substantial. Moreover, such costs could have a material adverse effect on the ability of an operator to meet its obligations to us. Finally, data privacy and security laws and regulations continue to develop, including with regard to HIPAA and U.S. state privacy laws such as the California Consumer Privacy Act and the new California Privacy Rights Act, and other similar laws in Colorado and Virginia that will go into effect in 2023. As we use data to better inform our investments and the efficacy of care in our communities, these developments may add potential uncertainty and costs towards compliance obligations, business operations or transactions that depend on data. These new privacy laws may create restrictions or requirements in our, our operators' and other business partners' use, sharing and securing of data. New privacy and security laws could require substantial investment in resources to comply with regulatory changes as privacy and security laws proliferate in divergent ways or impose additional obligations, and potentially create new privacy related legal risks.\nUnited Kingdom\nIn the U.K., care home services are principally regulated by the Health and Social Care Act 2008 (as amended) and other regulations. This legislation subjects service providers to a number of legally binding “Fundamental Standards” and requires, amongst other things, that all persons carrying out “Regulated Activities” in the U.K., and the managers of such persons, be registered. Providers of care home services are also subject (as data controllers) to laws governing their use of personal data (including in relation to their employees, clients and recipients of their services). These laws currently take the form of the U.K.’s Data Protection Act 2018 and the U.K. General Data Protection Regulation (collectively “U.K. DP Laws”). U.K. DP Laws impose a significant number of obligations on controllers with the potential for fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or £17.5 million, whichever is greater. Further, to the extent that an entity established in the U.K. or any other jurisdiction offers goods or services to individuals in the European Economic Area, that entity may also be subject to the E.U. General Data Protection Regulation (\"E.U. GDPR\"). Similarly, the E.U. GDPR imposes obligations on controllers with the\n11\npotential for fines of up to 4% of annual worldwide turnover or €20 million, whichever is greater. Entities incorporated in or carrying on a business in the U.K., as well as individuals residing in the U.K., are also subject to the U.K. Bribery Act 2010. The U.K. has national minimum wage legislation with a maximum fine for non-payment of £20,000 per worker and employers who fail to pay will be banned from being a company director for up to 15 years. In addition, there is a bill currently going through the U.K. Parliament which will require a care home provider, where entering into a contract for the provision of healthcare or social care services with a local public authority, to enter into mandatory contractual terms to provide the local public authority with evidence that it pays the national minimum wage to all of its employees engaged in the provision of services for which the provider has contracted for (e.g., a national minimum wage record). Further, the Working Time and Holiday Pay Bill 2019-2021 is currently going through the U.K. Parliament, which makes provision for the expiration of the Working Time Regulations 1998, provides for additional regulations governing working time and makes provisions for holiday pay for employees.\nCanada\nSenior living residences in Canada are provincially regulated. Within each province, there are different categories for senior living residences that are generally based on the level of care sought and/or required by a resident (e.g. assisted or retirement living, senior living residences, residential care, long-term care). In some of these categories and depending on the province, residences may be government funded, or the individual residents may be eligible for a government subsidy, while other residences are exclusively private-pay. The governing legislation and regulations vary by province, but generally the object of the laws is to set licensing requirements and minimum standards for senior living residences, and regulate operations. These laws empower regulators in each province to take a variety of steps to ensure compliance, conduct inspections, issue reports and generally regulate the industry.\nOur operations in Canada are subject to privacy legislation, including, in certain provinces, privacy laws specifically related to personal health information. Although the obligations of senior living residences in the various provinces differ, they all include the obligation to protect personal information. Under some of these laws, notification to the regulator in the event of an actual or suspected privacy breach is mandatory. The powers of privacy regulators and penalties for violations of privacy law vary according to the applicable law or are left to the courts. In September 2021, the province of Quebec adopted significant amendments to its privacy legislation, including a new enforcement scheme with significant penalties and fines: up to CAD $10 million or 2% of global turnover (whichever is greater) for administrative monetary penalties and up to CAD $25 million or 4% of global turnover for penal fines. The amendments will go into effect in three stages: (i) a few provisions on September 22, 2022, (ii) most provisions on September 22, 2023 (including the new enforcement scheme), and (iii) one provision on September 23, 2024. Senior living residences may also be subject to laws pertaining to residential tenancy, provincial and/or municipal laws applicable to fire safety, food services, zoning, occupational health and safety, public health and the provision of community health care and funded long-term/post-acute care.\nTaxation\nThe following summary of the taxation of the company and the material U.S. federal income tax consequences to the holders of our debt and equity securities is for general information only and is not tax advice. This summary does not address all aspects of taxation that may be relevant to certain types of holders of stock or securities (including, but not limited to, insurance companies, tax-exempt entities, financial institutions or broker-dealers, persons holding shares of common stock as part of a hedging, integrated conversion, or constructive sale transaction or a straddle, traders in securities that use a mark-to-market method of accounting for their securities, investors in pass-through entities and foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the United States).\nThis summary does not discuss all of the aspects of U.S. federal income taxation that may be relevant to you in light of your particular investment or other circumstances. In addition, this summary does not discuss any state or local income taxation or foreign income taxation or other foreign tax consequences. This summary is based on current U.S. federal income tax laws. A discussion of the potential implications to the Company of the Tax Act is provided at the end of this summary below. Subsequent developments in U.S. federal income tax law, including changes in law or differing interpretations, which may be applied retroactively, could have a material effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of purchasing, owning and disposing of our securities as set forth in this summary. Before you purchase our securities, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the particular U.S. federal, state, local, foreign and other tax consequences of acquiring, owning and selling our securities.\nGeneral\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our first taxable year. We intend to continue to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a REIT, but there is no guarantee that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT for subsequent years. Qualification and taxation as a REIT depends upon our ability to meet a variety of qualification tests imposed under U.S. federal income tax law with respect to our income, assets, distributions and share ownership, as discussed below under “Qualification as a REIT.” There can be no assurance that we will qualify or remain qualified as a REIT.\n12\nIn any year in which we qualify as a REIT, in general, we will not be subject to U.S. federal income tax on that portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. We may, however, be subject to tax at normal corporate rates on any taxable income or capital gain not distributed. If we elect to retain and pay income tax on our net capital gain, stockholders would be taxed on their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain and would receive a refundable credit for their share of any taxes paid by us on such gain.\nDespite the REIT election, we may be subject to U.S. federal income and excise tax as follows:\n•\nTo the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates;\n•\nIf we have net income from the sale or other disposition of “foreclosure property” that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business or other non-qualifying income from foreclosure property, such income will be taxed at the highest corporate rate;\n•\nAny net income from prohibited transactions (which are, in general, sales or other dispositions of property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business, other than dispositions of foreclosure property) will be subject to a 100% tax;\n•\nIf we fail to satisfy either the 75% or 95% gross income tests (as discussed below), but nonetheless maintain our qualification as a REIT because certain other requirements are met, we will be subject to a 100% tax on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable to the greater of (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% gross income test (discussed below) or (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% gross income test (discussed below) multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability;\n•\nIf we fail to distribute during each year at least the sum of (1) 85% of our REIT ordinary income for the year, (2) 95% of our REIT capital gain net income for such year (other than capital gain that we elect to retain and pay tax on) and (3) any undistributed taxable income from preceding periods, we will be subject to a 4% excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over amounts actually distributed; and\n•\nWe will be subject to a 100% tax on certain amounts from certain transactions involving our “taxable REIT subsidiaries” that are not conducted on an arm’s length basis. See “Qualification as a REIT - Investments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries.\nIf we acquire any assets from a corporation, which is or has been a “C” corporation, in a carryover basis transaction (including where a “C” corporation elects REIT status), we could be liable for specified liabilities that are inherited from the “C” corporation. A “C” corporation is generally defined as a corporation that is required to pay full corporate level U.S. federal income tax. If we recognize gain on the disposition of the assets during the five-year period beginning on the date on which the assets were acquired by us, then, to the extent of the assets’ “built-in gain” (e.g., the excess of the fair market value of the asset over the adjusted tax basis of the asset, in each case determined as of the beginning of the five-year period), we will be subject to tax on the gain at the highest regular corporate rate applicable. The results described in this paragraph with respect to the recognition of built-in gain assume that the “C” corporation did not make and was not treated as making an election to treat the built-in gain assets as sold to an unrelated party. For those properties that are subject to the built-in gains tax, the potential amount of built-in gains tax will be an additional factor when considering a possible sale of the properties within the five-year period beginning on the date on which the properties were acquired by us. See Note 19 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the built-in gains tax.\nQualification as a REIT\nA REIT is defined as a corporation, trust or association:\n(1) which is managed by one or more trustees or directors;\n(2) the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest;\n(3) which would be taxable as a domestic corporation but for the U.S. federal income tax law relating to REITs;\n(4) which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company;\n(5) the beneficial ownership of which is held by 100 or more persons in each taxable year of the REIT except for its first\ntaxable year;\n(6) not more than 50% in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned during the last half of each taxable year, excluding its first taxable year, directly, indirectly or constructively, by or for five or fewer individuals (which includes certain entities) (the “Five or Fewer Requirement”); and\n(7) which meets certain income and asset tests described below.\n13\nConditions (1) to (4), inclusive, must be met during the entire taxable year and condition (5) must be met during at least 335 days of a taxable year of 12 months or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than 12 months. For purposes of conditions (5) and (6), pension funds and certain other tax-exempt entities are treated as individuals, subject to a “look-through” exception in the case of condition (6).\nBased on publicly available information, we believe we have satisfied the share ownership requirements set forth in (5) and (6) above. In addition, Article VI of our by-laws provides for restrictions regarding ownership and transfer of shares. These restrictions are intended to assist us in continuing to satisfy the share ownership requirements described in (5) and (6) above but may not ensure that we will, in all cases, be able to satisfy such requirements.\nWe have complied with, and will continue to comply with, regulatory rules to send annual letters to certain of our stockholders requesting information regarding the actual ownership of our stock. If, despite sending the annual letters, we do not know, or after exercising reasonable diligence would not have known, whether we failed to meet the Five or Fewer Requirement, we will be treated as having met the Five or Fewer Requirement. If we fail to comply with these regulatory rules, we will be subject to a monetary penalty. If our failure to comply were due to intentional disregard of the requirement, the penalty would be increased. However, if our failure to comply were due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect, no penalty would be imposed.\nWe may own a number of properties through wholly owned subsidiaries. A corporation will qualify as a “qualified REIT subsidiary” if 100% of its stock is owned by a REIT, and the REIT does not elect to treat the subsidiary as a taxable REIT subsidiary. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” will not be treated as a separate corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, and all assets, liabilities and items of income, deductions and credits of a “qualified REIT subsidiary” will be treated as assets, liabilities and items (as the case may be) of the REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. A “qualified REIT subsidiary” is not subject to U.S. federal income tax, and our ownership of the voting stock of a qualified REIT subsidiary will not violate the restrictions against ownership of securities of any one issuer which constitute more than 10% of the value or total voting power of such issuer or more than 5% of the value of our total assets, as described below under “- Asset Tests.”\nIf we invest in an entity treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes, we will be deemed to own a proportionate share of the entity’s assets. Likewise, we will be treated as receiving our share of the income and loss of the entity, and the gross income will retain the same character in our hands as it has in the hands of the entity. These “look-through” rules apply for purposes of the income tests and assets tests described below.\nThe deduction of business interest is limited to 30% (50% in the case of taxable years beginning in 2019 or 2020) of adjusted taxable income, which may limit the deductibility of interest expense by us, our taxable REIT subsidiaries, or our joint venture and partnership arrangements. A “real property trade or business” may irrevocably elect out of the applicability of the limitation, but if it does so it must use the less favorable alternative depreciation system to depreciate real property used in the trade or business. Regulations provide guidance on how to allocate interest deductions among multiple trades or businesses and contain special rules, including a safe harbor, regarding the allocation of a REIT’s interest deductions to a “real property trade or business.”\nIncome Tests\nThere are two separate percentage tests relating to our sources of gross income that we must satisfy each taxable year:\n•\nAt least 75% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from “rents from real property,” other income from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property or certain income from qualified temporary investments.\n•\nAt least 95% of our gross income (excluding gross income from certain sales of property held primarily for sale) generally must be directly or indirectly derived each taxable year from any of the sources qualifying for the 75% gross income test and from dividends (including dividends from taxable REIT subsidiaries) and interest.\nIncome from hedging and foreign currency transactions is excluded from the 95% and 75% gross income tests if certain requirements are met but otherwise will constitute gross income which does not qualify under the 95% or 75% gross income tests.\nRents received by us will qualify as “rents from real property” for purposes of satisfying the gross income tests for a REIT only if several conditions are met:\n•\nThe amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although rents generally will not be excluded merely because they are based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales.\n•\nRents received from a tenant will not qualify as rents from real property if the REIT, or an owner of 10% or more of the REIT, also directly or constructively owns 10% or more of the tenant, unless the tenant is our taxable REIT subsidiary and certain other requirements are met with respect to the real property being rented.\n•\nIf rent attributable to personal property leased in connection with a lease of real property is greater than 15% of the total rent received under the lease, then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as “rents from real property.”\n14\n•\nFor rents to qualify as rents from real property, we generally must not furnish or render services to tenants, other than through a taxable REIT subsidiary or an “independent contractor” from whom we derive no income, except that we may directly provide services that are usually or customarily rendered in the geographic area in which the property is located in connection with the rental of real property for occupancy only or are not otherwise considered rendered to the occupant for his convenience.\n•\nWe may lease “qualified health care properties” on an arm’s-length basis to a taxable REIT subsidiary if the property is operated on behalf of such subsidiary by a person who qualifies as an “independent contractor” and who is, or is related to a person who is, actively engaged in the trade or business of operating health care facilities for any person unrelated to us or our taxable REIT subsidiary (such person, an “eligible independent contractor”). If this is the case, the rent that the REIT receives from the taxable REIT subsidiary generally will be treated as “rents from real property.” A “qualified health care property” includes any real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility that extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients and is operated by a provider of such services that is eligible for participation in the Medicare program with respect to such facility.\nA REIT is permitted to render a de minimis amount of impermissible services to tenants and still treat amounts received with respect to that property as rent from real property. The amount received or accrued by the REIT during the taxable year for the impermissible services with respect to a property may not exceed 1% of all amounts received or accrued by the REIT directly or indirectly from the property. The amount received for any service or management operation for this purpose shall be deemed to be not less than 150% of the direct cost of the REIT in furnishing or rendering the service or providing the management or operation. Furthermore, impermissible services may be furnished to tenants by a taxable REIT subsidiary subject to certain conditions, which would permit us to still treat rents received with respect to the property as rent from real property.\nThe term “interest” generally does not include any amount if the determination of the amount depends in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person, although an amount generally will not be excluded from the term “interest” solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage of receipts or sales.\nIf we fail to satisfy one or both of the 75% or 95% gross income tests for any taxable year, we may nevertheless qualify as a REIT for such year if we are eligible for certain relief provisions provided by the Internal Revenue Code. These relief provisions generally will be available if (1) following our identification of the failure, we file a schedule for such taxable year describing each item of our gross income, and (2) the failure to meet such tests was due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions. If these relief provisions apply, a 100% tax is imposed on an amount equal to (1) the gross income attributable to (i) 75% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 75% income test and (ii) 95% of our gross income over the amount of qualifying gross income for purposes of the 95% income test, multiplied by (2) a fraction intended to reflect our profitability. The Secretary of the Treasury is given broad authority to determine whether particular items of income or gain qualify under the 75% and 95% gross income tests and to exclude items from the measure of gross income for such purposes.\nAsset Tests\nWithin 30 days after the close of each quarter of our taxable year, we must also satisfy several tests relating to the nature and diversification of our assets determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. At least 75% of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets (including interests in real property, interests in mortgages on real property or on interests in real property, shares in other REITs and debt instruments issued by publicly offered REITs), cash, cash items (including receivables arising in the ordinary course of our operation), government securities and qualified temporary investments. Although the remaining 25% of our assets generally may be invested without restriction, we are prohibited from owning securities representing more than 10% of either the vote (the “10% vote test”) or value (the “10% value test”) of the outstanding securities of any issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary, another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Further, no more than 20% of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable REIT subsidiaries (the “20% asset test”) and no more than 5% of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of any non-governmental issuer other than a qualified REIT subsidiary (the “5% asset test”), another REIT or a taxable REIT subsidiary. Each of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test and the 20% and 5% asset tests must be satisfied at the end of each quarter. There are special rules which provide relief if the value-related tests are not satisfied due to changes in the value of the assets of a REIT.\nCertain items are excluded from the 10% value test, including: (1) straight debt securities meeting certain requirements; (2) any loan to an individual or an estate; (3) any rental agreement described in Section 467 of the Internal Revenue Code, other than with a “related person”; (4) any obligation to pay rents from real property; (5) certain securities issued by a state or any subdivision thereof, the District of Columbia, a foreign government, or any political subdivision thereof, or the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; (6) any security issued by a REIT; and (7) any other arrangement that, as determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, is excepted from the definition of security (“excluded securities”). If a REIT, or its taxable REIT subsidiary, holds (1) straight debt securities of a corporate or partnership issuer and (2) securities of such issuer that are not excluded securities and\n15\nhave an aggregate value greater than 1% of such issuer’s outstanding securities, the straight debt securities will be included in the 10% value test.\nA REIT’s interest as a partner in a partnership is not treated as a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test to securities issued by the partnership. Further, any debt instrument issued by a partnership that is not an excluded security will not be a security for purposes of applying the 10% value test (1) to the extent of the REIT’s interest as a partner in the partnership or (2) if at least 75% of the partnership’s gross income (excluding gross income from prohibited transactions) would qualify for the 75% gross income test. For purposes of the 10% value test, a REIT’s interest in a partnership’s assets is determined by the REIT’s proportionate interest in any securities issued by the partnership (other than the excluded securities described in the preceding paragraph).\nIf a REIT or its “qualified business unit” uses a foreign currency as its functional currency, the term “cash” includes such foreign currency, but only to the extent such foreign currency is (i) held for use in the normal course of the activities of the REIT or “qualified business unit” which give rise to items of income or gain that are included in the 95% and 75% gross income tests or are directly related to acquiring or holding assets qualifying under the 75% asset test, and (ii) not held in connection with dealing or engaging in substantial and regular trading in securities.\nWith respect to corrections of failures as to violations of the 10% vote test, the 10% value test or the 5% asset test, a REIT may avoid disqualification as a REIT by disposing of sufficient assets to cure a violation due to the ownership of assets that do not exceed the lesser of 1% of the REIT’s assets at the end of the relevant quarter or $10,000,000, provided that the disposition occurs within six months following the last day of the quarter in which the REIT first identified the assets. For violations of any of the REIT asset tests due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that exceed the thresholds described in the preceding sentence, a REIT can avoid disqualification as a REIT after the close of a taxable quarter by taking certain steps, including disposition of sufficient assets within the six month period described above to meet the applicable asset test, paying a tax equal to the greater of $50,000 or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non-qualifying assets during the period of time that the assets were held as non-qualifying assets and filing a schedule with the Internal Revenue Service that describes the non-qualifying assets.\nInvestments in Taxable REIT Subsidiaries\nREITs may own more than 10% of the voting power and value of securities in taxable REIT subsidiaries. Unlike a qualified REIT subsidiary, other disregarded entity or partnership, the income and assets of a taxable REIT subsidiary are not attributable to the REIT for purposes of satisfying the income and asset ownership requirements applicable to REIT qualification. We and any taxable corporate entity in which we own an interest are allowed to jointly elect to treat such entity as a “taxable REIT subsidiary.”\nCertain of our subsidiaries have elected taxable REIT subsidiary status. Taxable REIT subsidiaries are subject to full corporate level U.S. federal taxation on their earnings but are permitted to engage in certain types of activities that cannot be performed directly by REITs without jeopardizing their REIT status. Our taxable REIT subsidiaries will attempt to minimize the amount of these taxes, but there can be no assurance whether or the extent to which measures taken to minimize taxes will be successful. To the extent our taxable REIT subsidiaries are required to pay U.S. federal, state or local taxes, the cash available for distribution as dividends to us from our taxable REIT subsidiaries will be reduced.\nThe Internal Revenue Service may redetermine amounts from transactions between a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiary where there is a lack of arm’s-length dealing between the parties. Any taxable income allocated to, or deductible expenses allocated away, from a taxable REIT subsidiary would increase its tax liability. Further, certain amounts from certain transactions involving a REIT and its taxable REIT subsidiaries could be subject to a 100% tax if not conducted on an arm’s length basis. Additional taxable REIT subsidiary elections may be made in the future for additional entities in which we obtain an interest.\nAnnual Distribution Requirements\nIn order to avoid being taxed as a regular corporation, we are required to make distributions (other than capital gain distributions) to our stockholders which qualify for the dividends paid deduction in an amount at least equal to (1) the sum of (i) 90% of our “REIT taxable income” (computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain) and (ii) 90% of the after-tax net income, if any, from foreclosure property, minus (2) a portion of certain items of non-cash income. These distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate, or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for that year and if paid on or before the first regular distribution payment after such declaration. Prior to 2014, with respect to all REITs the amount distributed could not be preferential. This means that every stockholder of the class of stock to which a distribution is made must be treated the same as every other stockholder of that class, and no class of stock may be treated otherwise than in accordance with its dividend rights as a class (the “preferential dividend rule”). Beginning in tax years after 2014, the preferential dividend rule no longer applies to publicly offered REITs, however, the rule is still applicable to other entities taxed as REITs, which would include several of our subsidiaries. To the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least 90%, but less than 100%, of our “REIT taxable income,” as adjusted, we will be subject to tax on the undistributed amount at regular corporate tax rates. As discussed above, we may be subject to an excise tax if we fail to meet certain other distribution requirements. We believe we have satisfied the annual distribution requirements for the year of our initial REIT election and each year thereafter through the\n16\nyear ended December 31, 2021. Although we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy these annual distribution requirements for subsequent years, economic, market, legal, tax or other factors could limit our ability to meet those requirements. See “Item 1A - Risk Factors.”\nIt is also possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement, or to distribute such greater amount as may be necessary to avoid income and excise taxation, due to, among other things, (1) timing differences between (i) the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and (ii) the inclusion of income and deduction of expenses in arriving at our taxable income, or (2) the payment of severance benefits that may not be deductible to us. In the event that timing differences occur, we may find it necessary to arrange for borrowings or, if possible, pay dividends in the form of taxable stock dividends in order to meet the distribution requirement.\nUnder certain circumstances, including in the event of a deficiency determined by the Internal Revenue Service, we may be able to rectify a resulting failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying “deficiency dividends” to stockholders in a later year, which may be included in our deduction for distributions paid for the earlier year. Thus, we may be able to avoid being disqualified as a REIT and/or taxed on amounts distributed as deficiency dividends; however, we will be required to pay applicable penalties and interest based upon the amount of any deduction taken for deficiency dividend distributions.\nFailure to Qualify as a REIT\nIf we fail to qualify for taxation as a REIT in any taxable year, we will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates. Distributions to stockholders in any year in which we fail to qualify as a REIT will not be deductible nor will any particular amount of distributions be required to be made in any year. All distributions to stockholders will be taxable as dividends to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions and, subject to certain limitations, will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporate stockholders. Unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions, we also will be disqualified from taxation as a REIT for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost. It is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to statutory relief. Failure to qualify for even one year could result in our need to incur indebtedness or liquidate investments in order to pay potentially significant resulting tax liabilities.\nIn addition to the relief described above under “Income Tests” and “Asset Tests,” relief is available in the event that we violate a provision of the Internal Revenue Code that would result in our failure to qualify as a REIT if: (1) the violation is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect; (2) we pay a penalty of $50,000 for each failure to satisfy the provision; and (3) the violation does not include a violation described under “Income Tests” or “Asset Tests” above. It is not now possible to determine the circumstances under which we may be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Our Stock\nTreatment of Taxable U.S. Stockholders\nThe following summary applies to you only if you are a “U.S. stockholder.” A “U.S. stockholder” is a holder of shares of stock who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is:\n•\na citizen or resident of the United States;\n•\nan entity classified as a corporation or partnership, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision of the United States, including any state;\n•\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n•\na trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.\nSo long as we qualify for taxation as a REIT, distributions on shares of our stock made out of the current or accumulated earnings and profits allocable to these distributions (and not designated as capital gain dividends) will be taxable as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes. None of these distributions will be eligible for the dividends received deduction for U.S. corporate stockholders.\nGenerally, the current maximum marginal rate of tax payable by individuals on dividends received from corporations that are subject to a corporate level of tax is 20%. Except in limited circumstances, this tax rate will not apply to dividends paid to you by us on our shares, because generally we are not subject to U.S. federal income tax on the portion of our REIT taxable income or capital gains distributed to our stockholders. The reduced maximum U.S. federal income tax rate will apply to that portion, if any, of dividends received by you with respect to our shares that are attributable to: (1) dividends received by us from non-REIT corporations or other taxable REIT subsidiaries; (2) income from the prior year with respect to which we were required to pay U.S. federal corporate income tax during the prior year (if, for example, we did not distribute 100% of our REIT taxable income for the prior year); or (3) the amount of any earnings and profits distributed by us and accumulated in a non-REIT year.\nAlthough the preferential 20% rate on qualified dividends is generally not applicable to dividends to our shareholders, the Internal Revenue Code provides for a deduction from income for individuals, trusts and estates for 20% of taxable REIT\n17\ndividends not eligible for the preferential rate, excluding capital gain dividends. This deduction is not taken into account for purposes of determining the 3.8% tax on net investment income (described below) and, unlike the preferential rate, expires after 2025.\nDistributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long-term capital gains (to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year), without regard to the period for which you held our stock. However, if you are a corporation, you may be required to treat a portion of some capital gain dividends as ordinary income.\nIf we elect to retain and pay income tax on any net capital gain and designate such amount in a timely notice to you, you would include in income, as long-term capital gain, your proportionate share of this net capital gain. You would also receive a refundable tax credit for your proportionate share of the tax paid by us on such retained capital gains, and you would have an increase in the basis of your shares of our stock in an amount equal to your includable capital gains less your share of the tax deemed paid.\nYou may not include in your U.S. federal income tax return any of our net operating losses or capital losses. U.S. federal income tax rules may also require that certain minimum tax adjustments and preferences be apportioned to you. In addition, any distribution declared by us in October, November or December of any year on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by you on December 31 of that year, provided that the distribution is actually paid by us no later than January 31 of the following year.\nWe will be treated as having sufficient earnings and profits to treat as a dividend any distribution up to the amount required to be distributed in order to avoid imposition of the 4% excise tax discussed under “General” and “Qualification as a REIT - Annual Distribution Requirements” above. As a result, you may be required to treat as taxable dividends certain distributions that would otherwise result in a tax-free return of capital. Moreover, any “deficiency dividend” will be treated as a dividend (an ordinary dividend or a capital gain dividend, as the case may be), regardless of our earnings and profits. Any other distributions in excess of current or accumulated earnings and profits will generally not be taxable to you to the extent these distributions do not exceed the adjusted tax basis of your shares of our stock. You will be required to reduce the tax basis of your shares of our stock by the amount of these distributions until the basis has been reduced to zero, after which these distributions will be taxable as capital gain, if the shares of our stock are held as capital assets. The tax basis as so reduced will be used in computing the capital gain or loss, if any, realized upon the sale of the shares of our stock. Any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares of our stock which were held for six months or less (after application of certain holding period rules) will generally be treated as a long-term capital loss to the extent you previously received capital gain distributions with respect to these shares of our stock.\nUpon the sale or exchange of any shares of our stock to or with a person other than us or a sale or exchange of all shares of our stock (whether actually or constructively owned) with us, you will generally recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in these shares of our stock. This gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if you held these shares of our stock as a capital asset.\nIf we redeem any of your shares in us, the treatment can only be determined on the basis of particular facts at the time of redemption. In general, you will recognize gain or loss (as opposed to dividend income) equal to the difference between the amount received by you in the redemption and your adjusted tax basis in your shares redeemed if such redemption: (1) results in a “complete termination” of your interest in all classes of our equity securities; (2) is a “substantially disproportionate redemption”; or (3) is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to you. In applying these tests, you must take into account your ownership of all classes of our equity securities (e.g., common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares and warrants). You also must take into account any equity securities that are considered to be constructively owned by you.\nIf, as a result of a redemption by us of your shares, you no longer own (either actually or constructively) any of our equity securities or only own (actually and constructively) an insubstantial percentage of our equity securities, then it is probable that the redemption of your shares would be considered “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” and, thus, would result in gain or loss to you. However, whether a distribution is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” depends on all of the facts and circumstances, and if you rely on any of these tests at the time of redemption, you should consult your tax advisor to determine their application to the particular situation.\nGenerally, if the redemption does not meet the tests described above, then the proceeds received by you from the redemption of your shares will be treated as a distribution taxable as a dividend to the extent of the allocable portion of current or accumulated earnings and profits. If the redemption is taxed as a dividend, your adjusted tax basis in the redeemed shares will be transferred to any other shareholdings in us that you own. If you own no other shareholdings in us, under certain circumstances, such basis may be transferred to a related person, or it may be lost entirely.\nGain from the sale or exchange of our shares held for more than one year is generally taxed at a maximum long-term capital gain rate of 20% in the case of stockholders who are individuals and 21% in the case of stockholders that are corporations.  Pursuant to Internal Revenue Service guidance, we may classify portions of our capital gain dividends as eligible for specific treatment provided under the Internal Revenue Code, which, depending on the nature of the capital gains, may result in taxation of such portions at rates of either 20% or 25%. Capital losses recognized by a stockholder upon the disposition of our shares\n18\nheld for more than one year at the time of disposition will be considered long-term capital losses. The deduction for capital losses is subject to limitations.\nAn additional tax of 3.8% generally will be imposed on the “net investment income” of U.S. stockholders who meet certain requirements and are individuals, estates or certain trusts. Among other items, “net investment income” generally includes gross income from dividends and net gain attributable to the disposition of certain property, such as shares of our common stock or warrants. In the case of individuals, this tax will only apply to the extent such individual’s modified adjusted gross income exceeds $200,000 ($250,000 for married couples filing a joint return and surviving spouses, and $125,000 for married individuals filing a separate return). U.S. stockholders should consult their tax advisors regarding the possible applicability of this additional tax in their particular circumstances.\nTreatment of Tax-Exempt U.S. Stockholders\nTax-exempt entities, including qualified employee pension and profit sharing trusts and individual retirement accounts (“Exempt Organizations”), generally are exempt from U.S. federal income taxation. However, they are subject to taxation on their unrelated business taxable income (“UBTI”). The Internal Revenue Service has issued a published revenue ruling that dividend distributions from a REIT to an exempt employee pension trust do not constitute UBTI, provided that the shares of the REIT are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the exempt employee pension trust. Based on this ruling, amounts distributed by us to Exempt Organizations generally should not constitute UBTI. However, if an Exempt Organization finances its acquisition of the shares of our stock with debt, a portion of its income from us will constitute UBTI pursuant to the “debt financed property” rules. Likewise, a portion of the Exempt Organization’s income from us would constitute UBTI if we held a residual interest in a real estate mortgage investment conduit. A tax-exempt U.S. stockholder that is subject to tax on its UBTI will be required to segregate its taxable income and loss for each unrelated trade or business activity for purposes of determining its UBTI.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nUnder certain circumstances, you may be subject to backup withholding at applicable rates on payments made with respect to, or cash proceeds of a sale or exchange of, shares of our stock. Backup withholding will apply only if you: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.\nBackup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients, such as corporations and tax-exempt organizations. You should consult with a tax advisor regarding qualification for exemption from backup withholding, and the procedure for obtaining an exemption. Backup withholding is not an additional tax. Rather, the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a stockholder will be allowed as a credit against such stockholder’s U.S. federal income tax liability and may entitle such stockholder to a refund, provided that the required information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service.\nTaxation of Foreign Stockholders\nThe following summary applies to you only if you are a foreign person. A “foreign person” is a holder of shares of stock who, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, is not a U.S. stockholder. The U.S. federal taxation of foreign persons is a highly complex matter that may be affected by many considerations.\nExcept as discussed below, distributions to you of cash generated by our real estate operations in the form of ordinary dividends, but not by the sale or exchange of our capital assets, generally will be subject to U.S. withholding tax at a rate of 30%, unless an applicable tax treaty reduces that tax and you file with us the required form evidencing the lower rate.\nIn general, you will be subject to U.S. federal income tax on a graduated rate basis rather than withholding with respect to your investment in our stock if such investment is “effectively connected” with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. A corporate foreign stockholder that receives income that is, or is treated as, effectively connected with a United States trade or business may also be subject to the branch profits tax, which is payable in addition to regular United States corporate income tax. The following discussion will apply to foreign stockholders whose investment in us is not so effectively connected. We expect to withhold United States income tax, as described below, on the gross amount of any distributions paid to you unless (1) you file an Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI with us claiming that the distribution is “effectively connected” or (2) certain other exceptions apply.\nDistributions by us that are attributable to gain from the sale or exchange of a United States real property interest will be taxed to you under the Foreign Investment in Real Property Tax Act of 1980 (“FIRPTA”) as if these distributions were gains “effectively connected” with a United States trade or business. Accordingly, you will be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to a U.S. stockholder on these amounts, subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax and a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals. Distributions subject to FIRPTA may also be subject to a branch profits tax in the hands of a corporate foreign stockholder that is not entitled to treaty exemption. We will be required to withhold tax at a rate of 21% from distributions subject to FIRPTA. We will be required to withhold from distributions subject to FIRPTA, and remit to the Internal Revenue Service, 21% of designated capital gain dividends, or, if greater, 21% of the amount of any distributions that could be designated as capital gain dividends. In addition, if we designate prior distributions as\n19\ncapital gain dividends, subsequent distributions, up to the amount of the prior distributions not withheld against, will be treated as capital gain dividends for purposes of withholding.\nAny capital gain dividend with respect to any class of stock that is “regularly traded” on an established securities market will be treated as an ordinary dividend if the foreign stockholder did not own more than 10% of such class of stock at any time during the taxable year. Foreign stockholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on U.S. federal income tax returns and all distributions received by such stockholders treated as dividends for U.S. federal income tax purposes (including any such capital gain dividends) will be subject to a 30% U.S. withholding tax (unless reduced under an applicable income tax treaty) as discussed above. In addition, the branch profits tax will not apply to such distributions.\nUnless our shares constitute a “United States real property interest” within the meaning of FIRPTA or are effectively connected with a U.S. trade or business, a sale of our shares by you generally will not be subject to United States taxation. Even if our shares were to constitute a “United States real property interest,” non-U.S. stockholders that are “qualified foreign pension funds” (or are owned by a qualified foreign pension fund) meeting certain requirements may be exempt from FIRPTA withholding on the sale or disposition of our shares. Our shares will not constitute a United States real property interest if we qualify as a “domestically controlled REIT.” We believe that we qualify as and expect to continue to qualify as a domestically controlled REIT. A domestically controlled REIT is a REIT in which at all times during a specified testing period less than 50% in value of its shares is held directly or indirectly by foreign stockholders. Generally, we are permitted to assume that holders of less than 5% of our shares at all times during a specified testing period are U.S. persons. However, if you are a nonresident alien individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply, you will be subject to a 30% tax on such capital gains. In any event, a purchaser of our shares from you will not be required under FIRPTA to withhold on the purchase price if the purchased shares are “regularly traded” on an established securities market or if we are a domestically controlled REIT. Otherwise, under FIRPTA, the purchaser may be required to withhold 15% of the purchase price and remit such amount to the Internal Revenue Service.\nBackup withholding tax and information reporting will generally not apply to distributions paid to you outside the United States that are treated as: (1) dividends to which the 30% or lower treaty rate withholding tax discussed above applies; (2) capital gains dividends; or (3) distributions attributable to gain from the sale or exchange by us of U.S. real property interests. Payment of the proceeds of a sale of stock within the United States or conducted through certain U.S. related financial intermediaries is subject to both backup withholding and information reporting unless the beneficial owner certifies under penalties of perjury that he or she is not a U.S. person (and the payor does not have actual knowledge that the beneficial owner is a U.S. person) or otherwise establishes an exemption. You may obtain a refund of any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by filing the appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service.\nWithholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on certain payments to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf, including distributions in respect of shares of our stock, if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence, disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in Treasury regulations. Accordingly, the entity through which shares of our stock are held will affect the determination of whether such withholding is required. Stockholders that are otherwise eligible for an exemption from, or reduction of, U.S. withholding taxes with respect to such dividends will be required to seek a refund from the Internal Revenue Service to obtain the benefit of such exemption or reduction. Additional requirements and conditions may be imposed pursuant to an intergovernmental agreement, if and when entered into, between the United States and such institution’s home jurisdiction. We will not pay any additional amounts to any stockholders in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of Treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances.\nU.S. Federal Income Taxation of Holders of Depositary Shares\nOwners of our depositary shares will be treated as if you were owners of the series of preferred stock represented by the depositary shares. Thus, you will be required to take into account the income and deductions to which you would be entitled if you were a holder of the underlying series of preferred stock.\nConversion or Exchange of Shares for Preferred Stock\nNo gain or loss will be recognized upon the withdrawal of preferred stock in exchange for depositary shares and the tax basis of each share of preferred stock will, upon exchange, be the same as the aggregate tax basis of the depositary shares exchanged. If you held your depositary shares as a capital asset at the time of the exchange for shares of preferred stock, the holding period for your shares of preferred stock will include the period during which you owned the depositary shares.\nU.S. Federal Income and Estate Taxation of Holders of Our Debt Securities\nThe following is a general summary of the U.S. federal income tax consequences and, in the case that you are a holder that is a non-U.S. holder, as defined below, the U.S. federal estate tax consequences, of purchasing, owning and disposing of debt securities periodically offered under one or more indentures (the “notes”). This summary assumes that you hold the notes as capital assets. This summary applies to you only if you are the initial holder of the notes and you acquire the notes for a price\n20\nequal to the issue price of the notes. The issue price of the notes is the first price at which a substantial amount of the notes is sold other than to bond houses, brokers or similar persons or organizations acting in the capacity of underwriters, placement agents or wholesalers. In addition, this summary does not consider any foreign, state, local or other tax laws that may be applicable to us or a purchaser of the notes.\nU.S. Holders\nThe following summary applies to you only if you are a U.S. holder, as defined below.\nDefinition of a U.S. Holder\nA “U.S. holder” is a beneficial owner of a note or notes that is for U.S. federal income tax purposes:\n•\na citizen or resident of the United States;\n•\na corporation, partnership or other entity classified as a corporation or partnership for these purposes, created or organized in or under the laws of the United States or of any political subdivision of the United States, including any state;\n•\nan estate, the income of which is subject to U.S. federal income taxation regardless of its source; or\n•\na trust, if, in general, a U.S. court is able to exercise primary supervision over the trust’s administration and one or more U.S. persons, within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code, has the authority to control all of the trust’s substantial decisions.\nPayments of Interest\nStated interest on the notes generally will be taxed as ordinary interest income from domestic sources at the time it is paid or accrues in accordance with your method of accounting for tax purposes.\nSale, Exchange or Other Disposition of Notes\nThe adjusted tax basis in your note will generally be your cost. You generally will recognize taxable gain or loss when you sell or otherwise dispose of your notes equal to the difference, if any, between:\n•\nthe amount realized on the sale or other disposition, less any amount attributable to any accrued interest, which will be taxable in the manner described under “Payments of Interest” above; and\n•\nyour adjusted tax basis in the notes.\nYour gain or loss generally will be capital gain or loss. This capital gain or loss will be long-term capital gain or loss if at the time of the sale or other disposition you have held the notes for more than one year. Subject to limited exceptions, your capital losses cannot be used to offset your ordinary income (except in the case of individuals, who may offset up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year).\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nIn general, “backup withholding” may apply to any payments made to you of principal and interest on your note, and to the payment of the proceeds of a sale or other disposition of your note before maturity, if you are a non-corporate U.S. holder and: (1) fail to provide a correct taxpayer identification number, which if you are an individual, is ordinarily your social security number; (2) furnish an incorrect taxpayer identification number; (3) are notified by the Internal Revenue Service that you have failed to properly report payments of interest or dividends; or (4) fail to certify, under penalties of perjury, that you have furnished a correct taxpayer identification number and that the Internal Revenue Service has not notified you that you are subject to backup withholding.\nThe amount of any reportable payments, including interest, made to you (unless you are an exempt recipient) and the amount of tax withheld, if any, with respect to such payments will be reported to you and to the Internal Revenue Service for each calendar year. You should consult your tax advisor regarding your qualification for an exemption from backup withholding and the procedures for obtaining such an exemption, if applicable. The backup withholding tax is not an additional tax and will be credited against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided that correct information is provided to the Internal Revenue Service.\nNon-U.S. Holders\nThe following summary applies to you if you are a beneficial owner of a note and are not a U.S. holder, as defined above (a “non-U.S. holder”).\nSpecial rules may apply to certain non-U.S. holders such as “controlled foreign corporations,” “passive foreign investment companies” and “foreign personal holding companies.” Such entities are encouraged to consult their tax advisors to determine the U.S. federal, state, local and other tax consequences that may be relevant to them.\nU.S. Federal Withholding Tax\nSubject to the discussion below, U.S. federal withholding tax will not apply to payments by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, of principal and interest on your notes under the “portfolio interest” exception of the Internal Revenue Code, provided that:\n21\n•\nyou do not, directly or indirectly, actually or constructively, own 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of our stock entitled to vote;\n•\nyou are not (1) a controlled foreign corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes that is related, directly or indirectly, to us through sufficient stock ownership, as provided in the Internal Revenue Code, or (2) a bank receiving interest described in Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code;\n•\nsuch interest is not effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business; and\n•\nyou provide a signed written statement, under penalties of perjury, which can reliably be related to you, certifying that you are not a U.S. person within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code and providing your name and address to us or our paying agent; or\n•\na securities clearing organization, bank or other financial institution that holds customers’ securities in the ordinary course of its trade or business and holds your notes on your behalf and that certifies to us or our paying agent under penalties of perjury that it, or the bank or financial institution between it and you, has received from you your signed, written statement and provides us or our paying agent with a copy of such statement.\nTreasury regulations provide that:\n•\nif you are a foreign partnership, the certification requirement will generally apply to your partners, and you will be required to provide certain information;\n•\nif you are a foreign trust, the certification requirement will generally be applied to you or your beneficial owners depending on whether you are a “foreign complex trust,” “foreign simple trust,” or “foreign grantor trust” as defined in the Treasury regulations; and\n•\nlook-through rules will apply for tiered partnerships, foreign simple trusts and foreign grantor trusts.\nIf you are a foreign partnership or a foreign trust, you should consult your own tax advisor regarding your status under these Treasury regulations and the certification requirements applicable to you.\nIf you cannot satisfy the portfolio interest requirements described above, payments of interest will be subject to the 30% United States withholding tax, unless you provide us with a properly executed (1) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN claiming an exemption from or reduction in withholding under the benefit of an applicable treaty or (2) Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI stating that interest paid on the note is not subject to withholding tax because it is effectively connected with your conduct of a trade or business in the United States. Alternative documentation may be applicable in certain circumstances.\nIf you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States and interest on a note is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, you will be required to pay U.S. federal income tax on that interest on a net income basis (although you will be exempt from the 30% withholding tax provided the certification requirement described above is met) in the same manner as if you were a U.S. person, except as otherwise provided by an applicable tax treaty. If you are a foreign corporation, you may be required to pay a branch profits tax on the earnings and profits that are effectively connected to the conduct of your trade or business in the United States.\nWithholding tax at a rate of 30% will be imposed on payments of interest (including original issue discount) to you or certain foreign financial institutions (including investment funds) and other non-US persons receiving payments on your behalf if you or such institutions fail to comply with certain due diligence, disclosure and reporting rules, as set forth in Treasury regulations. We will not pay any additional amounts to any holders of our debt instruments in respect of any amounts withheld. You are encouraged to consult with your tax advisor regarding U.S. withholding taxes and the application of the relevant Treasury regulations in light of your particular circumstances.\nSale, Exchange or other Disposition of Notes\nYou generally will not have to pay U.S. federal income tax on any gain or income realized from the sale, redemption, retirement at maturity or other disposition of your notes, unless:\n•\nin the case of gain, you are an individual who is present in the United States for 183 days or more during the taxable year of the sale or other disposition of your notes, and specific other conditions are met;\n•\nyou are subject to tax provisions applicable to certain United States expatriates; or\n•\nthe gain is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.\nIf you are engaged in a trade or business in the United States, and gain with respect to your notes is effectively connected with the conduct of that trade or business, you generally will be subject to U.S. income tax on a net basis on the gain. In addition, if you are a foreign corporation, you may be subject to a branch profits tax on your effectively connected earnings and profits for the taxable year, as adjusted for certain items.\n22\nU.S. Federal Estate Tax.\nIf you are an individual and are not a U.S. citizen or a resident of the United States, as specially defined for U.S. federal estate tax purposes, at the time of your death, your notes will generally not be subject to the U.S. federal estate tax, unless, at the time of your death (1) you owned actually or constructively 10% or more of the total combined voting power of all our classes of stock entitled to vote, or (2) interest on the notes is effectively connected with your conduct of a U.S. trade or business.\nBackup Withholding and Information Reporting\nBackup withholding will not apply to payments of principal or interest made by us or our paying agent, in its capacity as such, to you if you have provided the required certification that you are a non-U.S. holder as described in “U.S. Federal Withholding Tax” above, and provided that neither we nor our paying agent have actual knowledge that you are a U.S. holder, as described in “U.S. Holders” above. We or our paying agent may, however, report payments of interest on the notes.\nThe gross proceeds from the disposition of your notes may be subject to information reporting and backup withholding tax. If you sell your notes outside the United States through a non-U.S. office of a non-U.S. broker and the sales proceeds are paid to you outside the United States, then the U.S. backup withholding and information reporting requirements generally will not apply to that payment. However, U.S. information reporting, but not backup withholding, will apply to a payment of sales proceeds, even if that payment is made outside the United States, if you sell your notes through a non-U.S. office of a broker that has certain connections with the United States.\nYou should consult your own tax advisor regarding application of backup withholding in your particular circumstance and the availability of and procedure for obtaining an exemption from backup withholding. Any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules from a payment to you will be allowed as a refund or credit against your U.S. federal income tax liability, provided the required information is furnished to the Internal Revenue Service.\nU.S. Federal Income of Holders of Our Warrants\nExercise of Warrants\nYou will not generally recognize gain or loss upon the exercise of a warrant. Your basis in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will be equal to the sum of your adjusted tax basis in the warrant and the exercise price paid. Your holding period in the debt securities, preferred stock, depositary shares or common stock, as the case may be, received upon the exercise of the warrant will not include the period during which the warrant was held by you.\nExpiration of Warrants\nUpon the expiration of a warrant, you will generally recognize a capital loss in an amount equal to your adjusted tax basis in the warrant.\nSale or Exchange of Warrants\nUpon the sale or exchange of a warrant to a person other than us, you will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized on the sale or exchange and your adjusted tax basis in the warrant. Such gain or loss will generally be capital gain or loss and will be long-term capital gain or loss if the warrant was held for more than one year. Upon the sale of the warrant to us, the Internal Revenue Service may argue that you should recognize ordinary income on the sale. You are advised to consult your own tax advisors as to the consequences of a sale of a warrant to us.\nPotential Legislation or Other Actions Affecting Tax Consequences\nCurrent and prospective securities holders should recognize that the present U.S. federal income tax treatment of an investment in us may be modified by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time and that any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made. The rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process and by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of the Treasury, resulting in revisions of regulations and revised interpretations of established concepts as well as statutory changes. Revisions in U.S. federal tax laws and interpretations of these laws could adversely affect the tax consequences of an investment in us.\nState, Local and Foreign Taxes\nWe, and holders of our debt and equity securities, may be subject to state, local or foreign taxation in various jurisdictions, including those in which we or they transact business, own property or reside. It should be noted that we own properties located in a number of state, local and foreign jurisdictions, and may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions. The state, local or foreign tax treatment of us and holders of our debt and equity securities may not conform to the U.S. federal income tax consequences discussed above. Consequently, you are urged to consult your advisor regarding the application and effect of state, local and foreign tax laws with respect to any investment in our securities.\nBecause the U.S. generally maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international tax norms that determine each country’s jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from the Company, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries. It is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest. Given the unpredictability of these\n23\npossible changes and their potential interdependency, it is very difficult to assess the overall effect of such potential tax changes on our earnings and cash flow, but such changes could adversely impact our financial results.\nInternet Access to Our SEC Filings\nOur annual reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and amendments to those reports, as well as our proxy statements and other materials that are filed with, or furnished to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) are made available, free of charge, on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors, as soon as reasonably practicable after they are filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

    "text": "Risk Factor Summary\nThe following summarizes the principal factors that make an investment in our company speculative or risky, all of which are more fully described in the Risk Factors section below. This summary should be read in conjunction with the Risk Factors section and should not be relied upon as an exhaustive summary of the material risks facing our business. The order of presentation is not necessarily indicative of the level of risk that each factor poses to us.\nRisks Arising from Our Business:\nOur business model and the operations of our business involve risks, including those related to:\n•\nthe effects of the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\nuncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and future stimulus or other COVID-19 relief legislation;\n•\ninvestments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties;\n•\nunknown liability exposure related to acquired properties;\n•\ncompetition for acquisitions may result in increased prices;\n•\nour joint venture partners;\n•\nSeniors Housing Operating properties operational risks;\n•\nour ability to terminate our management agreements with Seniors Housing Operating managers;\n•\noperational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures;\n•\nthe ability of operators and tenants to make payments to us;\n•\nthe impacts of severe cold and flu seasons or other widespread illnesses on occupancy;\n•\nthe insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors;\n•\nour ability to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us;\n•\nany adverse developments in the business or financial condition of Sunrise Senior Living, LLC;\n•\nany failure, inability or unwillingness by ProMedica Health System to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us;\n•\nownership of property outside the U.S.;\n•\nour ability to lease or sell properties on favorable terms;\n•\ntenant, operator and manager insurance coverage;\n•\nloss of properties owned through ground leases upon breach or termination of the ground leases;\n•\nrequirements of, or changes to governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding;\n•\ncontrols imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay;\n•\nour operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards;\n•\ndevelopment, redevelopment and construction;\n•\nlosses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change;\n•\ncosts incurred to remediate environmental contamination at our properties;\n•\nour reliance on data and technology systems and the increasing risks of cybersecurity incidents; and\n25\n•\nour dependence on key personnel.\nRisks Arising from Our Capital Structure\nOur capital structure involves exposure to risks, including those related to:\n•\nour future leverage;\n•\nthe availability of cash for distributions to stockholders;\n•\ncovenants in our debt agreements;\n•\nlimitations on our ability to access capital;\n•\nchanges affecting the availability of LIBOR;\n•\nany downgrades in our credit ratings; and\n•\nincreases in interest rates.\nRisks Arising from Our Status as a REIT\nAs a result of our status as a REIT, we are exposed to risks, including those related to:\n•\nour ability to remain qualified as a REIT;\n•\nthe ability of our subsidiaries to qualify as a REIT;\n•\nthe impact of the 90% annual distribution requirement on our liquidity and ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions;\n•\nour limited use of TRSs under the Code;\n•\nspecial requirements applicable to the lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary;\n•\ntax consequences if certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the IRS as “true leases; and\n•\nchanges in our tax rate or exposure to additional tax liabilities.\nRisks Factors\nThis section highlights significant factors, events and uncertainties that could create risk with an investment in our securities. The events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. These risk factors do not identify all risks that we face: our operations could also be affected by factors, events or uncertainties that are not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider to present significant risks to our operations. We group these risk factors into three categories:\n•\nRisks arising from our business;\n•\nRisks arising from our capital structure; and\n•\nRisks arising from our status as a REIT.\nRisks Arising from Our Business\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may continue to adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe are unable to accurately predict the full impact that the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and cash flows due to numerous factors that are not within our control. These factors include the duration and severity of the outbreak, including the impact of new variants; the continued deployment of vaccines and boosters; the effectiveness of vaccines and boosters over time and against new variants; public health measures, such as business closures and stay-at-home orders, and other actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the availability of federal, state, local or non-U.S. funding programs; general economic disruption and uncertainty in key markets and financial market volatility; and the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on general macroeconomic conditions and the pace of recovery when the pandemic subsides.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has subjected our business, operations and financial condition to a number of risks, including but not limited to those discussed below:\n•\nRisks Related to Revenue:\nOur revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy. Our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio has experienced a decline in spot occupancy from 85.8% at February 29, 2020 to 76.2% at December 31, 2020 and 77.7% at December 31, 2021. Although the ongoing impact of the pandemic, including new variants, and vaccine and booster deployment on occupancy remain uncertain, occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could further decrease, including as a result of new variants or decreases in vaccine effectiveness over time. Such a decrease could affect the net operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual payments to us. In addition,\n26\nalthough we collected virtually all rent due in the fourth quarter of 2021, rental income in our Outpatient Medical segment may decrease if our tenants do not renew leases or do not make timely or full lease payments as a result of medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures or decisions by patients to delay treatments. As a result of the financial impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operators and tenants, we may offer certain tenants concessions such as rent deferrals or rent abatements across our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical segments.\n•\nRisks Related to Operator and Tenant Financial Condition:\nIn addition to decreased revenue from tenant and operator payments, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic creates a heightened risk of tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency due to factors such as prolonged decreased occupancy, medical practice disruptions resulting from stay-at-home orders, increased health and safety and labor expenses or litigation resulting from developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic. See\" -\nThe insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\"\nfor more information Our ability to terminate our lease with a tenant or management agreement with an operator or manager, and relet the property to another tenant or transition to a new operator or manager may be severely limited under current conditions due to the industry and macroeconomic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and local ordinances. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, operator or manager due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic or for other reasons, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about an operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings, particularly in light of ongoing publicity related to the COVID-19 pandemic, may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Additionally, COVID-19 claims have been excluded from insurance policies resulting in uninsured claims, and there has been an increase of COVID-19 class action lawsuits filed that may result in unfavorable verdicts. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected.\n•\nRisks Related to Operations:\nAcross all of our properties, we and our operators and tenants have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties and operations, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators and tenants related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to efforts to procure PPE and supplies. Such operational costs may increase in the future based on the duration and severity of the pandemic or the introduction of additional public health regulations. In addition, operators and tenants are subject to risks arising from the unique pressures on seniors housing and medical practice employees during the COVID-19 pandemic including labor shortages resulting from macroeconomic trends. As a result of difficult conditions and stresses related to the COVID-19 pandemic, employee morale and productivity may suffer and additional pay, such as hazard pay, may not be sufficient to retain key operator and tenant employees. In addition, our operations or those of our operators or tenants may be adversely impacted if a significant number of our employees or those of our operators or tenants contract COVID-19. Although we continue to undertake extensive efforts to ensure the safety of our employees and residents and to provide operator and tenant support in this regard, the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our facilities could result in additional operational costs and reputational and litigation risk to us and our operators and tenants. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, operator and tenant cost of insurance is expected to increase and such insurance may not cover certain claims related to COVID-19. Our exposure to COVID-19 related litigation risk may be increased if the operators or tenants of the relevant facilities are subject to bankruptcy or insolvency. In addition, to varying degrees during the course of the pandemic, we have experienced increased operational challenges and costs resulting from logistical challenges such as supply chain interruptions, business closures and restrictions on the movement of people. In response to stay-at-home orders and to support the health and well-being of our employees, many of our employees are currently working remote or hybrid schedules. The effects of such work arrangements for an extended period of time could impact employee productivity and morale and introduce additional operational risk, including but not limited to cybersecurity risks.\n•\nRisks Related to Liquidity:\nIf our access to capital is restricted or our borrowing costs increase as a result of developments in financial markets relating to the pandemic, our operations and financial condition could be adversely impacted. In addition, a prolonged period of decreased revenue may adversely affect our financial condition and long-term growth prospects and there can also be no assurance that we will not face credit rating downgrades. Future downgrades could adversely affect our cost of capital, liquidity, competitive position and access to capital markets.\nThe events and consequences discussed in these risk factors could, in circumstances we may not be able to accurately predict, recognize or control, have a material adverse effect on our business, growth, reputation, prospects, financial condition, operating results, cash flows, liquidity, ability to pay dividends and stock price. As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to adversely affect our operating and financial results, it may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the risk factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n27\nThere remains uncertainty regarding the implementation and impact of the CARES Act and any future stimulus or other COVID-19 relief legislation. There can be no assurance as to the amount of financial assistance we and our operators will receive or that we will be able to comply with the terms and conditions to keep such assistance.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act (\"CARES Act\") and the Paycheck Protection Program and Health Care Enhancement Act (\"PPPHCE Act\"), signed into law on March 20, 2020, and April 24, 2020, respectively, authorized $175 billion in funding to be distributed to healthcare providers, including assisted living facilities. These funds, distributed through the Provider Relief Fund and administered by the Department of Health and Human Services, are required to be used to prevent, prepare for and respond to COVID-19 and reimburse expenses or lost revenues attributable the COVID-19 pandemic. Although these distributions are not subject to repayment, attestation and compliance with certain terms and conditions including detailed reporting and auditing are required. Any funds that are ultimately received and retained by us are not expected to fully offset the losses incurred in our senior living portfolio that are attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received government grants under the CARES Act primarily to cover increased expenses and lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as under similar programs in the U.K. and Canada. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recognized $102,575,000 and $34,941,000, respectively, of government grant income. We have completed applications for grant income under Phase 4 of the Provider Relief Fund and expect to receive additional funding during 2022. However, there can be no assurances that all of our applications will be approved or that additional funds will ultimately be received in full or in part.\nOur investments in and acquisitions of health care and seniors housing properties may be unsuccessful or fail to meet our expectations\nSome of our acquisitions may not prove to be successful. We could encounter unanticipated difficulties and expenditures relating to any acquired properties, including contingent liabilities, and acquired properties might require significant management attention that would otherwise be devoted to our ongoing business. If we agree to provide construction funding to an operator/tenant and the project is not completed, we may need to take steps to ensure completion of the project. Such expenditures may negatively affect our results of operations. Investments in and acquisitions of seniors housing and health care properties entail risks associated with real estate investments generally, including risks that the investment will not achieve expected returns, that the cost estimates for necessary property improvements will prove inaccurate or that the tenant, operator or manager will fail to meet performance expectations. Furthermore, there can be no assurance that our anticipated acquisitions and investments, the completion of which is subject to various conditions, will be consummated in accordance with anticipated timing, on anticipated terms, or at all. We may be unable to obtain or assume financing for acquisitions on favorable terms or at all. Health care properties are often highly customizable and the development or redevelopment of such properties may require costly tenant-specific improvements. We have experienced delays and disruptions to property redevelopment as a result of supply chain issues and construction material and labor shortages and may experience additional or more significant such delays in the future. We also may be unable to quickly and efficiently integrate new acquisitions, particularly acquisitions of portfolios of properties, into our existing operations, and this could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Acquired properties may be located in new markets, either within or outside the United States, where we may face risks associated with a lack of market knowledge or understanding of the local economy, lack of business relationships in the area, costs associated with opening a new regional office and unfamiliarity with local governmental and permitting procedures. As a result, we cannot assure you that we will achieve the economic benefit we expect from acquisitions, investment, development and redevelopment opportunities and may lead to impairment of such assets.\nAcquired properties may expose us to unknown liability\nWe may acquire properties or invest in joint ventures that own properties subject to liabilities and without any recourse, or with only limited recourse, against the prior owners or other third parties with respect to unknown liabilities. As a result, if a liability were asserted against us based upon ownership of those properties, we might have to pay substantial sums to settle or contest it, which could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flow. Unknown liabilities with respect to acquired properties might include: liabilities for clean-up of undisclosed environmental contamination, claims by tenants, vendors or other persons against the former owners of the properties, liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business and claims for indemnification by general partners, directors and others indemnified by the former owners of the properties.\nCompetition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties\nWe may face competition for acquisition opportunities from other well-capitalized investors, including publicly traded and privately held REITs, private real estate funds, domestic and foreign financial institutions, life insurance companies, sovereign wealth funds, pension trusts, partnerships and individual investors. This competition may adversely affect us by subjecting us to the following risks: we may be unable to acquire a desired property because of competition from other well-capitalized real estate investors and, even if we are able to acquire a desired property, competition from other real estate investors may significantly increase the purchase price.\n28\nOur investments in joint ventures could be adversely affected by our lack of exclusive control over these investments, our partners’ insolvency or failure to meet their obligations, and disputes between us and our partners\nWe have entered into, and may continue in the future to enter into, partnerships or joint ventures with other persons or entities. Joint venture investments involve risks that may not be present with other methods of ownership, including the possibility that our partner might become insolvent, refuse to make capital contributions when due or otherwise fail to meet its obligations, which may result in certain liabilities to us for guarantees and other commitments; that our partner might at any time have economic or other business interests or goals that are or become inconsistent with our interests or goals; that we could become engaged in a dispute with our partner, which could require us to expend additional resources to resolve such dispute and could have an adverse impact on the operations and profitability of the joint venture; that our partner may be in a position to take action or withhold consent contrary to our instructions or requests; and that our joint venture partners may be structured differently than us for tax purposes, which could create conflicts of interest and risks to our REIT status. In some instances, we and/or our partner may have the right to trigger a buy-sell, put right or forced sale arrangement, which could cause us to sell our interest, acquire our partner’s interest or sell the underlying asset at a time when we otherwise would not have initiated such a transaction. Our ability to acquire our partner’s interest may be limited if we do not have sufficient cash, available borrowing capacity or other capital resources. In such event, we may be forced to sell our interest in the joint venture when we would otherwise prefer to retain it. On the other hand, our ability to transfer our interest in a joint venture to a third party may be restricted and the market for our interest may be limited and/or valued lower than fair market value. Joint ventures may require us to share decision-making authority with our partners, which could limit our ability to control the properties in the joint ventures. Even when we have a controlling interest, certain major decisions may require partner approval, such as the sale, acquisition or financing of a property.\nWe assume operational and legal risks with respect to our properties managed in RIDEA structures that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nWe have entered into various joint ventures that were structured under the provisions of the REIT Investment Diversification and Empowerment Act of 2007 (“RIDEA”), which permits REITs to own or partially own “qualified health care properties” in a structure through which we can participate directly in the cash flow of the properties’ operations (as compared to receiving only contractual rent payments) in compliance with REIT requirements. A “qualified health care property” includes real property and any personal property that is, or is necessary or incidental to the use of, a hospital, nursing facility, assisted living facility, congregate care facility, qualified continuing care facility, or other licensed facility which extends medical or nursing or ancillary services to patients.\nUnder a RIDEA structure, we are required to rely on our operator to manage and operate the property, including complying with laws and providing resident care. However, as the owner of the property under a RIDEA structure, we are responsible for operational and legal risks and liabilities of the property, including, but not limited to, those relating to employment matters of our operators, compliance with health care fraud and abuse and other laws, governmental reimbursement matters, compliance with federal, state, local and industry-related licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards, and litigation involving our properties or residents/patients, even though we have limited ability to control or influence our operators’ management of these risks. Further, our taxable REIT subsidiary (“TRS”) is generally required to hold the applicable health care license and enroll in the applicable government health care programs (e.g., Medicare- and Medicaid), which subjects us to potential liability under various health care regulatory laws. Penalties for failure to comply with applicable laws may include loss or suspension of licenses and certificates of need, certification or accreditation, exclusion from government health care programs (e.g., Medicare and Medicaid), administrative sanctions and civil monetary penalties. Although we have some general oversight approval rights and the right to review operational and financial reporting information, our operators are ultimately in control of the day-to-day business of the property, including clinical decision-making, and we rely on them to operate the properties in a manner that complies with applicable law.\nWe are exposed to operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that could adversely affect our revenue and operations\nWe are exposed to various operational risks with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties that may increase our costs or adversely affect our ability to generate revenues. In addition to operational challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, these risks include fluctuations in occupancy experienced during the normal course of business, Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable, and private pay rates; economic conditions; competition; federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards; the availability and increases in cost of general and professional liability insurance coverage; increases in property taxes; state regulation and rights of residents related to entrance fees; federal and state housing laws and regulations, including rent and eviction restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic; and the availability and increases in the cost of labor (as a result of unionization or otherwise). Any one or a combination of these factors may adversely affect our revenue and operations and could eventually lead to impairment of our properties.\n29\nWe have rights to terminate our management agreements with operators, in whole or with respect to specific properties under certain circumstances, and we may be unable to replace if our management agreements are terminated or not renewed\nWe are parties to long-term management agreements with our Seniors Housing Operating managers pursuant to which they provide comprehensive property management, accounting and other services with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. We have the ability to  terminate any of our management agreements upon the occurrence of certain events such as insolvency relating to such manager, and in some cases, the failure to meet specific NOI targets without curing, as well as the occurrence of other events or certain conditions.\nWe regularly monitor and review our rights and remedies under our management agreements. When determining if we will take significant action under those agreements, including terminating a manager, we consider numerous legal, contractual, regulatory, business and other relevant factors. In exercising our rights to terminate or not renew a management agreement, we would work with our existing seniors housing operators or potentially new operators to manage the properties; however, there is no assurance that we would be able to timely source a replacement or that any replacement manager would be effective. Any transition to a new manager would most likely require regulatory approval and potentially the approval of the holders of any liens on the property. The failure to replace on a timely basis, as well as the failure to receive these approvals, either at all or in a timely manner, could have an adverse effect on the properties and our revenue.\nDecreases in our operators’ or tenants' revenues or increases in our operators’ or tenants' expenses, including as a result of increased labor costs, could affect their ability to make payments to us\nWe have very limited control over the success or failure of our operators' or tenants' businesses and, at any time, an operator or tenant may experience a downturn in their business that weakens their financial condition. Our operators’ and tenants' revenues are primarily driven by occupancy, private pay rates, and Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement, if applicable. Expenses are primarily driven by the costs of labor, supplies, food, utilities, taxes, insurance and rent or debt service. Revenues from government reimbursement have, and may continue to, come under pressure due to reimbursement cuts and state budget shortfalls. Operating costs continue to increase for our operators and tenants. In particular, our operators' and tenants' businesses are vulnerable to increases in labor costs resulting from shortages of medical and non-medical staff. A number of factors may adversely affect the labor force available to our operators and tenants or labor costs, including increased industry competition, high employment levels, federal unemployment subsidies, including unemployment benefits offered in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, increased wages offered by other employers, including in other economic sectors, vaccine mandates and other government regulations. During the COVID-19 pandemic, in many geographic areas the lack of availability of specialized medical personnel, experienced senior care professionals and other workers has been a significant operating issue affecting a wide range of healthcare providers and senior care and housing facilities. Such shortages have and may continue to impact the operations of our operators and tenants, resulting in increased labor and operating costs. Continued labor shortages or cost inflation may impact our operators' and tenants' abilities to comply with minimum staffing requirements under applicable federal and state regulations. Failure to comply with these requirements can, among other things, jeopardize a facility's compliance with the conditions of participation under relevant state and federal healthcare programs. In addition, if a facility is determined to be out of compliance with these requirements, it may be subject to fines and other regulatory penalties, including the suspension of patient admissions, the termination of Medicaid participation or the suspension or revocation of licenses.\nTo the extent that any decrease in revenues and/or any increase in operating expenses result in an operator or tenant not generating enough cash to make payments to us, the credit of our operator or tenant and the value of other collateral would have to be relied upon. To the extent the value of such property is reduced, we may need to record an impairment for such asset. Furthermore, if we determine to dispose of an underperforming property, such sale may result in a loss. Any such impairment or loss on sale would negatively affect our financial results. These risks are magnified where we lease multiple properties to a single operator or tenant under a master lease, as a failure or default under a master lease would expose us to these risks across multiple properties. Although our lease agreements give us the right to exercise certain remedies in the event of default on the obligations owing to us, we may determine not to do so if we believe that enforcement of our rights would be more detrimental to our business than seeking alternative approaches.\nIncreased competition and oversupply may affect our operators’ and managers' ability to meet their obligations to us\nThe operators and managers of our properties compete on a local and regional basis with operators and managers of properties and other health care providers that provide comparable services for residents and patients, including on the basis of the scope and quality of care and services provided, reputation and financial condition, physical appearance of the properties, price, and location. In addition, in light of labor shortages for medical and non-medical workers in many geographic areas, our operators and tenants increasingly compete to attract qualified and experienced employees. Our operators and managers are expected to encounter increased competition in the future that could limit their ability to attract residents and employees or expand their businesses. In addition, we expect that there will continue to be a more than adequate inventory of seniors housing facilities. We cannot be certain that the operators of all of our facilities will be able to achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels that meet our expected yields and fulfill their obligations to us, including but not limited to the results of the COVID-19 pandemic. If our operators and managers cannot compete effectively or if there is an oversupply of facilities, their financial performance could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\n30\nA severe cold and flu season, epidemics or any other widespread illnesses could adversely affect the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties\nIn addition to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, our business and operations are exposed to risks from severe cold and flu seasons or the occurrence of epidemics or any other widespread illnesses. Our revenues and our operators' revenues are dependent on occupancy and the occupancy of our Seniors Housing Operating and Triple-net properties could significantly decrease in the event of a severe cold and flu season, an epidemic or any other widespread illness. Such a decrease could affect the operating income of our Seniors Housing Operating properties and the ability of our Triple-net operators to make payments to us. As experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic, a future flu or other pandemic could significantly increase the cost burdens faced by our operators, including if they are required to implement quarantines for residents, and adversely affect their ability to meet their obligations to us, which would have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nThe insolvency or bankruptcy of our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers and other obligors may adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition\nWe are exposed to the risk that our tenants, operators, borrowers, managers or other obligors may not be able to meet the rent, principal and interest or other payments due us, which may result in a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor bankruptcy or insolvency, or that a tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor might become subject to bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings for other reasons. Although our operating lease agreements provide us with the right to evict a tenant, demand immediate payment of rent and exercise other remedies, and our loans provide us with the right to terminate any funding obligation, demand immediate repayment of principal and unpaid interest, foreclose on the collateral and exercise other remedies, the bankruptcy and insolvency laws afford certain rights to a party that has filed for bankruptcy or reorganization. A tenant, operator, borrower, manager or other obligor in bankruptcy or subject to insolvency proceedings may be able to limit or delay our ability to collect unpaid rent in the case of a lease or to receive unpaid principal and interest in the case of a loan, and to exercise other rights and remedies. In addition, if a lease is rejected in a tenant bankruptcy, our claim against the tenant may be limited by applicable provisions of the bankruptcy law. We may be required to fund certain expenses (e.g., real estate taxes and maintenance) to preserve the value of an investment property, avoid the imposition of liens on a property and/or transition a property to a new tenant. In some instances, we have terminated our lease with a tenant and relet the property to another tenant. In some of those situations, we have provided working capital loans to and limited indemnification of the new obligor. If we cannot transition a leased property to a new tenant, we may take possession of that property, which may expose us to certain successor liabilities. Publicity about the operator's financial condition and insolvency proceedings may also negatively impact their and our reputations, decreasing customer demand and revenues. Should such events occur, our revenue and operating cash flow may be adversely affected.\nWe may not be able to timely reinvest our sale proceeds on terms acceptable to us\nFrom time to time, we will have cash available from the proceeds of sales of our securities, principal payments on our loans receivable or the sale of properties, including non-elective dispositions, under the terms of master leases or similar financial support arrangements. In order to maintain current revenues and continue generating attractive returns, we expect to reinvest these proceeds in a timely manner. We compete for real estate investments with a broad variety of potential investors, including other health care REITs, real estate partnerships, health care providers, health care lenders and other investors, including developers, banks, insurance companies, pension funds, government-sponsored entities and private equity firms, some of whom may have greater financial resources and lower costs of capital than we do. This competition for attractive investments may negatively affect our ability to make timely investments on terms acceptable to us.\nIn addition, our ability to execute on our real estate investment strategies may be temporarily disrupted during periods of financial market volatility or real estate and health care industry market uncertainty, including as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nThe properties managed by Sunrise Senior Living, LLC (“Sunrise”) account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income and any adverse developments in its business or financial condition could adversely affect us\nAs of December 31, 2021, Sunrise managed 110 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. These properties account for a significant portion of our revenues and net operating income. Under our management agreements, we rely on Sunrise’s personnel, expertise, technical resources and information systems, proprietary information, good faith and judgment to manage our Seniors Housing Operating properties efficiently and effectively. We also rely on Sunrise to set appropriate resident fees, to provide accurate property-level financial results for our properties in a timely manner and to otherwise operate them in compliance with the terms of our management agreements and all applicable laws and regulations. Any adverse developments in Sunrise’s business or financial condition could impair its ability to manage our properties efficiently and effectively, which could adversely affect our business, results of operations, and financial condition. For example, we depend on Sunrise’s ability to attract and retain skilled management personnel who are responsible for the day-to-day operations of our Seniors Housing Operating properties. A shortage of nurses or other trained personnel or general inflationary pressures may force Sunrise to enhance its pay and benefits packages to compete effectively for such personnel, but it may not be able to offset these added costs by increasing the rates charged to residents. Any increase in labor costs and other property operating expenses, any failure by Sunrise to attract and retain qualified personnel, or significant changes in Sunrise’s senior management or equity ownership\n31\ncould adversely affect the income we receive from our Seniors Housing Operating properties and have a material adverse effect on us. Also, if Sunrise experiences any significant financial, legal, accounting or regulatory difficulties, such difficulties could result in, among other things, acceleration of its indebtedness, impairment of its continued access to capital or the commencement of insolvency proceedings by or against it under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition. If we determine to sell or transition properties currently managed by Sunrise, we may experience operational challenges and/or significantly declining financial performance for those properties.\nWe depend on ProMedica Health System (\"ProMedica\") for a significant portion of our revenues and any failure, inability or unwillingness by them to satisfy obligations under their agreements with us could adversely affect us\nAs of December 31, 2021, we lease 205 properties to ProMedica under triple-net leases, which account for a significant portion of our revenues. We depend on ProMedica to pay all insurance, taxes, utilities and maintenance and repair expenses in connection with the leased properties. We cannot assure you that ProMedica will have sufficient assets, income and access to financing to enable them to make rental payments to us or to otherwise satisfy their respective obligations under our leases, and any failure, inability or unwillingness by ProMedica to do so could have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. ProMedica have also agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses, and we cannot assure you that ProMedica will have sufficient assets, income, access to financing and insurance coverage to enable them to satisfy their respective indemnification obligations. ProMedica's failure to effectively conduct their operations or to maintain and improve our properties could adversely affect their business reputations and their ability to attract and retain patients and residents in our properties, which, in turn, could adversely affect our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nOwnership of property outside the U.S. may subject us to different or greater risks than those associated with our domestic operations\nWe have operations in the U.K. and Canada which represent 11.7% and 8.9% of total Welltower revenues, respectively.  As of December 31, 2021, Revera managed 85 of our Seniors Housing Operating properties in Canada, representing a significant portion of our revenues, and also owned a controlling interest in Sunrise. International development, ownership, and operating activities involve risks that are different from those we face with respect to our domestic properties and operations. These risks include, but are not limited to, any international currency gain or loss recognized with respect to changes in exchange rates, which may not qualify under the 75% gross income test or the 95% gross income test required for us to satisfy annually in order to qualify and maintain our status as a REIT; challenges with respect to the repatriation of foreign earnings and cash; impact from international trade disputes and the associated impact on our tenants' supply chain and consumer spending levels; changes in foreign political, regulatory, and economic conditions (regionally, nationally and locally) including, but not limited to, challenges in managing international operations; challenges of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations, including those relating to real estate, corporate governance, operations, taxes, employment and other civil and criminal legal proceedings; foreign ownership restrictions with respect to operations in foreign countries; local businesses and cultural factors that differ from our usual standards and practices; differences in lending practices and the willingness of domestic or foreign lenders to provide financing; regional or country-specific business cycles and political and economic instability; and failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations in the U.S. that affect foreign operations, including, but not limited to, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic may subject our international business and that of our operators and tenants to different or greater risks than those faced in the U.S. These factors may include the duration and severity of the outbreak in a particular country due to the impact of new variants, the distribution of vaccines and boosters, or public health measures or other actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic.\nIf our tenants do not renew their existing leases, or if we are required to sell properties for liquidity reasons,\nwe may be unable to lease or sell the properties on favorable terms, or at all\nWe cannot predict whether our tenants will renew existing leases at the end of their lease terms, which expire at various times. If these leases are not renewed, we would be required to find other tenants to occupy those properties, or sell them. There can be no assurance that we would be able to identify suitable replacement tenants or enter into leases with new tenants on terms as favorable to us as the current leases or that we would be able to lease those properties at all. Our competitors may offer space at rental rates below current market rates or below the rental rates we currently charge our customers, we may lose potential customers, and we may be pressured to reduce our rental rates below those we currently charge to retain customers when leases expire. In addition, our ability to reposition our properties with a suitable replacement tenant or operator could be significantly delayed or limited by state licensing, receivership, CON or other laws, as well as by the Medicare and Medicaid change-of-ownership rules, and we could incur substantial additional expenses in connection with any licensing, receivership or change-of-ownership proceedings. Even if tenants decide to renew or lease new space, the terms of renewals or new leases, including the cost of required renovations or concessions to tenants, may be less favorable to us than current lease terms.\n32\nReal estate investments are relatively illiquid and most of the property we own is highly customized for specific uses. Our ability to quickly sell or exchange any of our properties in response to changes in operator, economic and other conditions will be limited. No assurances can be given that we will recognize full value for any property that we are required to sell. Our inability to respond rapidly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us.\nOur tenants, operators and managers may not have the necessary insurance coverage to insure adequately against losses\nWe maintain or require our tenants, operators and managers to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties and their operations with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are customary for similarly situated companies in our industry and we frequently review our insurance programs and requirements. Our tenants, operators and managers may not be able to maintain adequate levels of insurance and required coverages. Also, we may not be able to require the same levels of insurance coverage under our lease, management and other agreements, which could adversely affect us in the event of a significant uninsured loss. We cannot make any guarantee as to the future financial viability of the insurers that underwrite our policies and the policies maintained by our tenants, operators and managers. Insurance may not be available at a reasonable cost in the future or policies may not be maintained at a level that will fully cover all losses on our properties upon the occurrence of a catastrophic event. This may be especially the case due to increases in property insurance costs. In addition, in recent years, long-term/post-acute care and seniors housing operators and managers have experienced substantial increases in both the number and size of patient care liability claims. As a result, general and professional liability costs have increased in some markets. Due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, general and professional liability insurance coverage may be restricted or very costly, which may adversely affect the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ future operations, cash flows and financial conditions, and may have a material adverse effect on the tenants’, operators’ and managers’ ability to meet their obligations to us. Finally, our use, and the usage by some of our tenants, operators and managers of self-insurance and/or use of a wholly owned captive insurance company, if not adequately funded, could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and that of our tenants, operators and managers.\nOur ownership of properties through ground leases exposes us to the loss of such\nproperties upon breach or termination of the ground leases\nWe have acquired an interest in certain of our properties by acquiring a leasehold interest in the property on which the building is located, and we may acquire additional properties in the future through the purchase of interests in ground leases. Many of these ground leases impose significant limitations on our uses of the subject properties, restrict our ability to sell or otherwise transfer our interests in the properties or restrict the leasing of the properties. These restrictions may limit our ability to timely sell or exchange the properties, impair the properties’ value or negatively impact our ability to find suitable tenants for the properties. As the lessee under a ground lease, we are exposed to the possibility of losing the property upon termination of the ground lease or an earlier breach of the ground lease by us.\nThe requirements of, or changes to, governmental reimbursement programs, such as Medicare, Medicaid or government funding, could have a material adverse effect on our obligors’ liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect our obligors’ ability to meet their obligations to us\nSome of our obligors’ businesses are affected by government reimbursement. To the extent that an operator/tenant receives a significant portion of its revenues from government payors, primarily Medicare and Medicaid, such revenues may be subject to statutory and regulatory changes, retroactive rate adjustments, recovery of program overpayments or set-offs, court decisions, administrative rulings, policy interpretations, payment or other delays by fiscal intermediaries or carriers, change-of-ownership rules, government funding restrictions (at a program level or with respect to specific facilities), any lapse in Congressional funding of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and interruption or delays in payments due to any ongoing government investigations and audits at such property. In recent years, government payors have frozen or reduced payments to health care providers due to budgetary pressures. Federal and state authorities may continue seeking to implement new or modified reimbursement methodologies that may negatively impact health care property operations. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Reimbursement” above for additional information. Health care reimbursement will likely continue to be of paramount importance to federal and state authorities. We cannot make any assessment as to the ultimate timing or effect any future legislative reforms may have on the financial condition of our obligors and properties. There can be no assurance that adequate reimbursement levels will be available for services provided by any property operator, whether the property receives reimbursement from Medicare, Medicaid or private payors. Significant limits on the scope of services reimbursed and on reimbursement rates and fees could have a material adverse effect on an obligor’s liquidity, financial condition and results of operations, which could adversely affect the ability of an obligor to meet its obligations to us.\nSince January 1, 2014, the Health Reform Laws have provided those states that expand their Medicaid coverage to otherwise eligible state residents with incomes at or below 138% of the federal poverty level with an increased federal medical assistance percentage, effective January 1, 2014, when certain conditions are met. Given that the federal government substantially funds the Medicaid expansion, it is unclear how many states will ultimately pursue this option, although, as of early January 2022,\n33\nmore than 75% of the states have expanded Medicaid coverage. The participation by states in the Medicaid expansion could have the dual effect of increasing our tenants’ revenues, through new patients, but further straining state budgets and their ability to pay our tenants.\nWhile there have been multiple attempts to repeal or amend the Health Reform Laws through legislative action and legal challenges, legislative attempts to completely repeal the Health Reform Laws have been unsuccessful to date, and on June 17, 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court dismissed the most recent judicial challenge to the Health Reform Laws brought by several states without specifically ruling on the constitutionality of the Health Reform Laws. Nevertheless, the status of the Health Reform Laws may be subject to change and other health reform measures could be implemented as a result of political, legislative, regulatory, and administrative developments and judicial proceedings. Further impact that the Biden Administration or U.S. Congress may  have on health reform (including through new legislative, executive order, or regulatory efforts) remains uncertain, and any changes will likely take time to unfold and could have an impact on coverage and reimbursement for health care items and services covered by plans that were authorized by the Health Reform Laws. If the operations, cash flows or financial condition of our operators and tenants are materially adversely impacted by the Health Reform Laws or future legislation, our revenue and operations may be adversely affected as well. More generally, and because of the dynamic nature of the legislative and regulatory environment for health care products and services, and in light of existing federal deficit and budgetary concerns, we cannot predict the impact that broad-based, far-reaching legislative or regulatory changes could have on the U.S. economy, our business, or that of our operators and tenants.\nIf controls imposed on certain of our tenants who provide health care services that are reimbursed by Medicare, Medicaid and other third-party payors to reduce admissions and length of stay affect inpatient volumes at our health care facilities, the financial condition or results of operations of those tenants could be adversely affected\nControls imposed by Medicare, Medicaid and commercial third-party payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay, commonly referred to as “utilization reviews,” have affected and are expected to continue to affect certain of our health care facilities, specifically our acute care hospitals and post-acute facilities. Utilization review entails the review of the admission and course of treatment of a patient by managed care plans. Inpatient utilization, average lengths of stay and occupancy rates continue to be negatively affected by payor-required pre-admission authorization and utilization review and by payor pressures to maximize outpatient and alternative health care delivery services for less acutely ill patients. Efforts to impose more stringent cost controls and reductions are expected to continue, which could negatively impact the financial condition of our tenants who provide health care services in our hospitals and post-acute facilities. If so, this could adversely affect these tenants’ ability and willingness to comply with the terms of their leases with us and/or renew those leases upon expiration, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nOur operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with federal, state, province, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards could adversely affect such operators’ or tenants’ operations, which could adversely affect our operators’ and tenants’ ability to meet their obligations to us\nOur operators and tenants generally are subject to or impacted by varying levels of federal, state, local, and industry-regulated licensure, certification and inspection laws, regulations, and standards. These laws and regulations include, among others: laws protecting consumers against deceptive practices; laws relating to the operation of our properties and how our tenants and operators conduct their business, such as fire, health and safety, data security and privacy laws; federal and state laws affecting hospitals, clinics and other health care communities that participate in both Medicare and Medicaid that specify reimbursement rates, pricing, reimbursement procedures and limitations, quality of services and care, background checks, food service and physical plants, and similar foreign laws regulating the health care industry; resident rights laws (including abuse and neglect laws) and fraud laws; anti-kickback and physician referral laws; the ADA and similar state and local laws; and safety and health standards set by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration or similar foreign agencies. Our operators’ or tenants’ failure to comply with any of these laws, regulations, or standards could result in loss of accreditation, denial of reimbursement, imposition of fines, suspension, decertification or exclusion from federal and state health care programs, civil liability, and in certain limited instances, criminal penalties, material restrictions on or loss of license, closure of the facility and/or the incurrence of considerable costs arising from an investigation or regulatory action. The likelihood of these actions may increase due to the uncertainty of the long term effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. Such actions may have an effect on our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make lease payments to us and, therefore, adversely impact us. In addition, we may be directly subject to these laws, regulations and standards, as well as potential investigation or enforcement, as a result of our RIDEA-structured arrangements, and certain other arrangements we may pursue with healthcare entities who are directly subject to these laws. See “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Fraud & Abuse Enforcement” and “Item 1 - Business - Certain Government Regulations - United States - Health Care Matters - Generally” above.\nMany of our properties may require a license, registration, and/or CON to operate. Failure to obtain a license, registration, or CON, or loss of a required license, registration, or CON would prevent a facility from operating in the manner intended by the operators or tenants. These events could materially adversely affect our operators’ or tenants’ ability to make rent or other obligatory payments to us. State and local laws also may regulate the expansion, including the addition of new beds or services or acquisition of medical equipment, and the construction or renovation of health care facilities, by requiring a CON or other\n34\nsimilar approval from a state agency. See “Item 1 — Business — Certain Government Regulations — United States — Licensing and Certification” above.\nIn addition, we cannot assure you that future changes in government regulation will not adversely affect the health care industry, including our tenants and operators, nor can we be certain that our tenants and operators will achieve and maintain occupancy and rate levels or labor cost levels that will enable them to satisfy their obligations to us.\nUnfavorable resolution of pending and future litigation matters and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition\nFrom time to time, we are directly involved or named as a party in in legal proceedings, lawsuits and other claims that involve class actions, disputes regarding property damage, care matters and other issues. We also are named as defendants in lawsuits allegedly arising out of our actions or the actions of our operators/tenants or managers in which such operators/tenants or managers have agreed to indemnify, defend and hold us harmless from and against various claims, litigation and liabilities arising in connection with their respective businesses. Employment related class action lawsuits have increased in recent years, including but not limited to class action lawsuits brought against our operators in certain states regarding employee and government requirements regarding wage and hour claims and fair housing complaints, as well as class action lawsuits related to COVID-19. There can be no assurance that we will be able to prevail in, or achieve a favorable settlement of, pending or future litigation. In addition, pending litigation or future litigation, government proceedings or environmental matters could lead to increased costs or interruption of our normal business operations. An unfavorable resolution of pending or future litigation or legal proceedings may have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition. Regardless of its outcome, litigation may result in substantial costs and expenses, significantly divert the attention of management, and could damage our reputation and our brand. In addition, any such resolution could involve our agreement to terms that restrict the operation of our business. We cannot guarantee losses incurred in connection with any current or future legal or regulatory proceedings or actions will not exceed any provisions we may have set aside in respect of such proceedings or actions or will not exceed any available insurance coverage.\nDevelopment, redevelopment and construction risks could affect our profitability\nWe invest in various development and redevelopment projects. In deciding whether to acquire or develop a particular property, we make assumptions regarding the expected future performance of that property. In particular, we estimate the return on our investment based on expected construction costs, lease up velocity, occupancy, rental rates, operating expenses, capital costs and future competition. If our financial projections with respect to a new property are inaccurate, the property may fail to perform as we expected in analyzing our investment. Our estimate of the costs of repositioning or redeveloping an acquired property may prove to be inaccurate, which may result in our failure to meet our profitability goals.\nOur development/redevelopment and construction projects are vulnerable to the impact of material shortages and inflation. For example, shortages and fluctuations in the price of lumber or in other important raw materials could result in delays in the start or completion of, or increase the cost of, developing one or more of our projects. Pricing for labor and raw materials can be affected by various national, regional, local, economic and political factors, including changes to immigration laws that impact the availability of labor or tariffs on imported construction materials.\nIn connection with our renovation, redevelopment, development and related construction activities, we may be unable to obtain, or suffer delays in obtaining, necessary zoning, land-use, building, occupancy and other required governmental permits and authorizations, or satisfactory tax rates, incentives or abatements. Operators of new facilities we construct may need to obtain Medicare and Medicaid certification and enter into Medicare and Medicaid provider agreements and/or third-party payor contracts. In the event that the operator is unable to obtain the necessary licensure, certification, provider agreements or contracts after the completion of construction, there is a risk that we will not be able to earn any revenues on the facility until either the initial operator obtains a license or certification to operate the new facility and the necessary provider agreements or contracts or we find and contract with a new operator that is able to obtain a license to operate the facility for its intended use and the necessary provider agreements or contracts. We have experienced such delays in obtaining necessary licensing for constructed properties and may experience additional or more significant delays in the future.\nWe rely on our development managers, general contractors and subcontractors to oversee and manage day-to-day construction activities. If any such party underperforms, we may need to exercise contractual remedies against such party, which may include termination of the applicable underlying service contract. In the event such termination occurs mid-construction, we would likely need to engage a new service provider, which would likely result in additional costs and delays as the transition between providers occurs.\nThe above-described factors could result in increased costs or our abandonment of these projects. In addition, we may abandon opportunities we have begun to investigate, for a range of reasons, including changes in expected financing or construction costs, adverse changes in expected rents or expenses, adverse environmental and/or geotechnical findings, or conditions to zoning approval, which would result in additional expenses beyond those originally expected. In addition, we may not be able to obtain financing on favorable terms, or at all, which may render us unable to proceed with our development activities. We may not be able to complete construction and lease-up of a property on budget and on schedule, which could result in increased debt service expense or construction costs. Additionally, the time frame required for development,\n35\nconstruction and lease-up of these properties means that we may have to wait years for significant cash returns. Because we are required to make cash distributions to our stockholders, if the cash flow from operations or refinancing is not sufficient, we may be forced to borrow additional money to fund such distributions. Newly developed and acquired properties may not produce the cash flow that we expect, which could adversely affect our overall financial performance.\nWe may experience losses caused by severe weather conditions, natural disasters or the physical effects of climate change, which could result in an increase of our or our tenants’ cost of insurance, unanticipated costs associated with evacuation, a decrease in our anticipated revenues or a significant loss of the capital we have invested in a property\nWe maintain or require our tenants to maintain comprehensive insurance coverage on our properties with terms, conditions, limits and deductibles that we believe are appropriate given the relative risk and costs of such coverage. However, a large number of our properties are located in areas particularly susceptible to revenue loss, cost increase or damage caused by severe weather conditions or natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes and floods, as well as the effects of climate change. We believe, given current industry practice and analysis prepared by outside consultants, that our and our tenants’ insurance coverage is appropriate to cover reasonably anticipated losses that may be caused by hurricanes, earthquakes, tornadoes, floods, wildfires and other severe weather conditions and natural disasters, including the effects of climate change. Nevertheless, we are always subject to the risk that such insurance will not fully cover all losses and, depending on the severity of the event and the impact on our properties, such insurance may not cover a significant portion of the losses including but not limited to the costs associated with evacuation. These losses may lead to an increase of our and our tenants’ cost of insurance, a decrease in our anticipated revenues from an affected property and a loss of all or a portion of the capital we have invested in an affected property. In addition, we or our tenants may not purchase insurance under certain circumstances if the cost of insurance exceeds, in our or our tenants’ judgment, the value of the coverage relative to the risk of loss.\nAlso, changes in federal and state legislation and regulation relating to climate change could result in increased capital expenditures to improve the energy efficiency and resiliency of our existing properties and could also necessitate us to spend more on our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue.\nTo the extent that significant changes in the climate occur in areas where our communities are located, we may experience extreme weather and changes in precipitation and temperature, all of which may result in physical damage to or a decrease in demand for properties located in these areas or affected by these conditions. Should the impact of climate change be material, including significant property damage to or destruction of our communities, or occur for lengthy periods of time, our financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected. In addition, changes in federal, state and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased capital expenditures on our existing properties and our new development properties without a corresponding increase in revenue, resulting in adverse impacts to our net income.\nWe may incur costs to remediate environmental contamination at our properties, which could have an adverse effect on our or our obligors’ business or financial condition\nUnder various laws, owners or operators of real estate may be required to respond to the presence or release of hazardous substances on the property and may be held liable for property damage, personal injuries or penalties that result from environmental contamination or exposure to hazardous substances. These laws often impose liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of the release of the substances or caused the release. We may become liable to reimburse the government for damages and costs it incurs in connection with the contamination. Generally, such liability attaches to a person based on the person’s relationship to the property. Our tenants or borrowers are primarily responsible for the condition of the property. Moreover, we review environmental site assessments of the properties that we own or encumber prior to taking an interest in them. Those assessments are designed to meet the “all appropriate inquiry” standard, which we believe qualifies us for the innocent purchaser defense if environmental liabilities arise. Based upon such assessments, we do not believe that any of our properties are subject to material environmental contamination. However, environmental liabilities may be present in our properties and we may incur costs to remediate contamination, which could have a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition or the business or financial condition of our obligors.\nCybersecurity incidents could disrupt our business and result in the loss of confidential information and legal liability\nOur business is at risk from and may be impacted by cybersecurity attacks, including attempts to gain unauthorized access to our confidential data through phishing or other malicious activity, attempts to interrupt our access to, or use of information technology systems through distributed denial-of-service or ransomware attacks, breaches related to our increased receipt and use of data from multiple sources, and other electronic security breaches or other cybersecurity incidents within our environment or our business partners' environments, including those resulting from human error, product defects and technology failures. Such cyber-attacks can range from individual attempts to gain unauthorized access to our or our business partners' information technology systems to more sophisticated security threats and may be specifically targeted to our business or more general industry wide risks. Our information technology networks, and those of our business partners are essential to our ability to perform day-to-day operations of our business. While we employ a number of measures to prevent, detect and mitigate these threats, there is no guarantee such efforts will be successful in preventing or detecting a cyber-attack. Even the most well-protected information, networks, systems and facilities remain vulnerable because the techniques used in such attempted cybersecurity breaches evolve and generally are not recognized until launched against a target, and in some cases are\n36\ndesigned not to be detected and, in fact, may not be detected. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, implement adequate cybersecurity barriers or other preventative measures, or respond, mitigate the risks from and recover from an attack without operational impact, and thus it is impossible for us to entirely mitigate this risk. We regularly defend against, respond to and mitigate risks from cybersecurity breaches, which to date have not had a material impact on our operations; however, there is no assurance that such impacts will not be material in the future. Cybersecurity incidents could disrupt our or our critical business partners’ business, damage our reputation, cause us to incur significant remediation expense and have a materially adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nCybersecurity breaches that compromise proprietary, personal identifying or confidential information of our employees, operators, tenants and partners, or result in operational disruptions, could result in legal claims or proceedings, including enforcement actions by regulators under data privacy regulations.\nEvolving privacy regulations could expose our business to reputational harm and losses\nRegulatory authorities around the world have implemented or are considering implementing a number of legislative changes or regulations concerning data protection, which have required or may require us to incur additional expenses and may expose us to additional risks. We are subject to numerous laws and regulations governing the protection of personal and confidential information of our clients or employees, including U.S. federal and state laws (including. but not limited to the State of California), and non- U.S. laws, such as the General Data Protection Regulation and the EU General Data Protection Regulation, which impose a number of obligations on us. These obligations vary from state to state and country to country, but generally have accountability and transparency including consent, detailed information and data removal and security requirements. Some jurisdictions impose the same requirements and restrictions on transfers of data from their jurisdictions to jurisdictions that they do not consider adequate. This may have implications for our cross-border data flows and may result in additional compliance costs.\nMany jurisdictions assess fines, the magnitude of which may depend on the annual global revenue of the noncompliant company, the nature, gravity and duration of, and the violation. Additionally, in some jurisdictions, data subjects may have a right to compensation for financial or non-financial losses. Complying with these laws may cause us to incur substantial operational and compliance costs or require us to change our business practices. Despite efforts to bring our practices into compliance with these laws, we may not be successful either due to internal or external factors such as resource allocation limitations or a lack of cooperation among our business partners. Non-compliance could result in proceedings against us by governmental entities, regulators, our business partners, residents of our communities, data subjects, suppliers, vendors or other parties. Further, there is a risk that compliance measures we undertake will not be implemented correctly or that individuals within our business or that of our business partners will not be fully compliant with the new procedures. If there are breaches of these measures, we could face significant administrative and monetary sanctions, as well as reputational damage, which may have a material adverse effect on our operations, financial condition and prospects.\nOur success and the success of our operators and managers depends on key personnel whose continued service is not guaranteed\nOur success and the success of our operators and managers depends on the continued availability and service of key personnel, including executive officers and other highly qualified employees, and competition for their talents is intense. There is substantial competition for qualified personnel. We cannot assure you that we will retain our key personnel or that we will be able to recruit and retain other highly qualified employees in the future. Losing any key personnel could, at least temporarily, have a material adverse effect on our business and that of our operators and managers', financial position and results of operations.\nRisks Arising from Our Capital Structure\nWe may become more leveraged\nPermanent financing for our investments is typically provided through a combination of public offerings of debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt. The incurrence or assumption of indebtedness may cause us to become more leveraged, which could (1) require us to dedicate a greater portion of our cash flow to the payment of debt service, (2) make us more vulnerable to a downturn in the economy, (3) limit our ability to obtain additional financing, (4) negatively affect our credit ratings or outlook by one or more of the rating agencies or (5) make us more vulnerable to increases in interest rates because of the variable interest rates on some of our borrowings to the extent we have not entirely hedged such variable rate debt.\nCash available for distributions to stockholders may be insufficient to make dividend contributions at expected levels and are made at the discretion of the Board of Directors\nIf cash available for distribution generated by our assets decreases due to dispositions or otherwise, we may be unable to make dividend distributions at expected levels. Our inability to make expected distributions would likely result in a decrease in the market price of our common stock. All distributions are made at the discretion of our Board of Directors in accordance with Delaware law and depend on our earnings, our financial condition, debt and equity capital available to us, our expectation of\n37\nour future capital requirements and operating performance, restrictive covenants in our financial and other contractual arrangements, maintenance of our REIT qualification, restrictions under Delaware law and other factors as our Board of Directors may deem relevant from time to time. Additionally, our ability to make distributions will be adversely affected if any of the risks described herein, or other significant adverse events, occur.\nWe are subject to covenants in our debt agreements that could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Among other things, these provisions require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. Breaches of these covenants could result in defaults under the instruments governing the applicable indebtedness, in addition to any other indebtedness cross-defaulted against such instruments. These defaults could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLimitations on our ability to access capital could have an adverse effect on our ability to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to raise the capital necessary to make future investments or to meet our obligations and commitments as they mature. Our access to capital depends upon a number of factors over which we have little or no control, including rising interest rates, inflation and other general market conditions; the market’s perception of our growth potential and our current and potential future earnings and cash distributions; the market price of the shares of our common stock and the credit ratings of our debt securities; changes in the credit ratings on U.S. government debt securities; uncertainty from the expected discontinuance of LIBOR and the transition to any other interest rate benchmark; and default or delay in payment by the U.S. of its obligations. We also rely on the financial institutions that are parties to our revolving credit facilities. If these institutions become capital constrained, tighten their lending standards or become insolvent or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests from other borrowers within a short period of time, they may be unable or unwilling to honor their funding commitments to us, which would adversely affect our ability to draw on our revolving credit facilities and, over time, could negatively impact our ability to consummate acquisitions, repay indebtedness as it matures, fund capital expenditures or make distributions to our stockholders. If our access to capital is limited by these factors or other factors, it could negatively impact our ability to acquire properties, repay or refinance our indebtedness, fund operations or make distributions to our stockholders.\nChanges affecting the availability of the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) may have consequences for us that cannot yet reasonably be predicted\nWe have outstanding debt, hedge agreements and receivable transactions with variable interest rates based on LIBOR. The LIBOR benchmark has been subject of national, international, and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform. In March 2021, ICE Benchmark Administration, the administrator of LIBOR, confirmed that it would cease publication of USD LIBOR on December 31, 2021 for the one week and two month USD LIBOR tenors, and on June 30, 2023 for all other USD LIBOR tenors. As a result, the United States Federal Reserve has advised banks to stop new USD LIBOR issuances by the end of 2021. The Alternative Reference Rates Committee, which was convened by the Federal Reserve Board and the New York Fed, has identified the Second Oversight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") as the recommended alternative rate for LIBOR. While it is not currently possible to determine precisely whether, or to what extent, the withdrawal and replacement of LIBOR would affect us, the implementation of SOFR or other alternative benchmark rates to LIBOR may have an adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. Any new benchmark rate will likely not replicate LIBOR exactly, which could impact contracts that terminate after 2023. There is uncertainty about how applicable law, the courts or we will address the replacement of LIBOR with alternative rates on agreements that do not include alternative rate fallback provisions. In addition, any changes to benchmark rates may have an uncertain impact on our cost of funds and our access to the capital markets, which could impact our results of operations and cash flows. Uncertainty as to the nature of such potential changes may also adversely affect the trading market for our securities. Additional financing, therefore, may be unavailable, more expensive or restricted by the terms of our outstanding indebtedness.\nDowngrades in our credit ratings could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital\nWe plan to manage the company to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain our current credit ratings. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse effect on our cost and availability of capital, which could in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity, cash flows, the trading/redemption price of our securities and our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations and to pay dividends and distributions to our equity holders.\nIncreases in interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our cost of capital\nAn increase in interest rates may increase interest cost on new and existing variable rate debt.  Such increases in the cost of capital could adversely impact our ability to finance operations, acquire and develop properties, and refinance existing debt. Additionally, increased interest rates may also result in less liquid property markets, limiting our ability to sell existing assets.\n38\nRisks Arising from Our Status as a REIT\nWe might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT\nWe intend to operate as a REIT under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the “Code”), and believe we have operated and will continue to operate in such a manner. If we lose our status as a REIT, we will face serious income tax consequences that will substantially reduce the funds available for satisfying our obligations and for distribution to our stockholders because:\n•\nwe would not be allowed a deduction for distributions to stockholders in computing our taxable income and would be subject to U.S. federal income tax at regular corporate rates;\n•\nwe would be subject to increased state and local taxes; and\n•\nunless we are entitled to relief under statutory provisions, we could not elect to be subject to tax as a REIT for four taxable    years following the year during which we were disqualified.\nSince REIT qualification requires us to meet a number of complex requirements, it is possible that we may fail to fulfill them, and if we do, our earnings will be reduced by the amount of U.S. federal and other income taxes owed. A reduction in our earnings would affect the amount we could distribute to our stockholders. If we do not qualify as a REIT, we will not be required to make distributions to stockholders, since a non-REIT is not required to pay dividends to stockholders in order to maintain REIT status or avoid an excise tax. In addition, if we fail to qualify as a REIT, all distributions to stockholders will continue to be treated as dividends to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits, although corporate stockholders may be eligible for the dividends received deduction, and individual stockholders may be eligible for taxation at the rates generally applicable to long-term capital gains with respect to distributions.\nAs a result of all these factors, our failure to qualify as a REIT also could impair our ability to implement our business strategy and would adversely affect the value of our common stock. Qualification as a REIT involves the application of highly technical and complex Code provisions for which there are only limited judicial and administrative interpretations. The determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control may affect our ability to remain qualified as a REIT. Although we believe that we qualify as a REIT, we cannot assure you that we will remain qualified as a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes.\nCertain subsidiaries might fail to qualify or remain qualified as a REIT\nWe own interests in a number of entities which have elected to be taxed as REITs for U.S. federal income tax purposes, some of which we consolidate for financial reporting purposes but each of which is treated as a separate REIT for federal income tax purposes (each a “Subsidiary REIT”). To qualify as a REIT, each Subsidiary REIT must independently satisfy all of the REIT qualification requirements under the Code, together with all other rules applicable to REITs. Provided that each Subsidiary REIT qualifies as a REIT, our interests in the Subsidiary REITs will be treated as qualifying real estate assets for purposes of the REIT asset tests. If a Subsidiary REIT fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year, such Subsidiary REIT will be subject to federal and state income taxes and may not be able to qualify as a REIT for the four subsequent taxable years. Any such failure could have an adverse effect on our ability to comply with the REIT income and asset tests, and thus our ability to qualify as a REIT, unless we are able to avail ourselves of certain relief provisions.\nThe 90% annual distribution requirement will decrease our liquidity and may limit our ability to engage in otherwise beneficial transactions\nTo comply with the 90% distribution requirement applicable to REITs and to avoid the nondeductible excise tax, we must make distributions to our stockholders. Although we anticipate that we generally will have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the REIT distribution requirement, it is possible that, from time to time, we may not have sufficient cash or other liquid assets to meet the 90% distribution requirement. This may be due to timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses, on the one hand, and the inclusion of that income and deduction of those expenses in arriving at our taxable income, on the other hand. In addition, non-deductible expenses such as principal amortization or repayments or capital expenditures in excess of non-cash deductions may cause us to fail to have sufficient cash or liquid assets to enable us to satisfy the 90% distribution requirement. In the event that timing differences occur, or we deem it appropriate to retain cash, we may borrow funds, even if the then-prevailing market conditions are not favorable for these borrowings, issue additional equity securities (although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so), pay taxable stock dividends, if possible, distribute other property or securities or engage in other transactions intended to enable us to meet the REIT distribution requirements. This may require us to raise additional capital to meet our obligations.\nOur use of TRSs is limited under the Code\nUnder the Code, no more than 20% of the value of the gross assets of a REIT may be represented by securities of one or more TRSs. This limitation may affect our ability to increase the size of our TRSs’ operations and assets, and there can be no assurance that we will be able to comply with the applicable limitation, or that such compliance will not adversely affect our business. Also, our TRSs may not, among other things, operate or manage certain health care facilities, which may cause us to forgo investments we might otherwise make. Finally, we may be subject to a 100% excise tax on the income derived from certain transactions with our TRSs that are not on an arm's-length basis. We believe our arrangements with our TRSs are on\n39\narm's-length terms and intend to continue to operate in a manner that allows us to avoid incurring the 100% excise tax described above, but there can be no assurance that we will be able to avoid application of that tax.\nThe lease of qualified health care properties to a taxable REIT subsidiary is subject to special requirements\nWe lease certain qualified health care properties to taxable REIT subsidiaries (or limited liability companies of which the taxable REIT subsidiaries are members), which lessees contract with managers (or related parties) to manage the health care operations at these properties. The rents from this taxable REIT subsidiary lessee structure are treated as qualifying rents from real property if (1) they are paid pursuant to an arm's-length lease of a qualified health care property with a taxable REIT subsidiary and (2) the manager qualifies as an eligible independent contractor (as defined in the Code). If any of these conditions are not satisfied, then the rents will not be qualifying rents.\nIf certain sale-leaseback transactions are not characterized by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) as “true leases,” we may be subject to adverse tax consequences\nWe have purchased certain properties and leased them back to the sellers of such properties, and we may enter into similar transactions in the future. We intend for any such sale-leaseback transaction to be structured in such a manner that the lease will be characterized as a “true lease,” thereby allowing us to be treated as the owner of the property for U.S. federal income tax purposes. However, depending on the terms of any specific transaction, the IRS might take the position that the transaction is not a “true lease” but is more properly treated in some other manner. In the event any sale-leaseback transaction is challenged and successfully re-characterized by the IRS, we would not be entitled to claim the deductions for depreciation and cost recovery generally available to an owner of property. Furthermore, if a sale-leaseback transaction were so re-characterized, we might fail to satisfy the REIT asset tests or income tests and, consequently, could lose our REIT status effective with the year of re-characterization. Alternatively, the amount of our REIT taxable income could be recalculated, which may cause us to fail to meet the REIT annual distribution requirements for a taxable year.\nWe could be subject to changes in our tax rates, the adoption of new U.S. or international tax legislation, or exposure to additional tax liabilities\nWe are subject to taxes in the U.S. and foreign jurisdictions. Because the U.S. maintains a worldwide corporate tax system, the foreign and U.S. tax systems are somewhat interdependent. Longstanding international norms that determine each country's jurisdiction to tax cross-border international trade are evolving and could reduce the ability of our foreign subsidiaries to deduct for foreign tax purposes the interest they pay on loans from us, thereby increasing the foreign tax liability of the subsidiaries; it is also possible that foreign countries could increase their withholding taxes on dividends and interest.\nOur effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates or changes in tax laws or their interpretation. We are also subject to the examination of our tax returns and other tax matters by the IRS and other tax authorities and governmental bodies. We regularly assess the likelihood of an adverse outcome resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for taxes. There can be no assurance as to the outcome of these examinations. If we were subject to review or examination by the IRS or applicable foreign jurisdiction as the result of any new tax law changes, the ultimate determination of which may change our taxes owed for an amount in excess of amounts previously accrued or recorded, our financial condition, operating results, and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nThe present federal income tax treatment of REITs may be modified, possibly with retroactive effect, by legislative, judicial or administrative action at any time, which could affect the federal income tax treatment of an investment in us. The federal income tax rules dealing with U.S. federal income taxation and REITs are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process, the IRS and the U.S. Treasury Department, which results in statutory changes as well as frequent revisions to regulations and interpretations.\nWe cannot predict how changes in the tax laws in the U.S. or foreign jurisdictions might affect our investors or us. Revisions in tax laws and interpretations thereof could significantly and negatively affect our ability to qualify as a REIT, as well as the tax considerations relevant to an investment in us, could cause us to change our investments and commitments, and adversely affect our earnings and cash flow."

Other important factors are identified in “Item 1 — Business” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” above.\nExecutive Summary\nCompany Overview\nWelltower Inc. (NYSE:WELL), an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The Company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower\n™\n, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (U.S.), Canada and the United Kingdom (U.K.), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties.\nThe following table summarizes our consolidated portfolio for the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nRepresents consolidated net operating income (\"NOI\") and excludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount. See Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliation.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had and may continue to have material and adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our operators and tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the effectiveness of vaccines, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact and the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, the overall pace of recovery, among others.\nOur Seniors Housing Operating revenues are dependent on occupancy. Spot occupancy has steadily increased in recent months, with 94% of communities open for new admissions and nearly all communities allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining and activities as of December 31, 2021. Rapid distribution and a high acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccinations by residents within assisted living and memory care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. have resulted in a significant decrease in total resident case counts across the portfolio from peak levels in mid-January 2021, however, resident case counts have increased in December 2021 as a result of highly transmissible variants.\nWe have incurred increased operational costs as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor, personal protective equipment and sanitation. We expect total Seniors Housing Operating expenses to remain elevated during the pandemic and potentially beyond as these additional health and safety measures become standard practice.\nOur Triple-net operators are experiencing similar trends related to occupancy and operating costs as described above with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. However, long-term/post-acute care facilities are generally experiencing a higher degree of occupancy declines. These factors may continue to impact the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us in the future. Many of our Triple-net operators received funds under the Coronavirus Aid Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) Paycheck Protection Program and Provider Relief Fund.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected approximately 94% of rent due from operators under Triple-net lease agreements (primarily seniors housing and post-acute care facilities). No significant rent deferrals or rent concessions have been made during the year ended December 31, 2021. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable. To the extent the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic causes operators or tenants to seek further modifications of their lease agreements, we may recognize reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables.\nDuring the early stages of the pandemic in 2020, our Outpatient Medical tenants experienced temporary medical practice closures or decreases in revenue due to government-imposed restrictions on elective medical procedures, stay at home orders or decisions by patients to delay treatments. In some instances, these factors caused tenants to seek modifications of contractual\n46\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nrent obligations. We evaluated each request on a case-by-case basis to determine if a form of rent relief was warranted following an examination of the tenant's financial health, rent coverage, current operating situation and other factors. Virtually all deferred rent related to 2020 deferrals has been paid. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we have continued to collect virtually all rent due from tenants in our Outpatient Medical portfolio, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with COVID-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur primary objectives are to protect stockholder capital and enhance stockholder value. We seek to pay consistent cash dividends to stockholders and create opportunities to increase dividend payments to stockholders as a result of annual increases in NOI and portfolio growth. To meet these objectives, we invest across the full spectrum of seniors housing and health care real estate and diversify our investment portfolio by property type, relationship and geographic location.\nSubstantially all of our revenues are derived from operating lease rentals, resident fees and services and interest earned on outstanding loans receivable. These items represent our primary sources of liquidity to fund distributions and depend upon the continued ability of our obligors to make contractual rent and interest payments to us and the profitability of our operating properties. To the extent that our obligors/partners experience operating difficulties and become unable to generate sufficient cash to make payments or operating distributions to us, there could be a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. To mitigate this risk, we monitor our investments through a variety of methods determined by the type of property. Our asset management process for seniors housing properties generally includes review of monthly financial statements and other operating data for each property, review of obligor/partner creditworthiness, property inspections and review of covenant compliance relating to licensure, real estate taxes, letters of credit and other collateral. Our internal property management division manages and monitors the outpatient medical portfolio with a comprehensive process including review of tenant relations, lease expirations, the mix of health service providers, hospital/health system relationships, property performance, capital improvement needs and market conditions among other things. We evaluate the operating environment in each property’s market to determine the likely trend in operating performance of the facility. When we identify unacceptable trends, we seek to mitigate, eliminate or transfer the risk. Through these efforts, we generally aim to intervene at an early stage to address any negative trends, and in so doing, support both the collectability of revenue and the value of our investment.\nIn addition to our asset management and research efforts, we also aim to structure our relevant investments to mitigate payment risk. Operating leases and loans are normally credit enhanced by guarantees and/or letters of credit. In addition, operating leases are typically structured as master leases and loans are generally cross-defaulted and cross-collateralized with other real estate loans, operating leases or agreements between us and the obligor and its affiliates.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, resident fees and services and rental income represented 67% and 29%, respectively, of total revenues. Substantially all of our operating leases are designed with escalating rent structures. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Our yield on loans receivable depends upon a number of factors, including the stated interest rate, the average principal amount outstanding during the term of the loan and any interest rate adjustments.\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. Depending upon the availability and cost of external capital, we believe our liquidity is sufficient to fund these uses of cash.\nWe also continuously evaluate opportunities to finance future investments. New investments are generally funded from temporary borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, internally generated cash and the proceeds from investment dispositions. Our investments generate cash from NOI and principal payments on loans receivable. Permanent financing for future investments, which replaces funds drawn under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, has historically been provided through a combination of the issuance of public debt and equity securities and the incurrence or assumption of secured debt.\nDepending upon market conditions, we believe that new investments will be available in the future with spreads over our cost of capital that will generate appropriate returns to our stockholders. It is also likely that investment dispositions may occur in the future. To the extent that investment dispositions exceed new investments, our revenues and cash flows from operations could be adversely affected. We expect to reinvest the proceeds from any investment dispositions in new investments. To the extent that new investment requirements exceed our available cash on-hand, we expect to borrow under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. At December 31, 2021, we had $269,265,000 of cash and cash equivalents, $77,490,000 of restricted cash an\nd $3,675,000,000\nof available borrowing capacity under our unsecured revolving credit facility.\n47\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nKey Transactions\nCapital\nThe following summarizes key capital transactions that occurred during the year ended December 31, 2021:\n•\nIn March 2021, we completed the issuance of $750,000,000 senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 2.80% with a maturity date of June 2031.\n•\nIn April 2021, we repaid our $339,128,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due March 2023, $334,624,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due September 2023, and $15,000,000 of our term loan due April 2022.\n•\nIn June 2021, we closed on a new $4,700,000,000 unsecured credit facility with improved pricing across our line of credit and terminated the existing unsecured credit facility. The credit facility includes $4,000,000,000 of revolving credit capacity at a borrowing rate of 77.5 basis points (\"bps\") over LIBOR, $500,000,000 of USD term loan capacity at a borrowing rate of 90.0 bps over LIBOR and $250,000,000 CAD term loan capacity at 90.0 bps over CDOR.\n•\nIn June 2021, we repaid the remaining $845,000,000 of our term loan due April 2022.\n•\nIn June 2021, we completed the issuance of $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 2.05% with a maturity date of January 2029.\n•\nIn July 2021, we entered into an amended and restated ATM Program (as defined below) pursuant to which we may offer and sell up to $2,500,000,000 of common stock from time to time. During 2021, we sold 34,854,598 shares of common stock under our current and previous ATM Programs via forward sale agreements which are expected to generate gross proceeds of approximately $2,820,855,000, of which 29,667,348 shares have been settled resulting in $2,385,683,000 of gross proceeds during the y\near ended December 31, 2021\n.\n•\nIn November 2021, we completed the issuance of $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes bearing interest at 2.75% with a maturity date of January 2032.\n•\nWe extinguished $132,031,000 of secured debt at a blended average interest rate of 5.86% throughout 2021.\nInve\nstments\nThe following summarizes property acquisitions and joint venture investments completed during the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nRepresents amounts recorded in net real estate investments including fair value adjustments pursuant to U.S. GAAP. See Note 3 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(2)\nRepresents annualized contractual or projected NOI to be received in cash divided by investment amounts.\nDispositions\nThe following summarizes property dispositions completed during the year ended December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nRepresents pro rata proceeds received upon disposition including any seller financing.\n(2)\nRepresents carrying value of net real estate assets at time of disposition. See Note 5 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(3)\nRepresents annualized contractual income that was being received in cash at date of disposition divided by disposition proceeds.\nDividends\nOur Board of Directors declared a cash dividend for the quarter ended December 31, 2021 of $0.61 per share. On March 8, 2022, we will pay our 203\nrd\nconsecutive quarterly dividend payment to stockholders of record on March 1, 2022.\nKey Performance Indicators, Trends and Uncertainties\nWe utilize several key performance indicators to evaluate the various aspects of our business. These indicators are discussed below and relate to operating performance, credit strength and concentration risk. Management uses these key performance indicators to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results, in making operating decisions, and for budget planning purposes.\n48\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nOperating Performance\nWe believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders (“NICS”) per the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income are the most appropriate earnings measures. Other useful supplemental measures of our operating performance include funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) and consolidated net operating income (“NOI”); however, these supplemental measures are not defined by U.S. GAAP. Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliations. These earnings measures are widely used by investors and analysts in the valuation, comparison and investment recommendations of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends of our operating performance measures for the periods presented (in thousands):\nCredit Strength\nWe measure our credit strength both in terms of leverage ratios and coverage ratios. The leverage ratios indicate how much of our balance sheet capitalization is related to long-term debt, net of cash and restricted cash. The coverage ratios indicate our ability to service interest and fixed charges (interest and secured debt principal amortization). We expect to maintain capitalization ratios and coverage ratios sufficient to maintain a capital structure consistent with our current profile. The coverage ratios are based on adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“Adjusted EBITDA”). Please refer to the section entitled “Non-GAAP Financial Measures” for further discussion and reconciliation of these measures. Leverage ratios and coverage ratios are widely used by investors, analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, investment recommendations and rating of companies. The following table reflects the recent historical trends for our credit strength measures for the periods presented:\nConcentration Risk\nWe evaluate our concentration risk in terms of NOI by property mix, relationship mix and geographic mix. Concentration risk is a valuable measure in understanding what portion of our NOI could be at risk if certain sectors were to experience downturns. Property mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our various property types. Relationship mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five relationships. Geographic mix measures the portion of our NOI that relates to our current top five states (or international equivalents). The following table reflects our recent historical trends of concentration risk by NOI for the years indicated below:\n(1)\nExcludes our share of investments in unconsolidated entities and non-segment/corporate NOI. Entities in which we have a joint venture with a minority partner are shown at 100% of the joint venture amount.\n49\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(2)\nRevera owns a controlling interest in Sunrise Senior Living.\nWe evaluate our key performance indicators in conjunction with current expectations to determine if historical trends are indicative of future results. Our expected results may not be achieved and actual results may differ materially from our expectations. Factors that may cause actual results to differ from expected results are described in more detail in “Item 1 — Business — Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Statements” and “Item 1A — Risk Factors” and other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Management regularly monitors economic and other factors to develop strategic and tactical plans designed to improve performance and maximize our competitive position. Our ability to achieve our financial objectives is dependent upon our ability to effectively execute these plans and to appropriately respond to emerging economic and company-specific trends. Please refer to “Item 1 — Business,” “Item 1A — Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion of these risk factors.\nCorporate Governance\nMaintaining investor confidence and trust is important in today’s business environment. Our Board of Directors and management are strongly committed to policies and procedures that reflect the highest level of ethical business practices. Our corporate governance guidelines provide the framework for our business operations and emphasize our commitment to increase stockholder value while meeting all applicable legal requirements. These guidelines meet the listing standards adopted by the New York Stock Exchange and are available on the Internet at www.welltower.com/investors/governance. The information on our website is not incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, and our web address is included as an inactive textual reference only.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nOur primary sources of cash include resident fees and services, rent and interest receipts, borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, public issuances of debt and equity securities, proceeds from investment dispositions and principal payments on loans receivable. Our primary uses of cash include dividend distributions, debt service payments (including principal and interest), real property investments (including acquisitions, capital expenditures, construction advances and transaction costs), loan advances, property operating expenses, general and administrative expenses and other expenses. These sources and uses of cash are reflected in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and are discussed in further detail below. The following is a summary of our sources and uses of cash flows for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nOperating Activities\nThe changes in net cash provided from operating activities are primarily attributable to declines in revenue as a result of decreased occupancy at our Seniors Housing Operating properties, straight-line receivable reserves related to Triple-net leases during the year ended December 31, 2021 and dispositions. Please see “Results of Operations” for discussion of net income fluctuations. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, cash flows from operations exceeded cash distributions to stockholders.\nInvesting Activities\nThe changes in net cash provided from/used in investing activities are primarily attributable to net changes in real property investments and dispositions, loans receivable and investments in unconsolidated entities which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 3 and 5 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. The following is a summary of cash used in non-acquisition capital improvement activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n50\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe change in new development is primarily due to the number and size of construction projects on-going during the relevant periods. Renovations, redevelopments and other capital improvements include expenditures to maximize property value, increase net operating income, maintain a market-competitive position and/or achieve property stabilization.\nFinancing Activities\nThe changes in net cash provided from/used in financing activities are primarily attributable to changes related to our long-term debt arrangements, the issuances of common stock and dividend payments which are summarized above in “Key Transactions.” Please refer to Notes 10, 11 and 14 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nIn March 2021, we completed the issuance of $750,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of June 2031. In June 2021, we completed the issuance of $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of January 2029. Net proceeds from these debt issuances were used to redeem the remaining $339,128,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due 2023, $334,624,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due 2023, and $860,000,000 remaining on our term loan due April 2022. In June 2021, we closed on a new $4,700,000,000 unsecured credit facility. The credit facility includes $4,000,000,000 of revolving credit capacity\n.\nIn November 2021, we completed the issuance of $500,000,000 senior unsecured notes with a maturity date of January 2032.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have total near-term available liquidity of approximatel\ny $4.0 billion.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nAt December 31, 2021, we had investments in unconsolidated entities with our ownership generally ranging from 10% to 65%. We use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate exposure. At December 31, 2021, we had 15 outstanding letter of credit obligations. Please see Notes 8, 12 and 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nContractual Obligations\n51\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table summarizes our payment requirements under contractual obligations as of December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n(1)\nAmounts represent principal amounts due and do not reflect unamortized premiums/discounts or other fair value adjustments as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)\nBased on foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of balance sheet date.\n(3)\nBased on variable interest rates in effect as of December 31, 2021.\n(4)\nSee Note 6 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n(5)\nSee Note 13 to our consolidated financial statements for additional information.\nCapital Structure\nPlease refer to “Credit Strength” above for a discussion of our leverage and coverage ratio trends. Our debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance in all material respects with the covenants under our debt agreements. None of our debt agreements contain provisions for acceleration which could be triggered by our debt ratings. However, under our primary unsecured credit facility, the ratings on our senior unsecured notes are used to determine the fees and interest charged. We plan to manage the company to maintain compliance with our debt covenants and with a capital structure consistent with our current profile. Any downgrades in terms of ratings or outlook by any or all of the rating agencies could have a material adverse impact on our cost and availability of capital, which could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition.\nOn May 4, 2021, we filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) (1) an open-ended automatic or “universal” shelf registration statement on Form S-3 covering an indeterminate amount of future offerings of debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants and units to replace our existing “universal” shelf registration statement filed with the SEC on May 17, 2018, and (2) a registration statement in connection with our enhanced dividend reinvestment plan (“DRIP”) under which we may issue up to 15,000,000 shares of common stock to replace our existing DRIP registration statement on Form S-3 filed with the SEC on May 17, 2018.\nAs of February 4, 2022, 15,000,000 shares of common stock remained available for issuance under the DRIP registration stateme\nnt. On July 30, 2021, we entered into (i) an amended and restated equity distribution agreement (the “EDA”) with each of Robert W. Baird & Co. Incorporated, Barclays Capital Inc., BMO Capital Markets Corp., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., BNY Mellon Capital Markets, LLC, BofA Securities, Inc., BOK Financial Securities, Inc., Capital One Securities Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Comerica Securities, Inc., Credit Agricole Securities (USA) Inc., Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., Fifth Third Securities, Inc., Goldman Sachs & Co.

The A\nTM Program also allows us to enter into forward sale agreements. As of February 4, 2022, we had $1,876,085,000 of remaining capacity under the ATM Program, which excludes forward sales agreements outstanding for the sale of 10,924,956 shares or approximately $930,610,000 with maturity dates in 2022. We expect to physically settle the forward sales for cash proceeds. Depending upon market conditions, we anticipate issuing securities under our registration statements to invest in additional properties and to repay borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program.\nIn connection with the filing of the new “universal” shelf registration statement, the Company also filed with the SEC two prospectus supplements that will continue offerings that were previously covered by prospectus supplements and the accompanying prospectus to the prior registration statement relating to: (i) the registration and possible issuance of up to 620,731 shares of the Company’s common stock (the “DownREIT Shares”), that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the “DownREIT Units”) of HCN G&L DownREIT, LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “DownREIT”), tender such DownREIT Units for redemption by the DownREIT, and HCN DownREIT Member, LLC, a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of the Company (including its permitted successors and assigns, the “Managing Member”), or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount; and (ii) the registration and possible issuance of up to 475,327 shares common stock (the “DownREIT II Shares”), that may be issued from time to time if, and to the extent that, certain holders of Class A units (the “DownREIT II Units,” and collectively with the DownREIT Units, the “Units”) of HCN G&L DownREIT II LLC, a Delaware limited liability company (the “DownREIT II”), tender such DownREIT II Units for redemption by the DownREIT II, and the Managing Member, or a designated affiliate of the Managing Member, elects to assume the redemption obligations of the DownREIT II and to satisfy all or a portion of the redemption consideration by issuing DownREIT II Shares to the holders instead of or in addition to paying a cash amount.\nResults of Operations\nSummary\nOur primary sources of revenue include resident fees and services, rent and interest income. Our primary expenses include property operating expenses, depreciation and amortization, interest expense, general and administrative expenses, and other expenses. We evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our three business segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. The primary performance measures for our properties are NOI and same store NOI (SSNOI) and other supplemental measures include FFO and Adjusted EBITDA, which are further discussed below. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations related to these supplemental measures.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of the Company’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the periods presented (dollars in thousands, except per share amounts):\n53\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table represents the changes in outstanding common stock for the period from January 1, 2019 to December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\nDuring the past three years, inflation has not significantly affected our earnings because of the moderate inflation rate. Additionally, a portion of our earnings are derived primarily from long-term investments with predictable rates of return. These investments are mainly financed with a combination of equity, senior unsecured notes, secured debt and borrowings under our primary unsecured credit facility. During inflationary periods, which generally are accompanied by rising interest rates, our ability to grow may be adversely affected because the yield on new investments may increase at a slower rate than new borrowing costs.\nSeniors Housing Operating\nThe following is a summary of our SSNOI at Welltower's Share for the Seniors Housing Operating segment (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nRel\nates to 489 properties for the QTD Pool and 477\nproperties for the YTD Pool. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations.\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the Seniors Housing Operating segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):\n54\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\nResident fees and services and property operating expenses for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased compared to the prior year primarily due to acquisitions, including the acquisition of the Holiday Retirement portfolio on July 30, 2021 for a total purchase price of $1.6 billion. The increases were partially offset by decreases in spot occupancy across the portfolio due to the COVID-19 pandemic and property dispositions. Spot occupancy remains below pre-pandemic levels but has steadily increased in recent months, with 94% of communities open for new admissions and nearly all communities allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining and activities as of December 31, 2021. Rapid distribution and a high acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccinations by residents within assisted living and memory care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. have resulted in a significant decrease in total resident case counts across the portfolio from peak levels in mid-January 2021, however, resident case counts have increased in December 2021 as a result of highly transmissible variants. As of December 31, 2021, occupancy has increased approximately 510 bps to 77.7% since the pandemic-low of 72.6% on March 12, 2021. Quarterly spot occupancy rates through December 31, 2021 are as follows:\n(1)\nSpot occupancy represents approximate month end occupancy at our share for 546 properties in operation as of December 31, 2020, including unconsolidated properties but excluding acquisitions, executed dispositions, development conversions and one property closed for redevelopment.\n(2)\nSequential occupancy changes are based on actual spot occupancy and may not recalculate due to rounding.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the U.S. and U.K. portfolios reported spot occupancy gains of approximately 490 bps and 80 bps, respectively. Canada reported a spot occupancy decline of approximately 290 bps.\nOn March 27, 2020, the federal government enacted CARES Act to provide financial aid to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received government grants under the CARES Act primarily to cover increased expenses and lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as under similar programs in the U.K. and Canada. Grant income is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with all conditions attached to the grant. Additionally, grants are recognized over the periods in which the Company recognizes the increased expenses and lost revenue the grants are intended to defray. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recognized $97,933,000 and $31,927,000, respectively, of government grant income as a reduction to property operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $4,642,000 and $3,014,000, respectively, of government grant income in other income. The amount of qualifying expenditures and lost revenue exceeded grant income recognized and the Company believes it has complied and will continue to comply with all grant conditions.\n55\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nProperty-level operating expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic relating to our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio totaled $63,681,000 and $110,719,000 for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenses were incurred as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure personal protective equipment (\"PPE\") and supplies, net of reimbursements. Specifically in 2021, we incurred elevated labor expenses resulting from the increased utilization of contract labor due to the rise in occupancy and a challenging labor market.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $22,317,000 related to two held for use properties in which the carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $100,741,000 related to 15 held for sale or sold properties and six held for use properties. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of the purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to the timing of noncapitalizable transaction costs associated with acquisitions and operator transitions. Changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a gain on real estate disposition of $312,249,000 related to an 11 property U.S. portfolio.\nDepreciation and amortization fluctuates as a result of acquisitions, disposition and transitions. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed two Seniors Housing Operating construction projects representing $117,386,000 or $553,573 per unit. The following is a summary of our consolidated Seniors Housing Operating construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nInterest expense represents secured debt interest expense, which fluctuates based on the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The fluctuations in loss (gain) on extinguishment of debt is primarily attributable to the volume of extinguishments and terms of the related secured debt.\nThe following is a summary of our Seniors Housing Operating segment property secured debt principal activity (dollars in thousands):\n56\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe majority of our Seniors Housing Operating properties are formed through partnership interests. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income (loss) related to joint ventures. The decrease compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 relates primarily to our partners' share of gains on real estate dispositions during that year.\nTriple-net\nThe following is a summary of our SSNOI at Welltower's Share for the Triple-net segment (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nRelate\ns to 554 properties for the QTD Pool and 547\nproperties for the YTD Pool. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations.\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the Triple-net segment for the years presented (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\n57\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRental income has increased primarily due to the timing of the establishment of reserves for straight-line rent receivable balances relating to leases for which collection of substantially all contractual lease payments is no longer deemed probable. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded reserves for previously recognized straight-line rent receivables of $49,241,000. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded $146,508,000, which included $91,025,000 related to Genesis Healthcare (\"Genesis\") whom noted substantial doubt as to their ability to continue as a going concern.\nCertain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index and/or changes in the gross operating revenues of the tenant’s properties. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If gross operating revenues at our facilities and/or the Consumer Price Index do not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, we had ten leases with rental rate increasers ranging from 2.00% to 5.94% in our Triple-net portfolio. Our Triple-net operators are experiencing similar impacts on occupancy and operating costs due to the COVID-19 pandemic as described above with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. However, long-term/post-acute facilities have generally experienced a higher degree of occupancy declines, which  in some cases impacted the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us. However, many of our Triple-net operators received funds under the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program and Provider Relief Fund. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected approximately 94% of rent due from operators under Triple-net lease agreements (primarily seniors housing and post-acute care facilities). No significant deferrals or rent concessions have been made. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable.\nDepreciation and amortization fluctuate as a result of the acquisitions, dispositions and transitions of triple-net properties. To the extent we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, our provision for depreciation and amortization will change accordingly.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a provision for loan losses under the current expected credit losses accounting standard, primarily related to the initial recognition of the £540 million of senior loan financings to affiliates of Safanad as part of the recapitalization of its investment in HC-One Group during the second quarter. The increase to interest income is primarily driven by interest recognized on this loan funding. Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized a provision for loan losses of $90,563,000, of which $80,873,000 represents additional reserves as a result of the current collateral estimate related to the Genesis outstanding loans.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded impairment charges of $26,579,000 related to four held for sale or sold properties and two held for use properties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recorded impairment charges of $34,867,000 related to one held for sale and four held for use properties. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs from acquisitions and segment transitions. Changes in the gain on sales of properties are related to the volume and timing of property sales and the sales prices.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed one Triple-net construction project representing $22,990,000 or $280,366 per unit. The following is a summary of our consolidated Triple-net construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net is primarily attributable to the mark-to-market of the equity warrants received as part of the Safanad/HC-One transaction that closed in the second quarter. In addition, the mark-to-market adjustment on our Genesis available-for-sale investment is reflected in all periods.\nInterest expense represents secured debt interest expense and related fees. The change in secured debt interest expense is due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, segment transitions, fluctuations in foreign currency rates, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The following is a summary of our Triple-net secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n58\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nA portion of our Triple-net properties were formed through partnerships. Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. The increase in income from unconsolidated entities during the year ended December 31, 2021 is primarily related to the reserves established on straight-line rent receivable balances at unconsolidated Genesis entities in the prior year. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.\nOutpatient Medical\nThe following is a summary of our SSNOI at Welltower Share for the Outpatient Medical segment (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nRel\nates to 350 properties for the QTD Pool and 331\nproperties for the YTD Pool. Please see Non-GAAP Financial Measures for additional information and reconciliations.\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the Outpatient Medical segment for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\n59\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRental income has decreased due primarily to significant dispositions that closed during 2020. Certain of our leases contain annual rental escalators that are contingent upon changes in the Consumer Price Index. These escalators are not fixed, so no straight-line rent is recorded; however, rental income is recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. If the Consumer Price Index does not increase, a portion of our revenues may not continue to increase. Our leases could renew above or below current rental rates, resulting in an increase or decrease in rental income. For the three months ended December 31, 2021, our consolidated Outpatient Medical portfolio signed 143,266 square feet of new leases and 203,285 square feet of renewals. The weighted-average term of these leases wa\ns seven y\nears, with a rate of $36.65 per square foot and tenant improvement and lease commission costs of $51.78 per square foot. Substantially all of these leases contain an annual fixed or contingent escalation rent structure ranging from 1.0% to 10.0%.\nWe have collected virtually all rent due through the year ended December 31, 2021, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with COVID-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable.\nThe increase in interest income for the year ended December 31, 2021 is due primarily to a $178,207,000 first mortgage initiated in August 2020, which was subsequently repaid in full in June of 2021, resulting in the reversal of the previously established allowance for credit losses.\nThe fluctuation in property operating expenses and depreciation and amortization are primarily attributable to the significant dispositions that occurred in 2020. To the extent that we acquire or dispose of additional properties in the future, these amounts will change accordingly. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized an impairment charge of $2,211,000 related to one held for sale property. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price. The fluctuation in other expenses is primarily due to noncapitalizable transaction costs. Changes in gains/losses on sales of properties are related to volume of property sales and the sales prices.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we completed three Outpatient Medical construction projects representing $125,179,000 or $605 per square foot. The following is a summary of our consolidated Outpatient Medical construction projects, excluding expansions, pending as of December 31, 2021 (dollars in thousands):\nTotal interest expense represents secured debt interest expense. The change in secured debt interest expense is primarily due to the net effect and timing of assumptions, extinguishments and principal amortizations. The following is a summary of our Outpatient Medical secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nA portion of our Outpatient Medical properties were formed through partnerships. Income or loss from unconsolidated entities represents our share of net income or losses from partnerships where we are the noncontrolling partner. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests represents our partners’ share of net income or loss relating to those partnerships where we are the controlling partner.\n60\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNon-Segment/Corporate\nThe following is a summary of our results of operations for the Non-Segment/Corporate activities for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nSee Non-GAAP Financial Measures below.\nProperty operating expenses represent insurance costs related to our captive insurance company formed as of July 1, 2020, which acts as a direct insurer of property level insurance coverage for our portfolio.\nThe following is a summary of our Non-Segment/Corporate interest expense for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nThe change in interest expense on senior unsecured notes is due to the net effect of issuances and extinguishments, as well as the movement in foreign exchange rates and related hedge activity. Please refer to Note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for additional information. The change in interest expense on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program is due primarily to the net effect and timing of draws, paydowns and variable interest rate changes. Please refer to Note 10 of our consolidated financial statements for additional information. Loan expenses represent the amortization of costs incurred in connection with senior unsecured notes issuances. The loss on extinguishment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 is due primarily to the early extinguishment of $339,128,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due March 2023 and $334,624,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due September 2023. The loss on extinguishment recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 is due primarily to the early extinguishment of $160,872,000 of our 3.75% senior unsecured notes due March 2023 and $265,376,000 of our 3.95% senior unsecured notes due September 2023.\nGeneral and administrative expenses as a percentage of consolidated revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were\n2.67%, 2.79%\nand 2.47%, respectively. Other expenses for all years include severance-related costs associated with the departure of certain executive officers and key employees. The provision for income taxes primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as TRSs.\nOther\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nWe believe that net income and net income attributable to common stockholders, as defined by U.S. GAAP, are the most appropriate earnings measurements. However, we consider FFO, NOI, SSNOI, EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA to be useful supplemental measures of our operating performance. Historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with U.S. GAAP implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time as evidenced by the provision for depreciation. However, since real estate values have historically risen or fallen with market conditions, many industry investors and analysts have considered presentations of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to\n61\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nbe insufficient. In response, the National Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts (“NAREIT”) created funds from operations attributable to common stockholders (“FFO”) as a supplemental measure of operating performance for REITs that excludes historical cost depreciation from net income. FFO, as defined by NAREIT, means NICS, computed in accordance with U.S. GAAP, excluding gains (or losses) from sales of real estate and impairment of depreciable assets, plus depreciation and amortization, and after adjustments for unconsolidated entities and noncontrolling interests.\nNOI is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. Property operating expenses represent costs associated with managing, maintaining and servicing tenants for our properties. These expenses include, but are not limited to, property-related payroll and benefits, property management fees paid to operators, marketing, housekeeping, food service, maintenance, utilities, property taxes and insurance. General and administrative expenses represent costs unrelated to property operations. These expenses include, but are not limited to, payroll and benefits, professional services, office expenses and depreciation of corporate fixed assets. Same store NOI (“SSNOI”) is used to evaluate the operating performance of our properties using a consistent population which controls for changes in the composition of our portfolio. We believe the drivers of property level NOI for both consolidated properties and unconsolidated properties are generally the same and therefore, we evaluate SSNOI based on our ownership interest in each property (\"Welltower Share\"). To arrive at Welltower's Share, NOI is adjusted by adding our minority ownership share related to unconsolidated properties and by subtracting the minority partners' noncontrolling ownership interests for consolidated properties. We do not control investments in unconsolidated properties and while we consider disclosures at Welltower Share to be useful, they may not accurately depict the legal and economic implications of our joint venture arrangements and should be used with caution. As used herein, same store is generally defined as those revenue-generating properties in the portfolio for the relevant year-over-year reporting periods. Acquisitions and development conversions are included in SSNOI five full quarters or eight full quarters after acquisition or being placed into service for the QTD Pool and the YTD Pool, respectively. Land parcels, loans and sub-leases, as well as any properties sold or classified as held for sale during the respective periods are excluded from SSNOI. Redeveloped properties (including major refurbishments of a Seniors Housing Operating property where 20% or more of units are simultaneously taken out of commission for 30 days or more or Outpatient Medical properties undergoing a change in intended use) are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the redevelopment for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. Properties undergoing operator transitions and/or segment transitions are also excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters post completion of the transition for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. In addition, properties significantly impacted by force majeure, acts of God, or other extraordinary adverse events are excluded from SSNOI until five full quarters or eight full quarters after the properties are placed back into service for the QTD Pool and YTD Pool, respectively. SSNOI excludes non-cash NOI and includes adjustments to present consistent ownership percentages and to translate Canadian properties and U.K. properties using a consistent exchange rate. We believe NOI and SSNOI provide investors relevant and useful information because they measure the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI and SSNOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.\nEBITDA is defined as earnings (net income) before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as EBITDA excluding unconsolidated entities and including adjustments for stock-based compensation expense, provision for loan losses, gains/losses on extinguishment of debt, gains/loss/impairments on properties, gains/losses on derivatives and financial instruments, other expenses, other impairment charges and other adjustments as deemed appropriate. We believe that EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA, along with net income, are important supplemental measures because they provide additional information to assess and evaluate the performance of our operations. We primarily use these measures to determine our interest coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by total interest, and our fixed charge coverage ratio, which represents EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA divided by fixed charges. Fixed charges include total interest and secured debt principal amortization. Covenants in our unsecured senior notes and primary credit facility contain financial ratios based on a definition of EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA that is specific to those agreements. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization and include book capitalization, undepreciated book capitalization and market capitalization. Book capitalization represents the sum of net debt (defined as total long-term debt, excluding operating lease liabilities, less cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash), total equity and redeemable noncontrolling interests. Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock.\nOur supplemental reporting measures and similarly entitled financial measures are widely used by investors, equity and debt analysts and rating agencies in the valuation, comparison, rating and investment recommendations of companies. Management uses these financial measures to facilitate internal and external comparisons to our historical operating results and in making operating decisions. Additionally, these measures are utilized by the Board of Directors to evaluate management. None of our supplemental measures represent net income or cash flow provided from operating activities as determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP and should not be considered as alternative measures of profitability or liquidity. Finally, the supplemental measures, as defined by us, may not be comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other real estate investment trusts or other companies.\n62\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe table below reflects the reconciliation of FFO to NICS, the most directly comparable U.S. GAAP measure, for the periods presented.

Undepreciated book capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for accumulated depreciation and amortization. Market capitalization represents book capitalization adjusted for the fair market value of our common stock. Our leverage ratios are defined as the proportion of net debt to total capitalization.

Management believes the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate and are not reasonably likely to change in the future. However, since these estimates require assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made, they bear the risk of change. If actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements, the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, liquidity and/or financial condition. Please refer to Note 2 to our consolidated financial statements for further information on significant accounting policies that impact us and for the impact of new accounting standards, including accounting pronouncements that were issued but not yet adopted by us.\n67\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe following table presents information about our critical accounting policies and estimates:\n68\nItem 7.\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\n69"

    "text": "We are exposed to various market risks, including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We seek to mitigate the underlying foreign currency exposures with gains and losses on derivative contracts hedging these exposures. We seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the terms of new investments with new long-term fixed rate borrowings to the extent possible. We may or may not elect to use financial derivative instruments to hedge interest rate exposure. These decisions are principally based on our policy to match our variable rate investments with comparable borrowings, but are also based on the general trend in interest rates at the applicable dates and our perception of the future volatility of interest rates. This section is presented to provide a discussion of the risks associated with potential fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. For more information, see Notes 12 and 17 to our consolidated financial statements.\nWe historically borrow on our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program to acquire, construct or make loans relating to health care and seniors housing properties. Then, as market conditions dictate, we will issue equity or long-term fixed rate debt to repay the borrowings under our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program. We are subject to risks associated with debt financing, including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness. The majority of our borrowings were completed under indentures or contractual agreements that limit the amount of indebtedness we may incur. Accordingly, in the event that we are unable to raise additional equity or borrow money because of these limitations, our ability to acquire additional properties may be limited.\nA change in interest rates will not affect the interest expense associated with our fixed rate debt. Interest rate changes, however, will affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt. Changes in the interest rate environment upon maturity of this fixed rate debt could have an effect on our future cash flows and earnings, depending on whether the debt is replaced with other fixed rate debt, variable rate debt or equity or repaid by the sale of assets. To illustrate the impact of changes in the interest rate markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our fixed rate debt instruments whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in interest rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value. The following table summarizes the analysis performed as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\nOur variable rate debt, including our unsecured revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, is reflected at fair value. At December 31, 2021, we had $1,742,268,000 outstanding related to our variable rate debt. Assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would result in increased annual interest expense of $17,423,000. At December 31, 2020, we had $2,241,909,000 outstanding under our variable rate debt. Assuming no changes in outstanding balances, a 1% increase in interest rates would have resulted in increased annual interest expense of $22,420,000.\nWe are subject to currency fluctuations that may, from time to time, affect our financial condition and results of operations. Increases or decreases in the value of the Canadian Dollar or British Pounds Sterling relative to the U.S. Dollar impact the amount of net income we earn from our investments in Canada and the United Kingdom. Based solely on our results for the year ended December 31, 2021, including the impact of existing hedging arrangements, if these exchange rates were to increase or decrease by 10%, our net income from these investments would increase or decrease, as applicable, by less than $11,000,000. We will continue to mitigate these underlying foreign currency exposures with non-U.S. denominated borrowings and gains and losses on derivative contracts. If we increase our international presence through investments in, or acquisitions or development of, seniors housing and health care properties outside the U.S., we may also decide to transact additional business or borrow funds in currencies other than U.S. Dollars, Canadian Dollars or British Pounds Sterling. To illustrate the impact of changes in foreign currency markets, we performed a sensitivity analysis on our derivative portfolio whereby we modeled the change in net present values arising from a hypothetical 1% increase in foreign currency exchange rates to determine the instruments’ change in fair value. The following table summarizes the results of the analysis performed (dollars in thousands):\n70"

    "text": "REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Welltower Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Welltower Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 16, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nImpairment of Real Property\nDescription of the Matter    At December 31, 2021, the Company’s net real property owned was approximately $30.7 billion. As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company reviews its real property quarterly on a property-by-property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the real property may be impaired. If the undiscounted cash flows indicate that the real property will not be recoverable, the carrying value of the real property is reduced to its estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value.\nAuditing the Company’s process to evaluate real property owned for impairment was complex due to the high degree of subjectivity in determining whether indicators of impairment were present for certain properties, and in determining the future undiscounted cash flows and estimated fair values, if necessary, of properties where indicators of impairment were determined to be present. In particular, the undiscounted cash flows and fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions, including future rental revenues and operating expenses, capitalization rates, and anticipated hold period, which are affected by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\n71\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to evaluate real property owned for impairment. This included testing controls over the Company’s review of impairment indicators by property and management's review and approval of the significant assumptions described above.\nTo test the Company's evaluation of real property for impairment, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used by management, evaluating the significant assumptions discussed above and testing the completeness and accuracy of the underlying data used by the Company in its analyses. We compared the significant assumptions used by management to current industry and economic trends and evaluated whether changes to the Company’s business and other relevant factors would affect the significant assumptions. In addition, we assessed the historical accuracy of the Company’s estimates and performed sensitivity analyses of the significant assumptions to evaluate the changes in the undiscounted future cash flows and estimated fair values of the property that would result from changes in the significant assumptions.\nReal Estate Acquisitions\nDescription of the Matter    During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed approximately $4.1 billion of real estate acquisitions. As disclosed in Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements, the total purchase price for all properties acquired has been allocated to the related real estate acquired (tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities) based upon their relative fair values.\nAuditing the fair values allocated by management to the real estate acquired was complex because the fair value estimates were sensitive to significant assumptions, including comparable land sales, capitalization rates, discount rates, market rental rates and property operating data, which can be impacted by expectations about future market or economic conditions.\nWe obtained an understanding, evaluated the design, and tested the operating effectiveness of controls over the Company’s process to account for real estate acquisitions, including controls over the Company’s review of the significant assumptions discussed above.\nTo test the fair values allocated to the real estate acquired, we performed audit procedures that included, among others, assessing the methodologies used by management and evaluating the significant assumptions used by the Company discussed above. We compared certain of management’s assumptions to external market data for similar properties and tested the clerical accuracy of the valuation models. We involved our valuation specialist in our evaluation of the significant assumptions used by the Company and the review of the valuation models.\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1970.\nToledo, Ohio\nFebruary 16, 2022\n72\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nWELLTOWER INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1.\nBusiness\nWelltower Inc., (the \"Company\") an S&P 500 company headquartered in Toledo, Ohio, is driving the transformation of health care infrastructure. The Company invests with leading seniors housing operators, post-acute providers and health systems to fund the real estate and infrastructure needed to scale innovative care delivery models and improve people’s wellness and overall health care experience. Welltower\n™\n, a real estate investment trust (“REIT”), owns interests in properties concentrated in major, high-growth markets in the United States (“U.S.”), Canada and the United Kingdom (“U.K.”), consisting of seniors housing and post-acute communities and outpatient medical properties.\n2.\nAccounting Policies and Related Matters\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”) requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nPrinciples of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and joint venture (“JV”) entities that we control, through voting rights or other means. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. At inception of JV transactions, we identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights (“variable interest entities” or “VIEs”) and determine which business enterprise is the primary beneficiary of its operations. A VIE is broadly defined as an entity where either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, do not have a controlling financial interest, or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. We consolidate investments in VIEs when we are determined to be the primary beneficiary. Accounting Standards Codification Topic 810, Consolidations (“ASC 810”), requires enterprises to perform a qualitative approach to determining whether or not a VIE will need to be consolidated. This evaluation is based on an enterprise’s ability to direct and influence the activities of a VIE that most significantly impact that entity’s economic performance. For investments in JVs, U.S. GAAP may preclude consolidation by the sole general partner in certain circumstances based on the type of rights held by the limited partner(s). We assess the limited partners’ rights and their impact on our consolidation conclusions, and we reassess if there is a change to the terms or in the exercisability of the rights of the limited partners, the sole general partner increases or decreases its ownership of limited partnership interests, or there is an increase or decrease in the number of outstanding limited partnership interests. We similarly evaluate the rights of managing members of limited liability companies.\nRevenue Recognition\nFor our Triple-net and Outpatient Medical segments, a significant source of our revenue is generated through leasing arrangements. Leases with fixed annual rental escalators are generally recognized on a straight-line basis over the initial lease period, subject to a collectability assessment. Rental income related to leases with contingent rental escalators is generally recorded based on the contractual cash rental payments due for the period. Leases in our Outpatient Medical portfolio typically include some form of operating expense reimbursement by the tenant. Certain payments made to operators are treated as lease incentives and amortized as a reduction of revenue over the lease term.\nFor our Seniors Housing Operating segment, revenue from resident fees and services is predominantly service-based, and generally is recognized monthly as services are provided. Agreements with residents generally have varying terms and are cancellable by the resident with\n30\ndays’ notice. Management contracts are present in some of our joint venture agreements to provide asset and property management, leasing, marketing and other services.\nOur Seniors Housing Operating segment contains continuing care retirement communities which operate as entrance fee communities. The entrance fee communities offer different contracts which vary in terms of how much of the entrance fee is considered to be refundable upon move-out, temporarily refundable until a period of time has passed, or nonrefundable. Refundable entrance fees are recorded as a payable within the accrued expenses and other liabilities line item of our Consolidated Balance Sheets.  Nonrefundable entrance fees are recorded as deferred revenue within the same line item and are recognized into revenue over the estimated remaining stay of the resident. We use a third party actuarial expert to determine the estimated remaining stay of each resident based on demographic data.\nInterest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding, subject to an evaluation of collectability risk.\nWe recognize gains on the disposition of real estate when the recognition criteria have been met, generally at the time the risks and rewards and title have transferred and we no longer have substantial continuing involvement with the real estate sold. We recognize losses from disposition of real estate when known.\n78\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of all highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less.\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash primarily consists of amounts held by lenders to provide future payments for real estate taxes, insurance, tenant and capital improvements, amounts held in escrow relating to transactions we are entitled to receive over a period of time as outlined in the escrow agreement and net proceeds from property sales that were executed as tax-deferred dispositions under Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) Section 1031.\nDeferred Loan Expenses\nDeferred loan expenses are costs incurred by us in connection with the issuance, assumption and amendments of debt arrangements. Deferred loan expenses related to debt instruments, excluding the primary unsecured credit facility, are recorded as a reduction of the related debt liability. Deferred loan expenses related to the primary unsecured credit facility are included in other assets. We amortize these costs over the term of the debt using the straight-line method, which approximates the effective interest method.\nInvestments in Unconsolidated Entities\nInvestments in entities that we do not consolidate but have the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies are reported under the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, our share of the investee’s earnings or losses is included in our consolidated results of operations. The initial carrying value of investments in unconsolidated entities is based on the amount paid to purchase the entity interest inclusive of transaction costs. To the extent that our cost basis is different from the basis reflected at the entity level, the basis difference is generally amortized over the lives of the related assets and liabilities, and such amortization is included in our share of equity in earnings of the entity. We evaluate our equity method investments for impairment based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the equity method investment to its carrying value. When we determine a decline in the estimated fair value of such an investment below its carrying value is other-than-temporary, an impairment is recorded.\nEquity Securities\nEquity securities are measured at fair value with gains and losses recognized in loss (gain) on derivatives and financial instruments, net in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nRedeemable Noncontrolling Interests\nCertain noncontrolling interests are redeemable at fair value. Accordingly, we record the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests at the greater of (i) the initial carrying amount, increased or decreased for the noncontrolling interest’s share of net income or loss and its share of other comprehensive income or loss, and dividends or (ii) the redemption value. If the interests are redeemable in the future, we accrete the carrying value to the redemption value over the period until expected redemption, currently a weighted-average period of approximately five years. In accordance with ASC 810, the redeemable noncontrolling interests are classified outside of permanent equity, as a mezzanine item, on the balance sheet. At December 31, 2021, the current redemption value of redeemable noncontrolling interests exceeded the carrying value of $\n401,294,000\nby $\n40,212,000\n.\nWe entered into certain DownREIT partnerships which give a real estate seller the ability to exchange its property on a tax deferred basis for equity membership interests (“OP units”). The OP units may be redeemed any time following the first anniversary of the date of issuance at the election of the holders for one share of our common stock per unit or, at our option, cash.\nReal Property Owned\nReal estate acquisitions are generally classified as asset acquisitions for which we record tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities at cost on a relative fair value basis. Liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. Tangible assets primarily consist of land, buildings and improvements.\nIdentifiable intangible assets and liabilities consist primarily of the above or below market component of in-place leases and the value associated with the presence of in-place leases. The value allocable to the above or below market component of the acquired in-place lease is determined based upon the present value (using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired leases) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term, and (ii) management’s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease. The amounts allocated to above market leases are included in acquired lease intangibles and below market leases are included in other liabilities on the balance sheet and are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases or lease-up period.\n79\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values and customer relationship values for in-place tenants based on management’s evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant’s lease and our overall relationship with that respective tenant. Characteristics considered by management in allocating these values include the nature and extent of our existing business relationships with the tenant, growth prospects for developing new business with the tenant, the tenant’s credit quality and expectations of lease renewals, among other factors. The total amount of other intangible assets acquired is further allocated to in-place lease values for in-place residents with such value representing (i) value associated with lost revenue related to tenant reimbursable operating costs that would be incurred in an assumed re-leasing period, and (ii) value associated with lost rental revenue from existing leases during an assumed re-leasing period. This intangible asset is amortized over the remaining life of the lease or the assumed re-leasing period.\nReal property developed by us is recorded at cost, including the capitalization of construction period interest. These properties are depreciated on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives which range from\n15\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and\n5\nto\n15\nyears for improvements. We consider costs incurred in conjunction with re-leasing properties, including tenant improvements and lease commissions, to represent the acquisition of productive assets and, accordingly, such costs are reflected as investment activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.\nThe net book value of long-lived assets is reviewed quarterly on a property by property basis to determine if facts and circumstances suggest that the assets may be impaired or that the depreciable life may need to be changed. We consider external factors relating to each asset and the existence of a master lease which may link the cash flows of an individual asset to a larger portfolio of assets leased to the same tenant. If these factors and the projected undiscounted cash flows of the assets over the remaining depreciation period indicate that the assets will not be recoverable, the carrying value is reduced to the estimated fair market value. In addition, we are exposed to the risks inherent in concentrating investments in real estate, and in particular, the seniors housing and health care industries. A downturn in the real estate industry could adversely affect the value of our properties and our ability to sell properties for a price or on terms acceptable to us. Additionally, properties that meet the held for sale criteria are recorded at the lesser of fair value less costs to sell or the carrying value.\nExpenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred.\nCapitalization of Construction Period Interest\nWe capitalize interest costs associated with funds used for the construction of properties owned by us. The amount capitalized is based upon the balance outstanding during the construction period using the rate of interest which approximates our company-wide cost of financing. Our interest expense reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income has been reduced by the amounts capitalized.\nLoans Receivable\nLoans receivable are recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets in real estate loans receivable, net of credit allowance, or for non-real estate loans receivable, in receivables and other assets. Real estate loans receivable consists of mortgage loans and other real estate loans which are primarily collateralized by a first, second or third mortgage lien, a leasehold mortgage on, or an assignment or pledge of the membership interest in, the related properties, corporate guarantees and/or personal guarantees. Non-real estate loans are generally corporate loans with no real estate backing. Interest income on loans is recognized as earned based upon the principal amount outstanding subject to an evaluation of the risk of credit loss.\nIn Substance Real Estate Investments\nWe provide loans to third parties for the acquisition, development and construction of real estate. Under these arrangements, it is possible that we will participate in the expected residual profits of the project through the sale, refinancing or acquisition of the property. We evaluate the characteristics of each arrangement, including its risks and rewards, to determine whether they are more similar to those associated with a loan or an investment in real estate. Arrangements with characteristics implying loan classification are presented as real estate loans receivable and result in the recognition of interest income. Arrangements with characteristics implying real estate joint ventures are treated as in substance real estate investments and presented as investments in unconsolidated entities and are accounted for using the equity method. The classification of each arrangement as either a real estate loan receivable or investment in unconsolidated entity involves judgment and relies on various factors, including market conditions, amount and timing of expected residual profits, credit enhancements in the form of guarantees, estimated fair value of the collateral, and significance of borrower equity in the project, among others. The classification of such arrangements is performed at inception, and periodically reassessed when significant changes occur in the circumstances or conditions described above.\n80\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAllowance for Credit Losses on Loans Receivable\nThe allowance for credit losses on loans receivable is maintained at a level believed adequate to absorb potential losses in our loans receivable. The determination of the credit allowance is based on a quarterly evaluation of all outstanding loans, including general economic conditions and estimated collectability of loan payments. We evaluate the collectability of our loans receivable based on a combination of credit quality indicators, including, but not limited to, payment status, historical loan charge-offs, financial strength of the borrower and guarantors, and nature, extent, and value of the underlying collateral. A loan is considered to have deteriorated credit quality when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due as scheduled according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement. For those loans we identified as having deteriorated credit quality, we determine the amount of credit loss on an individual basis. Placement on non-accrual status may be required. Consistent with this definition, all loans on non-accrual status are deemed to have deteriorated credit q\nuality. To the extent circumstances improve and the risk of collectability is diminished, we may return these loans to income accrual status. While a loan is on non-accrual status, any cash receipts are applied against the outstanding principal balance. For the remaining loans we assess credit loss on a collective pool basis and use our historical loss experience for similar loans to determine the reserve for credit losses.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is tested annually for impairment and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount, including goodwill, exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value and the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount of that goodwill. We have not had any goodwill impairments.\nFair Value of Derivative Instruments\nDerivatives are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet as assets or liabilities. The valuation of derivative instruments requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments. Fair values of our derivatives are estimated by pricing models that consider the forward yield curves and discount rates. The fair value of our forward exchange contracts are estimated by pricing models that consider foreign currency spot rates, forward trade rates and discount rates. Such amounts and the recognition of such amounts are subject to estimates that may change in the future. See Note 12 for additional information.\nAccrued Expenses and Other Liabilities\nAccrued expenses and other liabilitie\ns consist of the following (in thousands):\nFederal Income Tax\nWe have elected to be treated as a REIT under the applicable provisions of the IRC, commencing with our first taxable year, and made no provision for U.S. federal income tax purposes prior to our acquisition of our taxable REIT subsidiaries (“TRSs”). As a result of these as well as subsequent acquisitions, we now record income tax expense or benefit with respect to certain of our entities that are taxed as TRSs under provisions similar to those applicable to regular corporations and not under the REIT provisions. We account for deferred income taxes using the asset and liability method and recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. Under this method, we determine deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any increase or decrease in the deferred tax liability that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about expected future tax consequences of events, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. Deferred income taxes also reflect the impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. A valuation allowance is provided if we believe it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized. Any increase or decrease in the valuation allowance that results from a change in circumstances, and that causes a change in our judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset, is included in the tax provision when such changes occur. See Note 19 for additional information.\n81\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign Currency\nCertain of our subsidiaries’ functional currencies are the local currencies of their respective countries. We translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries into U.S. Dollars using average rates of exchange in effect during the period, and we translate balance sheet accounts using exchange rates in effect at the end of the period. We record resulting currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income, a component of stockholders’ equity, on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income available to common stockholders by the weighted-average number of shares outstanding for the period adjusted for non-vested shares of restricted stock. The computation of diluted earnings per share is similar to basic earnings per share, except that the number of shares is increased to include the number of additional common shares that would have been outstanding if the potentially dilutive common shares had been issued. Additionally, net income (loss) allocated to OP units (discussed above) has been included in the numerator and redeemable common stock related to the OP units have been included in the denominator for the purpose of computing diluted earnings per share.\nReclassifications\nC\nertain amounts in prior years have been reclassified to conform to current year presentation.\nImpact of COVID-19 Pandemic\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our operations and those of our operators and tenants will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted with confidence, including the scope, severity and duration of the pandemic, the actions taken to contain the pandemic or mitigate its impact, the direct and indirect economic effects of the pandemic and containment measures, the impact of new variants, the effectiveness of vaccines, the overall pace of recovery, among others. The COVID-19 pandemic could have material and adverse effects on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in the future.\nOur Seniors Housing Operating revenues are dependent on occupancy. Spot occupancy has steadily increased in recent months, with\n94\n% (unaudited) of communities open for new admissions and nearly all communities allowing visitors, in-person tours and communal dining and activities as of December 31, 2021. Rapid distribution and a high acceptance rate of COVID-19 vaccinations by residents within assisted living and memory care facilities in the U.S. and U.K. have resulted in a significant decrease in total resident case counts across the portfolio from peak levels in mid-January 2021, however, resident case counts have increased in December 2021 as a result of highly transmissible variants. As of December 31, 2021, occupancy has increased approximately\n510\nbasis points (\"bps\") to\n77.7\n% since the pandemic-low of\n72.6\n% on March 12, 2021 (unaudited).\nQuarterly spot occupancy rates through December 31, 2021 are as follows (unaudited):\n(1)\nSpot occupancy represents approximate month end occupancy at our share for\n546\nproperties in operation as of December 31, 2020, including unconsolidated properties but excluding acquisitions, executed dispositions, development conversions since this date as well as one property closed for redevelopment.\n(2)\nSequential occupancy changes are based on actual spot occupancy and may not recalculate due to rounding.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the U.S. and U.K. portfolios reported spot occupancy gains of approximately\n490\nbps and\n80\nbps, respectively. Canada reported a spot occupancy gain of approximately\n290\nbps (unaudited).\nOn March 27, 2020, the federal government enacted the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) to provide financial aid to individuals, businesses, and state and local governments. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we received government grants under the CARES Act primarily to cover increased expenses and lost revenue during the COVID-19 pandemic, as well as under similar programs in the U.K. and Canada. Grant income is recognized when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and the Company will comply with all conditions attached to the grant. Additionally, grants are recognized over the periods in which the Company recognizes the increased expenses and lost revenue the grants are intended to defray. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 we recognized $\n97,933,000\nand $\n31,927,000\n, respectively, of government grant income as a reduction to property operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Additionally, for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $\n4,642,000\nand $\n3,014,000\n, respectively, of government grant income in other income in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. The amount of qualifying expenditures and lost revenue exceeded grant income recognized and we believe we have complied and will continue to comply with all grant conditions.\n82\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nProperty-level operating expenses associated with the COVID-19 pandemic relating to our Seniors Housing Operating portfolio totaled $\n63,681,000\nand $\n110,719,000\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These expenses were incurred as a result of the introduction of public health measures and other regulations affecting our properties, as well as additional health and safety measures adopted by us and our operators related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including increases in labor and property cleaning expenses and expenditures related to our efforts to procure personal protective equipment (\"PPE\") and supplies. Certain new expenses incurred since the start of the pandemic may continue on an ongoing basis as part of new health and safety protocols.\nOur Triple-net operators have experienced similar occupancy declines and operating costs as described above with respect to our Seniors Housing Operating properties. Additionally, long-term/post-acute care facilities are generally experiencing a higher degree of occupancy declines. These factors may continue to impact the ability of our Triple-net operators to make contractual rent payments to us in the future. Many of our Triple-net operators received funds under the CARES Act Paycheck Protection Program and Provider Relief Fund.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we collected approximately\n94\n% of rent due from operators under Triple-net lease agreements (primarily seniors housing and post-acute care facilities). No significant rent deferrals or rent concessions have been made. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable. To the extent the prolonged impact of the COVID-19 pandemic causes operators or tenants to seek further modifications of their lease agreements, we may recognize reductions in revenue and increases in uncollectible receivables.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we have collected virtually all rent due from tenants in our Outpatient Medical portfolio, with uncollected amounts primarily attributable to local jurisdictions with COVID-19 related ordinances providing temporary rent relief to tenants. We evaluate leases individually and recognize rent on a cash basis if collectibility of substantially all contractual rent payments is not probable.\nNew Accounting Standards\n•\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, “Debt-Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging-Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40) Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity”. This ASU simplifies accounting for convertible instruments and removes certain settlement conditions that are required for equity contracts to qualify for the derivative scope exception. This ASU also simplifies the diluted earnings per share calculation in certain areas and provides updated disclosure requirements. The ASU is effective for public business entities beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. The adoption of this standard will not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.\n•\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued an amendment to the reference rate reform standard which provides the option for a limited period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for, or recognizing the effects of, reference rate reform on contract modifications and hedge accounting. An example of such reform is the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. Entities that make this optional expedient election would not have to remeasure the contracts at the modification date or reassess the accounting treatment if certain criteria are met and would continue applying hedge accounting for relationships affected by reference rate reform. The new standard was effective for us upon issuance and elections can be made through December 31, 2022. We are currently evaluating our options with regards to existing contracts and hedging relationships and the impact of adopting this update on our consolidated financial statements.\n3.\nReal Property Acquisitions and Development\nThe total purchase price for all properties acquired has been allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets and liabilities at cost on a relative fair value basis. Liabilities assumed and any associated noncontrolling interests are reflected at fair value. The results of operations for these acquisitions have been included in our consolidated results of operations since the date of acquisition and are a component of the appropriate segments. Transaction costs primarily represent costs incurred with acquisitions, including due diligence costs, fees for legal and valuation services, termination of pre-existing relationships computed based on the fair value of the assets acquired, lease termination fees and other acquisition-related costs. Transaction costs related to asset acquisitions are capitalized as a component of purchase price and all other non-capitalizable costs are reflected in other expenses on our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\n83\nWELLTOWER INC.

Atria Senior Living assumed operations of the portfolio following its acquisition of the Holiday Retirement management company pursuant to an incentive-based management agreement. As part of this transaction, a wholly owned subsidiary assumed the leasehold interest in a\n26\nproperty portfolio and subsequently purchased\neight\nof the leased properties from the landlord. The lease, identified as an operating lease, expires in 2035 and was recognized as a right of use asset, net of above market lease intangibles, and lease liability.\nConstruction Activity\nThe following is a summary of the construction projects that were placed into service and began generating revenues during the periods presented (in thousands):\n85\nWELLTOWER INC.

As most of our leases do not provide a rate implicit in the lease agreement, we generally use our incremental borrowing rate available at lease commencement, underlying collateral for the lease and the ability to borrow against that collateral on a secured basis to determine the present value of lease payments. The incremental borrowing rates were determined using our longer term borrowing rates (actual pricing through\n30\nyears, as well as other longer-term market rates).\nWe sublease certain real estate to a third party. Our sublease portfolio consists of a finance lease for\nseven\nbuildings which are subleased to a long-term/ post-acute care operator.\nThe components of lease expense were as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n(1)\nIncludes short-term leases which are immaterial\n.\n87\nWELLTOWER INC.

(\"Sunrise\"), who provides comprehensive property management and accounting services with respect to certain of our Seniors Housing Operating properties that Sunrise operates. We pay Sunrise annual management fees pursuant to long-term management agreements. The majority of our management agreements have initial terms expiring in 2028,\nplus, if applicable, optional renewal periods ranging from an additional\n3\nto\n15\nyears depending on the property. The management fees payable to Sunrise under the management agreements include\na fee based on a percentage of revenues generated by the applicable properties plus, if applicable, positive or negative adjustments based on\nspecified performance targets. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized fees to Sunrise of $\n37,052,000\n, $\n37,569,000\nand $\n41,200,000\n,\nrespectively, which are reflected within property operating expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nDuring the yea\nr ended December 31, 2019, we sold our interest in a Seniors Housing Operating joint venture and recognized a gain of $\n38,681,000\nin income (loss) from uncon\nsolidated entities in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nA\nt December 31, 2021, the ag\ngregate unamortized basis difference of our joint venture inve\nstments of $\n140,187,000\nis primarily attributable to the difference between the amount for which we purchased our interest in the entity, inclu\nding transaction costs, and the historical carrying value of the net assets of the joint venture. This difference is being amortized over the remaining useful life of the related properties and included in the reported amount of income from unconsolidated entities.\nWe have made loans related to\n12\nproperties a\ns of December 31, 2021 fo\nr the development and construction of certain properties which are classified as in substance real estate investments and have a carrying value of $\n317,647,000\n. We believe that such borrowers typically represent VIEs in accordance with ASC 810. VIEs are required to be consolidated by their primary beneficiary which is the enterprise that has both: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impacts the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of the VIE that could be significant to the entity. We have concluded that we are not the primary beneficiary of such borrowers, therefore, the loan arrangements were assessed based on among other factors, the amount and timing of expected residual profits, the estimated fair value of the collateral and the significance of the borrower’s equity in the project. Based on these assessments the arrangements have been classified as in substance real estate investments. We expect to fund an additional $\n86,644,000\nrelated to these investments.\n9.\nCredit Concentration\nWe use consolidated net operating income (“NOI”) as our credit concentration metric. See Note 18 for additional information and reconciliation.\nThe following table summarizes certain information about our credit concentration for the year ended December 31, 2021, excluding our share of NOI in unconsolidated entities (dollars in thousands):\n91\nWELLTOWER INC.

See Note 7 for further detail.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2021, we entered into definitive agreements to substantially exit our operating relationship with Genesis. The status of these transactions as of December 31, 2021 is as follows:\n•\nWe contributed\nnine\nTriple-net properties operated by Genesis into an\n80\n/\n20\njoint venture with ProMedica and such properties were added to the existing master lease with ProMedica.\n•\nOperations have transitioned to regional operators for\n39\nof the remaining\n42\nproperties, with the\nthree\nremaining properties expected to be transitioned at a later date.\n•\nWe entered into definitive agreements to sell the\n42\nformer Genesis properties to either a joint venture with Aurora Health Network, the new operator and us, or to sell outright. We have closed on the sale of\n25\nof these properties. An additional\nten\nproperties are classified as held for sale and the remaining\nseven\nproperties are expected to close simultaneously with our purchase option exercise in April 2023.\n•\nTo effectuate the transition of all\n51\nproperties, we agreed to provide Genesis a lease termination fee of $\n86\nmillion upon successful transition of all properties, which will be used to immediately repay indebtedness to us. The debt reduction associated with the lease termination fee was previously reserved as an allowance for credit losses on loans receivable.\n•\nAdditionally, upon achievement of certain restructuring milestones, we will reduce Genesis' indebtedness by an additional $\n170\nmillion in exchange for an equity interest in Genesis. Upon conclusion of the aforementioned loan transactions, Genesis will have $\n167\nmillion of indebtedness to us, exclusive of additional paid in kind interest, which will carry a maturity date of January 1, 2024. As of December 31, 2021, our total carrying value of Genesis loans receivable, net of allowances for credit losses, was $\n154,476,000\n.\n10.\nBorrowings Under Credit Facilities and Commercial Paper Program\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a primary unsecured credit facility with a consortium of\n34\nbanks that included a $\n4,000,000,000\nunsecured revolving credit facility, a $\n500,000,000\nunsecured term credit facility and a $\n250,000,000\nCanadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility. The unsecured revolving credit facility is comprised of a $\n1,000,000,000\ntranche that matures on June 4, 2023 (\nnone\noutstanding at December 31, 2021) and a $\n3,000,000,000\ntranche that matures on June 4, 2025 (none outstanding at December 31, 2021). Both tranches may be extended for two successive terms of six months at our option. The term credit facilities mature on July 19, 2023. We have an option, through an accordion feature, to upsize the unsecured revolving credit facility and the $\n500,000,000\nunsecured term credit facility by up to an additional $\n1,250,000,000\n, in the aggregate, and the $\n250,000,000\nCanadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility by up to an additional $\n250,000,000\n. The primary unsecured credit facility also allows us to borrow up to $\n1,000,000,000\nin alternate currencies (\nnone\noutstanding at December 31, 2021). Borrowings under the unsecured revolving credit facility are subject to interest payable at the applicable margin over LIBOR interest rate. The applicable margin is based on our debt ratings and was\n0.775\n% at December 31, 2021. In addition, we pay a facility fee quarterly to each bank based on the bank’s commitment amount. The facility fee depends on our debt ratings and was\n0.15\n% at December 31, 2021.\nIn January 2019, we established an unsecured commercial paper program. Under the terms of the program, we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes with maturities that vary, but do not exceed\n397\ndays from the date of issue, up to a maximum aggregate face or principal amount outstanding at any time of $\n1,000,000,000\n. As of December 31, 2021, there was a balance of $\n324,935,000\noutstanding on the commercial paper program ($\n325,000,000\nin principal outstanding, net of an unamortized discount of $\n65,000\n), which reduces the borrowing capacity of the unsecured revolving credit facility. The notes bear interest at floating rates with a weighted average of\n0.41\n% as of December 31, 2021 and a weighted average maturity of\n18\ndays as of  December 31, 2021.\n92\nWELLTOWER INC.

We may purchase senior notes for cash through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions, a tender offer or, in some cases, through the early redemption of such securities pursuant to their terms. The senior unsecured notes are redeemable at our option, at any time in whole or from time to time in part, at a redemption price equal to the sum of (i) the principal amount of the notes (or portion of such notes) being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon up to the redemption date and (ii) any “make-whole” amount due under the terms of the notes in connection with early redemptions. Redemptions and repurchases of debt, if any, will depend on prevailing market conditions, our liquidity requirements, contractual restrictions, and other factors.\nAt December 31, 2021, the annual principal payments due on these debt obligations were as follows (in thousands):\n(1)\nAmounts represent principal amounts due and do not include unamortized premiums/discounts, debt issuance costs, or other fair value adjustments as reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(2)\nAnnual interest rates range from\n0.80\n% to\n6.50\n%.\n(3)\nAnnual interest rates range from\n0.08\n% to\n6.67\n%. Carrying value of the properties securing the debt totaled $\n5,062,000,000\nat December 31, 2021.\n(4)\nIncludes a $\n250,000,000\nCanadian-denominated unsecured term credit facility (approximately $\n195,664,000\nbased on the Canadian/U.S. Dollar exchange rate on December 31, 2021). The loan matures on July 19, 2023 and bears interest at the Canadian Dealer Offered Rate plus\n0.9\n% (\n1.34\n% at December 31, 2021).\n(5)\nIncludes a $\n500,000,000\nunsecured term credit facility. The loan matures on July 19, 2023 and bears interest at LIBOR plus\n0.9\n% (\n1.00\n% at December 31, 2021).\n(6)\nIncludes a $\n300,000,000\nCanadian-denominated\n2.95\n% senior unsecured notes due 2027 (approximately $\n234,797,000\nbased on the Canadian/U.S. Dollar exchange rate on December 31, 2021).\n(7)\nIncludes a £\n550,000,000\n4.80\n% senior unsecured notes due 2028 (approximately $\n742,500,000\nbased on the Pounds Sterling/U.S. Dollar exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2021).\n(8)\nIncludes a £\n500,000,000\n4.50\n% senior unsecured notes due 2034 (approximately $\n675,000,000\nbased on the Pounds Sterling/U.S. Dollar exchange rate in effect on December 31, 2021).\nThe following is a summary of our senior unsecured notes principal activity during the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n93\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following is a summary of our secured debt principal activity for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\nOur debt agreements contain various covenants, restrictions and events of default. Certain agreements require us to maintain certain financial ratios and minimum net worth and impose certain limits on our ability to incur indebtedness, create liens and make investments or acquisitions. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance in all material respects with all of the covenants under our debt agreements.\n12.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe are exposed to, among other risks, the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our non-U.S. investments and interest rate risk related to our capital structure. Our risk management program is designed to manage the exposure and volatility arising from these risks, and utilizes foreign currency forward contracts, cross currency swap contracts, interest rate swaps, interest rate locks and debt issued in foreign currencies to offset a portion of these risks.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts Designated as Cash Flow Hedges\nFor instruments that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is deferred as a component of other comprehensive income (“OCI”) and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods, during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. Gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings.\nCash Flow Hedges of Interest Rate Risk\nWe enter into interest rate swaps in order to maintain a capital structure containing targeted amounts of fixed and floating-rate debt and manage interest rate risk. Interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges involve the receipt of variable amounts from a counterparty in exchange for our fixed-rate payments. These interest rate swap agreements were used to hedge the variable cash flows associated with variable-rate debt.\nPeriodically, we enter into and designate interest rate locks to partially hedge the risk of changes in interest payments attributable to increases in the bench\nmark interest rate during the period leading up to the probable issuance of fixed-rate debt. We designate our interest rate locks as cash flow hedges. Gains and losses when we settle our interest rate locks are amortized into income over the life of the related debt, except where a material amount is deemed to be ineffective, which would be immediately reclassified to the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income. Approximately $\n2,562,000\nof losses, which are included in OCI, are expected to be reclassified into earnings in the next 12 months.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts and Cross Currency Swap Contracts Designated as Net Investment Hedges\nWe use foreign currency forward and cross currency forward swap contracts to hedge a portion of the net investment in foreign subsidiaries against fluctuations in foreign exchange rates. For instruments that are designated and qualify as net investment hedges, the variability in the foreign currency to U.S. Dollar of the instrument is recorded as a cumulative translation adjustment component of OCI.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 we settled certain net investment hedges generating cash proceeds of $\n14,505,000\n, necessitating cash payments of $\n1,988,000\n, and generating cash proceeds of $\n6,716,000\n, respectively. The balance of the cumulative translation adjustment will be reclassified to earnings if the hedged investment is sold or substantially liquidated.\nDerivative Contracts Undesignated\nWe use foreign currency exchange contracts to manage existing exposures to foreign currency exchange risk. Gains and losses resulting from the changes in fair value of these instruments are recorded in interest expense on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income, and are substantially offset by net revaluation impacts on foreign currency denominated\n94\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nbalance sheet exposures. In addition, we have several interest rate cap contracts related to variable rate secured debt agreements. Gains and losses resulting from the changes in fair values of these instruments are also recorded in interest expense.\nEquity Warrants\nWe received equity warrants through our lending activities further described in Note 7, which were accounted for as loan origination fees. The warrants provide us the right to participate in the capital appreciation of the underlying company above a designated price upon liquidation and contain net settlement terms qualifying as derivatives under ASC Topic 815. The warrants are classified within receivables and other assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. These warrants are measured at fair value with changes in fair value being recognized within gain (loss) on derivatives and financial instruments in our Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income.\nThe following presents the notional amount of derivatives and other financial instruments as of the dates indicated (in thousands):\n(1)\nAt December 31, 2021 the maximum maturity date was November 1, 2023.\nThe following presents the impact of derivative instruments on the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the periods presented (in thousands):\n13.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nAt December 31, 2021, we had\n15\noutstanding letter of credit obligations totaling $\n34,744,000\nand expiring during 2022. At December 31, 2021, we had outstanding construction in progress of $\n651,389,000\nand were committed to providing additional funds of approximately $\n1,208,913,000\nto complete construction.

Under this authorization, we are not required to purchase shares but may choose to do so in the open market or through private transactions at times and amounts based on our evaluation of market conditions and other factors. We expect to finance any share repurchases under the Repurchase Program using available cash and may use proceeds from borrowings or debt offerings. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased\n201,947\nshares at an average price of $\n37.89\nper share.

Our non-employee directors, officers and key employees are eligible to participate in the 2016 Plan. The 2016 Plan allows for the issuance of, among other things, stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, deferred stock units, performance units, and dividend equivalent rights. Vesting periods for options, deferred stock units and restricted shares generally range from\nthree\nto\nfive years\n. Options expire\nten years\nfrom the date of grant.\nUnder our long-term incentive plan, certain restricted stock awards are market, performance and time-based. For market and performance based awards, we will grant a target number of restricted stock units, with the ultimate award determined by the total shareholder return and operating performance metrics, measured in each case over a measurement period of\nthree years\n. Thes\ne award\ns vest after the end of the performance periods. The expected term represents the period from the grant date to the end of the performance period. Compensation expense for these performance grants is measured based on the probability of achievement of certain performance goals and is recognized over the performance period. For the portion of the grant for which the award is determined by the operating performance metrics, the compensation cost is based on the grant date closing price and management’s estimate of corporate achievement of the financial metrics. If the estimated number of performance based restricted stock to be earned changes, an adjustment will be recorded to recognize the accumulated difference between the revised and previous estimates. For the portion of the grant determined by the total shareholder return, management used a Monte Carlo model to assess the fair value and compensation cost.

These awards vest over\ntwo years\nafter the end of the performance period, with a portion vesting immediately at the end of the performance period. Compensation expense is measured based on the probability of achievement of the performance goal and is recognized over both the performance period and vesting period. At December 31, 2021, the performance goal is not probable of being achieved.\nRestricted Stock\nThe fair value of the restricted stock is equal to the market price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant and is amortized over the vesting periods. As of December 31, 2021, there was $\n22,055,000\nof total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock that is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\ntwo years\n.\nThe following table summarizes information about non-vested restricted stock incentive awards as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nDefined Contribution Plan\nWe sponsor a 401(k) plan which is available to substantially all U.S. employees. We match a percentage of employee contributions up to\n5\n% of an employee's wages and provide a discretionary profit sharing contribution calculated as a percentage of eligible compensation. We recognized expense of $\n3,477,000\n, $\n3,323,000\nand $\n2,975,000\nduring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, related to this plan.\n16.\nEarnings Per Share\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in thousands, except per share data):\n98\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2019, outstanding forward sales agreements for the sale of\n5,187,250\nshares and\n4,935,804\nshares, respectively, were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because such forward sales were anti-dilutive for the period. Employee stock options were anti-dilutive for the periods presented.\n17.\nDisclosure about Fair Value of Financial Instruments\nFair value is defined as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability (an exit price) in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date. A three-level valuation hierarchy exists for disclosures of fair value measurements based upon the transparency of inputs to the valuation of an asset or liability as of the measurement date. A financial instrument's categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement. The three levels are defined below:\n•\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 2 - Observable inputs other than Level 1 prices such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities, quoted prices in markets that are not active, or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.\n•\nLevel 3 - Unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that value:\nMortgage Loans, Other Real Estate Loans and Non-real Estate Loans Receivable\n— The fair value of mortgage loans, other real estate loans and non-real estate loans receivable is generally estimated by using Level 2 and Level 3 inputs such as discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities.\nCash and Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\n— The carrying amount approximates fair value.\nEquity Securities\n— Equity securities are recorded at their fair value based on Level 1 publicly available trading prices.\nEquity Warrants\n— The fair value of equity warrants is estimated using Level 3 inputs and includes data points such as enterprise value of the underlying HC-One Group real estate portfolio, marketability discount for private company warrants, dividend yield, volatility and risk-free rate. The enterprise value is driven by projected cash flows, weighted average cost of capital and a terminal capitalization rate.\nBorrowings Under Primary Unsecured Credit Facility and Commercial Paper Program\n— The carrying amount of the primary unsecured credit facility and commercial paper program approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable.\n99\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nSenior Unsecured Notes\n— The fair value of the senior unsecured notes payable was estimated based on Level 1 publicly available trading prices. The carrying amount of the variable rate senior unsecured notes approximates fair value because they are interest rate adjustable.\nSecured Debt\n— The fair value of fixed rate secured debt is estimated using Level 2 inputs by discounting the estimated future cash flows using the current rates at which similar loans would be made with similar credit ratings and for the same remaining maturities. The carrying amount of variable rate secured debt approximates fair value because the borrowings are interest rate adjustable.\nForeign Currency Forward Contracts, Interest Rate Swaps and Cross Currency Swaps\n— Foreign currency forward contracts, interest rate swaps and cross currency swaps are recorded in other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet at fair value that is derived from observable market data, including yield curves and foreign exchange rates.\nRedeemable OP Unitholder Interests\n— Our redeemable OP unitholder interests are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value using Level 2 inputs unless the fair value is below the initial amount, in which case the redeemable OP unitholder interests are recorded at the initial amount adjusted for distributions to the unitholders and income or loss attributable to the unitholders. The fair value is measured using the closing price of our common stock, as units may be redeemed at the election of the holder for cash or, at our option, one share of our common stock per unit, subject to adjustment in certain circumstances.\nThe carrying amounts and estimated fair values of our financial instruments are as follows (in thousands):\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nThe market approach is utilized to measure fair value for our financial assets and liabilities reported at fair value on a recurring basis. The market approach uses prices and other relevant information generated by market transactions involving identical or comparable assets or liabilities.\nThe following summarizes items measured at fair value on a recurring basis (in thousands):\n(1)\nPlease see Note 12 for additional information.\nThe following table summarizes the change in fair value for equity warrants using unobservable Level 3 inputs for the year ended December 31, 2021 (in thousands):\n100\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the valuation of the equity warrants are the cash flows of the underlying HC-One Group enterprise, as well as the terminal capitalization rate of\n9.5\n%.\nItems Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\nIn addition to items that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis, we also have assets and liabilities in our balance sheet that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that are not included in the tables above. Assets, liabilities and noncontrolling interests that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis include those acquired or assumed. Asset impairments (if applicable, see Note 5 for impairments of real property and Note 7 for impairments of loans receivable) are also measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. We have determined that the fair value measurements included in each of these assets and liabilities rely primarily on company-specific inputs and our assumptions about the use of the assets and settlement of liabilities, as observable inputs are not available. As such, we have determined that each of these fair value measurements generally resides within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. We estimate the fair value of real estate and related intangibles using the income approach and unobservable data such as net operating income and estimated capitalization and discount rates. We also consider local and national industry market data including comparable sales, and commonly engage an external real estate appraiser to assist us in our estimation of fair value. We estimate the fair value of assets held for sale based on current sales price expectations or, in the absence of such price expectations, Level 3 inputs described above. We estimate the fair value of loans receivable using projected payoff valuations based on the expected future cash flows and/or the estimated fair value of collateral, net of sales costs, if the repayment of the loan is expected to be provided solely by the collateral. We estimate the fair value of secured debt assumed in asset acquisitions using current interest rates at which similar borrowings could be obtained on the transaction date.\n18.\nSegment Reporting\nWe invest in seniors housing and health care real estate.\nWe evaluate our business and make resource allocations on our\nthree\noperating segments: Seniors Housing Operating, Triple-net and Outpatient Medical. Our Seniors Housing Operating properties include seniors apartments, assisted living, independent living/continuing care retirement communities, independent supportive living communities (Canada), care homes with and without nursing (U.K.) and combinations thereof that are owned and/or operated through RIDEA structures (see Note 19). Our Triple-net properties include the property types described above as well as long-term/post-acute care facilities. Under the Triple-net segment, we invest in seniors housing and health care real estate through acquisition and financing of primarily single tenant properties. Properties acquired are primarily leased under triple-net leases and we are not involved in the management of the property. Our Outpatient Medical properties are typically leased to multiple tenants and generally require a certain level of property management by us.\nWe evaluate performance based upon consolidated NOI of each segment. We define NOI as total revenues, including tenant reimbursements, less property operating expenses. We believe NOI provides investors relevant and useful information as it measures the operating performance of our properties at the property level on an unleveraged basis. We use NOI to make decisions about resource allocations and to assess the property level performance of our properties.\nNon-segment revenue consists mainly of interest income on cash investments recorded in other income. Non-segment assets consist of corporate assets including cash, deferred loan expenses and corporate offices and equipment among others. Non-property specific revenues and expenses are not allocated to individual segments in determining NOI.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant accounting policies (see Note 2). The results of operations for all acquisitions described in Note 3 are included in our consolidated results of operations from the acquisition dates and are components of the appropriate segments. All inter-segment transactions are eliminated.\nSummary information for the reportable segments (which excludes unconsolidated entities) during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in thousands):\n101\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n102\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n103\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur portfolio of properties and other investments are located in the United States, the United Kingdom and Canada. Revenues and assets are attributed to the country in which the property is physically located.\nThe following is a summary of geographic information for the periods presented (dollars in thousands):\n(1)\nThe United States, United Kingdom and Canada represent\n75\n%,\n12\n% and\n13\n%, respectively, of our resident fees and services revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n104\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n19.\nIncome Taxes and Distributions\nWe elected to be taxed as a REIT commencing with our first taxable year. To qualify as a REIT for federal income tax purposes, at least 90% of taxable income (excluding 100% of net capital gains) must be distributed to stockholders. REITs that do not distribute a certain amount of taxable income in the current year are also subject to a 4% federal excise tax. The main differences between undistributed net income for federal income tax purposes and financial statement purposes are the recognition of straight-line rent for reporting purposes, basis differences in acquisitions, recording of impairments, differing useful lives and depreciation and amortization methods for real property and the provision for loan losses for reporting purposes versus bad debt expense for tax purposes.\nCash distributions paid to common stockholders, for federal income tax purposes, are as follows for the periods presented:\n(1)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, includes Section 199A dividends of $\n1.4828\n, $\n1.6389\nand $\n2.6937\nrespectively.\n(2)\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, includes Unrecaptured Section 1250 Gains of $\n0.4523\n, $\n0.3458\nand $\n0.2835\n, respectively.\nOur consolidated provision for income tax expense (benefit) is as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nREITs generally are not subject to U.S. federal income taxes on that portion of REIT taxable income or capital gain that is distributed to stockholders. For the tax year ended December 31, 2021, as a result of ownership of investments in Canada and the U.K., we were subject to foreign income taxes under the respective tax laws of these jurisdictions.\nThe provision for income taxes for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relates to state taxes, foreign taxes, and taxes based on income generated by entities that are structured as TRSs. For the tax years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the foreign tax provision/(benefit) amount included in the consolidated provision for income taxes was $\n6,787,000\n, $\n5,777,000\nand $(\n3,892,000\n), respectively.\nA reconciliation of income taxes, which is computed by applying the federal corporate tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, to the income tax expense/(benefit) is as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n(1)\nExcluding purchase price accounting.\nEach TRS and foreign entity subject to income taxes is a tax paying component for purposes of classifying deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nThe tax effects of taxable and deductible temporary differences, as well as tax asset/(liability) attributes, are summarized as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\n105\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOn the basis of the evaluations performed as required by the codification, valuation allowances totaling $\n264,321,000\nwere recorded on U.S. taxable REIT subsidiaries as well as entities in other jurisdictions to limit the deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not realizable. However, the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted if (i) estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward period are reduced or increased or (ii) objective negative evidence in the form of cumulative losses is no longer present (and additional weight may be given to subjective evidence such as our projections for growth).\nThe valuation allowance rollforward is summarized as follows for the periods presented (in thousands):\nAs a result of certain acquisitions, we are subject to corporate level taxes for any related asset dispositions that may occur during the five-year period immediately after such assets were owned by a C corporation (“built-in gains tax”). The amount of income potentially subject to this special corporate level tax is generally equal to the lesser of (i) the excess of the fair value of the asset over its adjusted tax basis as of the date it became a REIT asset, or (ii) the actual amount of gain. Some but not all gains recognized during this period of time could be offset by available net operating losses and capital loss carryforwards. During the year ended December 31, 2017, we acquired certain additional assets with built-in gains as of the date of acquisition that could be subject to the built-in gains tax if disposed of prior to the expiration of the applicable five-year period. We have not recorded a deferred tax liability as a result of the potential built-in gains tax based on our intentions with respect to such properties and available tax planning strategies.\nGiven the applicable statute of limitations, we generally are subject to audit by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) for the year ended December 31, 2018 and subsequent years. The statute of limitations may vary in the states in which we own properties or conduct business. We do not expect to be subject to audit by state taxing authorities for any year prior to the year ended December 31, 2017. We are also subject to audit by the Canada Revenue Agency and provincial authorities generally for periods subsequent to May 2017 related to entities acquired or formed in connection with acquisitions, and by the U.K.’s HM Revenue & Customs for periods subsequent to August 2015 related to entities acquired or formed in connection with acquisitions.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had a net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforward related to the REIT of $\n340,827,000\n. In addition, we completed the acquisition of Holiday Retirement, which included NOLs of $\n382,399,000\n. Due to our uncertainty regarding the realization of certain deferred tax assets, we have not recorded a deferred tax asset related to NOLs generated by the REIT. These amounts can be used to offset future taxable income (and/or taxable income for prior years if an audit determines that tax is owed), if any. The REIT will be entitled to utilize NOLs and tax credit carryforwards only to the extent that REIT taxable income exceeds our deduction for dividends paid. The NOL carryforwards generated through December 31, 2017 will expire through 2037. Beginning with the tax years after December 31, 2017, the law eliminates the NOL carryback period for REITs, replaces the 20-year NOL carryforward period with an indefinite carryforward period and, with respect to tax years beginning after 2020, limits the use of NOLs to 80% of taxable income.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an NOL carryforward related to Canadian entities of $\n316,821,000\nand $\n262,345,000\nrespectively. These Canadian losses have a 20-year carryforward period. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had an NOL carryforward related to U.K. entities of $\n193,998,000\nand $\n207,085,000\nrespectively. These U.K. losses do not have a finite carryforward period.\n106\nWELLTOWER INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n20.\nVariable Interest Entities\nWe have entered into joint ventures to own certain seniors housing and outpatient medical assets which are deemed to be VIEs. We have concluded that we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs based on a combination of operational control of the joint venture and the rights to receive residual returns or the obligation to absorb losses arising from the joint ventures. Except for capital contributions associated with the initial joint venture formations, the joint ventures have been and are expected to be funded from the ongoing operations of the underlying properties.\nAccordingly, such joint ventures have been consolidated, and the table below summarizes the balance sheets of consolidated VIEs in the aggregate (in thousands):\n(1)\nNote that assets of the consolidated VIEs can only be used to settle obligations relating to such VIEs. Liabilities of the consolidated VIEs represent claims against the specific assets of the VIEs.\n107"

Based on that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of the end of the period covered by this report.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the criteria established by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) in a report entitled Internal Control — Integrated Framework.\nBased on this assessment, using the criteria above, management concluded that the Company’s system of internal control over financial reporting was effective as of December 31, 2021.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm of Ernst & Young LLP, as auditors of the Company’s consolidated financial statements, has issued an attestation report on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nNo change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) occurred during the fourth quarter of the one-year period covered by this report that materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\n108\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Welltower Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Welltower Inc. and subsidiaries’ internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Welltower Inc. and subsidiaries (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Welltower Inc. and subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedules listed in the index at Item 15(a) and our report dated February 16, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/  Ernst & Young LLP\nToledo, Ohio\nFebruary 16, 2022\n109"
