    "text": "DUKE ENERGY\nGeneral\nDuke Energy was incorporated on May 3, 2005, and is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also Subsidiary Registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants electronically file reports with the SEC, including Annual Reports on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, proxy statements and amendments to such reports.\nThe SEC maintains an internet site that contains reports, proxy and information statements and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at sec.gov. Additionally, information about the Duke Energy Registrants, including reports filed with the SEC, is available through Duke Energy’s website at duke-energy.com. Such reports are accessible at no charge and are made available as soon as reasonably practicable after such material is filed with or furnished to the SEC.\nBusiness Segments\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes three reportable business segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. Duke Energy's chief operating decision-maker routinely reviews financial information about each of these business segments in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. For additional information on each of these business segments, including financial and geographic information, see Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments.” The following sections describe the business and operations of each of Duke Energy’s business segments, as well as Other.\nELECTRIC UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Indiana and Duke Energy Ohio. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure provides retail electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity to approximately 8.2 million customers within the Southeast and Midwest regions of the U.S. The service territory is approximately 91,000 square miles across six states with a total estimated population of 26 million. The operations include electricity sold wholesale to municipalities, electric cooperative utilities and other load-serving entities.\nDuring 2021, Duke Energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a 19.9% minority interest issued by Duke Energy Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction will be completed following two closings. The first closing occurred on September 8, 2021, and resulted in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC issuing 11.05% of its membership interest to the affiliate of GIC. The second closing is expected to occur no later than January 2023. See Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,\" for additional information. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is also a joint owner in certain electric transmission projects. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has a 50% ownership interest in DATC, a partnership with American Transmission Company, formed to design, build and operate transmission infrastructure. DATC owns 72% of the transmission service rights to Path 15, an 84-mile transmission line in central California. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure also has a 50% ownership interest in Pioneer, which builds, owns and operates electric transmission facilities in North America. The following map shows the service territory for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure as of December 31, 2021.\n9\nThe electric operations and investments in projects are subject to the rules and regulations of the FERC, the NRC, the NCUC, the PSCSC, the FPSC, the IURC, the PUCO and the KPSC.\nThe following table represents the distribution of GWh billed sales by customer class for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe number of residential and general service customers within the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time. Sales growth is expected within the service territory but continues to be impacted by adoption of energy efficiencies and self-generation. Residential sales increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to customer growth and the introduction of a hybrid work environment in response to multiple waves of COVID-19 during 2021. Meanwhile, sales for general service and industrial customers recovered in 2021 from temporary closings and ramp backs experienced in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the longer time frame, it is still expected that the continued adoption of more efficient housing and appliances will have a negative impact on average usage per residential customer over time.\nSeasonality and the Impact of Weather\nRevenues and costs are influenced by seasonal weather patterns. Peak sales of electricity occur during the summer and winter months, which results in higher revenue and cash flows during these periods. By contrast, lower sales of electricity occur during the spring and fall, allowing for scheduled plant maintenance. Residential and general service customers are more impacted by weather than industrial customers. Estimated weather impacts are based on actual current period weather compared to normal weather conditions. Normal weather conditions are defined as the long-term average of actual historical weather conditions.\nThe estimated impact of weather on earnings is based on the temperature variances from a normal condition and customers’ historic usage patterns. The methodology used to estimate the impact of weather does not consider all variables that may impact customer response to weather conditions such as humidity in the summer or wind chill in the winter. The precision of this estimate may also be impacted by applying long-term weather trends to shorter-term periods.\n10\nHeating degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature falls below a base temperature. Cooling degree days measure the variation in weather based on the extent the average daily temperature rises above the base temperature. Each degree of temperature below the base temperature counts as one heating degree day and each degree of temperature above the base temperature counts as one cooling degree day.\nCompetition\nRetail\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure’s businesses operate as the sole supplier of electricity within their service territories, with the exception of Ohio, which has a competitive electricity supply market for generation service. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to generate, transmit, distribute and sell electricity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable electricity at fair prices.\nIn Ohio, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure conducts competitive auctions for electricity supply. The cost of energy purchased through these auctions is recovered from retail customers. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin in Ohio on the transmission and distribution of electricity, but not on the cost of the underlying energy.\nCompetition in the regulated electric distribution business is primarily from the development and deployment of alternative energy sources including on-site generation from industrial customers and distributed generation, such as private solar, at residential, general service and/or industrial customer sites.\nWholesale\nDuke Energy competes with other utilities and merchant generators for bulk power sales, sales to municipalities and cooperatives and wholesale transactions under primarily cost-based contracts approved by FERC. The principal factors in competing for these sales are availability of capacity and power, reliability of service and price. Prices are influenced primarily by market conditions and fuel costs.\nIncreased competition in the wholesale electric utility industry and the availability of transmission access could affect Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s load forecasts, plans for power supply and wholesale energy sales and related revenues. Wholesale energy sales will be impacted by the extent to which additional generation is available to sell to the wholesale market and the ability of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to attract new customers and to retain existing customers.\nEnergy Capacity and Resources\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure owns approximately 50,259 MW of generation capacity. For additional information on owned generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”\nEnergy and capacity are also supplied through contracts with other generators and purchased on the open market. Factors that could cause Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to purchase power for its customers may include, but are not limited to, generating plant outages, extreme weather conditions, generation reliability, demand growth and price. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has interconnections and arrangements with its neighboring utilities to facilitate planning, emergency assistance, sale and purchase of capacity and energy and reliability of power supply.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure’s generation portfolio is a balanced mix of energy resources having different operating characteristics and fuel sources designed to provide energy at the lowest possible cost to meet its obligation to serve retail customers. All options, including owned generation resources and purchased power opportunities, are continually evaluated on a real-time basis to select and dispatch the lowest-cost resources available to meet system load requirements.\nSources of Electricity\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure relies principally on natural gas, nuclear fuel and coal for its generation of electricity. The following table lists sources of electricity and fuel costs for the three years ended December 31, 2021.\n(a)    Statistics related to all fuels reflect Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's public utility ownership interest in jointly owned generation facilities.\n(b)    Generating figures are net of output required to replenish pumped storage facilities during off-peak periods.\n11\nNatural Gas and Fuel Oil\nNatural gas and fuel oil supply, transportation and storage for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s generation fleet is purchased under standard industry agreements from various suppliers, including Piedmont. Natural gas supply agreements typically provide for a percentage of forecasted burns being procured over time, with varied expiration dates. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it has access to an adequate supply of natural gas and fuel oil for the reasonably foreseeable future.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has certain dual-fuel generating facilities that can operate utilizing both natural gas and fuel oil. The cost of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s natural gas and fuel oil is fixed price or determined by published market prices as reported in certain industry publications, plus any transportation and freight costs. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana use derivative instruments to manage a portion of their exposure to price fluctuations for natural gas. For Duke Energy Florida, there is currently an agreed-upon moratorium with the FPSC on future hedging of natural gas prices.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has firm interstate and intrastate natural gas transportation agreements and storage agreements in place to support generation needed for load requirements. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure may purchase additional shorter-term natural gas transportation and utilize natural gas interruptible transportation agreements to support generation needed for load requirements. The Electric Utilities and Infrastructure natural gas plants are served by various supply zones and multiple pipelines.\nNuclear\nThe industrial processes for producing nuclear generating fuel generally involve the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates and services to convert, enrich and fabricate fuel assemblies.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has contracted for uranium materials and services to fuel its nuclear reactors. Uranium concentrates, conversion services and enrichment services are primarily met through a diversified portfolio of long-term supply contracts. The contracts are diversified by supplier, country of origin and pricing. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure staggers its contracting so that its portfolio of long-term contracts covers the majority of its fuel requirements in the near term and decreasing portions of its fuel requirements over time thereafter. Near-term requirements not met by long-term supply contracts have been and are expected to be fulfilled with spot market purchases. Due to the technical complexities of changing suppliers of fuel fabrication services, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure generally source these services to a single domestic supplier on a plant-by-plant basis using multiyear contracts.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has entered into fuel contracts that cover 100% of its uranium concentrates and conversion services through at least 2022, 100% of its enrichment services through at least 2023, and 100% of its fabrication services requirements for these plants through at least 2027. For future requirements not already covered under long-term contracts, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it will be able to renew contracts as they expire or enter into similar contractual arrangements with other suppliers of nuclear fuel materials and services.\nCoal\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure meets its coal demand through a portfolio of long-term purchase contracts and short-term spot market purchase agreements. Large amounts of coal are purchased under long-term contracts with mining operators who mine both underground and at the surface. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses spot market purchases to meet coal requirements not met by long-term contracts. Expiration dates for its long-term contracts, which may have various price adjustment provisions and market reopeners, range from 2022 to 2026 for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and 2022 to 2025 for Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure expects to renew these contracts or enter into similar contracts with other suppliers as existing contracts expire, though prices will fluctuate over time as coal markets change. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure has an adequate supply of coal under contract to meet its risk management guidelines regarding projected future consumption. As a result of volatility in natural gas prices and the associated impacts on coal-fired dispatch within the generation fleet, coal inventories will continue to fluctuate. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure continues to actively manage its portfolio and has worked with suppliers to obtain increased flexibility in its coal contracts.\nCoal purchased for the Carolinas is primarily produced from mines in Central Appalachia, Northern Appalachia and the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Florida is primarily produced from mines in the Illinois Basin. Coal purchased for Kentucky is produced from mines along the Ohio River in Illinois, Ohio, West Virginia and Pennsylvania. Coal purchased for Indiana is primarily produced in Indiana and Illinois. There are adequate domestic coal reserves to serve Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's coal generation needs through end of life. The current average sulfur content of coal purchased by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure is between 1.5% and 2% for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, between 2.5% and 3% for Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana, and between 3% and 3.5% for Duke Energy Ohio. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure's environmental controls, in combination with the use of sulfur dioxide (SO\n2\n) emission allowances, enable Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to satisfy current SO\n2\nemission limitations for its existing facilities.\nPurchased Power\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure purchases a portion of its capacity and system requirements through purchase obligations, leases and purchase capacity contracts. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes it can obtain adequate purchased power capacity to meet future system load needs. However, during periods of high demand, the price and availability of purchased power may be significantly affected.\nThe following table summarizes purchased power for the previous three years:\n(a)    Represents approximately 14% of total system requirements for 2021, 13% for 2020 and 14% for 2019.\n(b)    For 2021, 2020 and 2019, these agreements include approximately 412 MW of firm capacity under contract by Duke Energy Florida with QFs.\n12\nInventory\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain an adequate stock of fuel and materials and supplies in order to ensure continuous operation of generating facilities and reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2021, the inventory balance for Electric Utilities and Infrastructure was approximately $3 billion. For additional information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”\nAsh Basin Management\nDuring 2015, EPA issued regulations related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and new and existing surface impoundments and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments (ash basins or impoundments) will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, such as the North Carolina Coal Ash Management Act of 2014 (Coal Ash Act).\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure has and will periodically submit to applicable authorities required site-specific coal ash impoundment remediation or closure plans. Closure plans must be approved and all associated permits issued before any work can begin. Closure activities have begun in all of Duke Energy's jurisdictions. Excavation began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or for reuse in an approved beneficial application. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high-priority North Carolina sites. At other sites where CCR management is required, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced.\nThe EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act leave the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of coal ash surface impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions. Duke Energy's electric utilities have included compliance costs associated with federal and state requirements in their respective rate proceedings. During 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress’ wholesale contracts were amended to include the recovery of expenditures related to AROs for the closure of coal ash basins. The amended contracts have retail disallowance parity or provisions limiting challenges to CCR cost recovery actions at FERC. FERC approved the amended wholesale rate schedules in 2017. For additional information on the ash basins and recovery, see Item 7, \"Other Matters\" and Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nNuclear Matters\nDuke Energy owns, wholly or partially, 11 operating nuclear reactors located at six operating stations. The Crystal River Unit 3 permanently ceased operation in February 2013. Nuclear insurance includes: nuclear liability coverage; property damage coverage; nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning coverage; and accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage. Joint owners reimburse Duke Energy for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance in accordance with joint owner agreements. The Price-Anderson Act requires plant owners to provide for public nuclear liability claims resulting from nuclear incidents to the maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $13.5 billion. For additional information on nuclear insurance, see Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Commitments and Contingencies.”\nDuke Energy has a significant future financial commitment to dispose of spent nuclear fuel and decommission and decontaminate each plant safely. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require Duke Energy to update their cost estimates for decommissioning their nuclear plants every five years.\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of NDTF investments and the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n(a)    Amounts for Progress Energy equal the sum of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.\n(b)    Decommissioning cost for Duke Energy Carolinas reflects its ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors.\n(c)    Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2018 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019. A new funding study was also completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019.\n(d)    Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2019 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in March 2020. Duke Energy Progress also completed a funding study, which was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in July 2020.\n(e)    During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,” for more information.\n13\nThe NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC have allowed Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to recover estimated decommissioning costs through retail and wholesale rates over the expected remaining service periods of their nuclear stations. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure believes the decommissioning costs being recovered through rates, when coupled with the existing fund balances and expected fund earnings, will be sufficient to provide for the cost of future decommissioning. For additional information, see Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations.”\nThe Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 (as amended) provides the framework for development by the federal government of interim storage and permanent disposal facilities for high-level radioactive waste materials. The government has not yet developed a storage facility or disposal capacity, so Electric Utilities and Infrastructure will continue to store spent fuel on its reactor sites.\nUnder federal law, the DOE is responsible for the selection and construction of a facility for the permanent disposal of spent nuclear fuel and high-level radioactive waste. The DOE terminated the project to license and develop a geologic repository at Yucca Mountain, Nevada in 2010, and is currently taking no action to fulfill its responsibilities to dispose of spent fuel.\nUntil the DOE begins to accept the spent nuclear fuel, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida will continue to safely manage their spent nuclear fuel. Under current regulatory guidelines, Harris has sufficient storage capacity in its spent fuel pools through the expiration of its renewed operating license. With certain modifications and approvals by the NRC to expand the on-site dry cask storage facilities, spent nuclear fuel dry storage facilities will be sufficient to provide storage space of spent fuel through the expiration of the operating licenses, including any license renewals, for Brunswick, Catawba, McGuire, Oconee and Robinson. Crystal River Unit 3 ceased operation in 2013 and was placed in a SAFSTOR condition in January 2018. As of January 2018, all spent fuel at Crystal River Unit 3 has been transferred from the spent fuel pool to dry storage at an on-site independent spent fuel storage installation. During 2020, the NRC and the FPSC approved an agreement to transfer ownership of spent fuel for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,” for more information.\nThe nuclear power industry faces uncertainties with respect to the cost and long-term availability of disposal sites for spent nuclear fuel and other radioactive waste, compliance with changing regulatory requirements, capital outlays for modifications and new plant construction.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the NRC for the design, construction and operation of its nuclear generating facilities. The following table includes the current year of expiration of nuclear operating licenses for nuclear stations in operation. On June 7, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal application for the Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS) with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission to renew ONS's operating license for an additional 20 years. Duke Energy has announced its intention to seek 20-year operating license renewals for each of the reactors it operates in Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,” for additional information.\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. For additional information on nuclear decommissioning activity, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\nRegulation\nState\nThe state electric utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail electric service within their respective states. The state electric utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s generating facilities. CPCNs issued by the state electric utility commissions, as applicable, authorize Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and operate its electric facilities and to sell electricity to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state electric utility commission is required for the entities within Electric Utilities and Infrastructure to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus earn a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to rates approved in base rate cases, each of the state electric utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\n14\nFuel, fuel-related costs and certain purchased power costs are eligible for recovery by Electric Utilities and Infrastructure. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure uses coal, hydroelectric, natural gas, oil, renewable generation and nuclear fuel to generate electricity, thereby maintaining a diverse fuel mix that helps mitigate the impact of cost increases in any one fuel. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in fuel costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for fuel costs and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.\nThe table below reflects significant electric rate case applications approved and effective in the past three years or applications currently pending approval.\n(a)    Step 1 rates are approximately 75% of the total and became effective July 30, 2020. Step 2 rates are approximately 25% of the total rate case increase. They were approved on July 28, 2021, and implemented in August 2021.\nAdditionally, in January 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a settlement agreement with the FPSC that will allow annual increases to its base rates, an agreed upon return on equity (“ROE”) and includes a base rate stay-out provision through 2024, among other provisions. The FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024. For more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”\nFederal\nThe FERC approves Electric Utilities and Infrastructure’s cost-based rates for electric sales to certain power and transmission wholesale customers. Regulations of FERC and the state electric utility commissions govern access to regulated electric and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Electric Utilities and Infrastructure.\nRTOs\nPJM and MISO are the ISOs and FERC-approved RTOs for the regions in which Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana operate. PJM and MISO operate energy, capacity and other markets, and control the day-to-day operations of bulk power systems through central dispatch.\nDuke Energy Ohio is a member of PJM and Duke Energy Indiana is a member of MISO. Transmission owners in these RTOs have turned over control of their transmission facilities and their transmission systems are currently under the dispatch control of the RTOs. Transmission service is provided on a regionwide, open-access basis using the transmission facilities of the RTO members at rates based on the costs of transmission service.\nEnvironmental\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this section. See the “Other Matters” section of Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy’s operations.\nGAS UTILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure conducts natural gas operations primarily through the regulated public utilities of Piedmont, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Kentucky. The natural gas operations are subject to the rules and regulations of the NCUC, PSCSC, PUCO, KPSC, TPUC, PHMSA and the FERC. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure serves residential, commercial, industrial and power generation natural gas customers, including customers served by municipalities who are wholesale customers. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure has over 1.6 million total customers, including 1.1 million customers located in North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee, and an additional 550,000 customers located within southwestern Ohio and northern Kentucky. In the Carolinas, Ohio and Kentucky, the service areas are comprised of numerous cities, towns and communities. In Tennessee, the service area is the metropolitan area of Nashville. The following map shows the service territory and investments in operating pipelines for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure as of December 31, 2021.\n15\nThe number of residential, commercial and industrial customers within the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure service territory is expected to increase over time. Average usage per residential customer is expected to remain flat or decline for the foreseeable future; however, decoupled rates in North Carolina and various rate design mechanisms in other jurisdictions partially mitigate the impact of the declining usage per customer on overall profitability.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure also owns, operates and has investments in various pipeline transmission and natural gas storage facilities.\nNatural Gas for Retail Distribution\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure is responsible for the distribution of natural gas to retail customers in its North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Ohio and Kentucky service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s natural gas procurement strategy is to contract primarily with major and independent producers and marketers for natural gas supply. It also purchases a diverse portfolio of transportation and storage service from interstate pipelines. This strategy allows Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to assure reliable natural gas supply and transportation for its firm customers during peak winter conditions. When firm pipeline services or contracted natural gas supplies are temporarily not needed due to market demand fluctuations, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure may release these services and supplies in the secondary market under FERC-approved capacity release provisions or make wholesale secondary market sales. In 2021, firm supply purchase commitment agreements provided 100% of the natural gas supply for both Piedmont and Duke Energy Ohio.\n16\nImpact of Weather\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure revenues are generally protected from the impact of weather fluctuations due to the regulatory mechanisms that are available in most service territories. In North Carolina, margin decoupling provides protection from both weather and other usage variations like conservation for residential and small and medium general service customers. Margin decoupling provides a set margin per customer independent of actual usage. In South Carolina, Tennessee and Kentucky, weather normalization adjusts revenues either up or down depending on how much warmer or colder than normal a given month has been. Weather normalization adjustments occur from November through March in South Carolina, from October through April in Tennessee and from November through April in Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio collects most of its non-fuel revenue through a fixed monthly charge that is not impacted by usage fluctuations that result from weather changes or conservation.\nCompetition\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure’s businesses operate as the sole provider of natural gas service within their retail service territories. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure owns and operates facilities necessary to transport and distribute natural gas. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure earns retail margin on the transmission and distribution of natural gas and not on the cost of the underlying commodity. Services are priced by state commission-approved rates designed to include the costs of providing these services and a reasonable return on invested capital. This regulatory policy is intended to provide safe and reliable natural gas service at fair prices.\nIn residential, commercial and industrial customer markets, natural gas distribution operations compete with other companies that supply energy, primarily electric companies, propane and fuel oil dealers, renewable energy providers and coal companies in relation to sources of energy for electric power plants, as well as nuclear energy. A significant competitive factor is price. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's primary product competition is with electricity for heating, water heating and cooking. Increases in the price of natural gas or decreases in the price of other energy sources could negatively impact competitive position by decreasing the price benefits of natural gas to the consumer. In the case of industrial customers, such as manufacturing plants, adverse economic or market conditions, including higher natural gas costs, could cause these customers to suspend business operations or to use alternative sources of energy in favor of energy sources with lower per-unit costs.\nHigher natural gas costs or decreases in the price of other energy sources may allow competition from alternative energy sources for applications that have traditionally used natural gas, encouraging some customers to move away from natural gas-fired equipment to equipment fueled by other energy sources. Competition between natural gas and other forms of energy is also based on efficiency, performance, reliability, safety and other non-price factors. Technological improvements in other energy sources and events that impair the public perception of the non-price attributes of natural gas could erode our competitive advantage. These factors in turn could decrease the demand for natural gas, impair our ability to attract new customers and cause existing customers to switch to other forms of energy or to bypass our systems in favor of alternative competitive sources. This could result in slow or no customer growth and could cause customers to reduce or cease using our product, thereby reducing our ability to make capital expenditures and otherwise grow our business, adversely affecting our earnings.\nPipeline and Storage Investments\nDuke Energy, through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment, has a 7.5% equity ownership interest in Sabal Trail. Sabal Trail is a joint venture that owns the Sabal Trail Natural Gas Pipeline (Sabal Trail pipeline) to transport natural gas to Florida, regulated by FERC. The Sabal Trail Phase I mainline was placed into service in July 2017 and traverses Alabama, Georgia and Florida. The remaining lateral line to the Duke Energy Florida's Citrus County CC was placed into service in March 2018. Phase II of Sabal Trail went into service in May 2020, adding approximately 200,000 Dth of capacity to the Sabal Trail pipeline.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 47% equity ownership interest in ACP, which planned to build the ACP pipeline, an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline. The ACP pipeline was intended to transport diverse natural gas supplies into southeastern markets and would be regulated by FERC. Dominion Energy owns 53% of ACP and was contracted to construct and operate the ACP pipeline upon completion. On July 5, 2020, Dominion announced a sale of substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, which were critical to the ACP pipeline. Further, permitting delays and legal challenges had materially affected the timing and cost of the pipeline. As a result, Duke Energy determined that they would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 24% equity ownership interest in Constitution, an interstate pipeline development company formed to develop, construct, own and operate a 124-mile natural gas pipeline and related facilities, regulated by FERC. Constitution was slated to transport natural gas supplies from the Marcellus supply region in northern Pennsylvania to major northeastern markets. As of February 5, 2020, the Constitution partners formally resolved to initiate the dissolution of Constitution, and to terminate the Constitution Pipeline project.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has a 21.49% equity ownership interest in Cardinal, an intrastate pipeline located in North Carolina regulated by the NCUC, a 45% equity ownership in Pine Needle, an interstate liquefied natural gas storage facility located in North Carolina and a 50% equity ownership interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in Hardy and Hampshire counties in West Virginia. Pine Needle and Hardy Storage are regulated by FERC.\nKO Transmission Company (KO Transmission), a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy Ohio, is an interstate pipeline company engaged in the business of transporting natural gas and is subject to the rules and regulations of FERC. KO Transmission's 90-mile pipeline supplies natural gas to Duke Energy Ohio and interconnects with the Columbia Gulf Transmission pipeline and Tennessee Gas Pipeline. An approximately 70-mile portion of KO Transmission's pipeline facilities is co-owned by Columbia Gas Transmission Corporation.\nSee Notes 3, 12 and 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\" and \"Variable Interest Entities,\" respectively, for further information on Duke Energy's pipeline investments.\nInventory\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure must maintain adequate natural gas inventory in order to provide reliable delivery to customers. As of December 31, 2021, the inventory balance for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure was $125 million. For more information on inventory, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\n17\nRegulation\nState\nThe state gas utility commissions approve rates for Duke Energy's retail natural gas service within their respective states. The state gas utility commissions, to varying degrees, have authority over the construction and operation of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure’s natural gas distribution facilities. CPCNs issued by the state gas utility commissions or other government agencies, as applicable, authorize Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to construct and operate its natural gas distribution facilities and to sell natural gas to retail and wholesale customers. Prior approval from the relevant state gas utility commission is required for Gas Utilities and Infrastructure to issue securities. The underlying concept of utility ratemaking is to set rates at a level that allows the utility to collect revenues equal to its cost of providing service plus a reasonable rate of return on its invested capital, including equity.\nIn addition to amounts collected from customers through approved base rates, each of the state gas utility commissions allow recovery of certain costs through various cost recovery clauses to the extent the respective commission determines in periodic hearings that such costs, including any past over- or under-recovered costs, are prudent.\nNatural gas costs are eligible for recovery by Gas Utilities and Infrastructure. Due to the associated regulatory treatment and the method allowed for recovery, changes in natural gas costs from year to year have no material impact on operating results of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure, unless a commission finds a portion of such costs to have been imprudent. However, delays between the expenditure for natural gas and recovery from customers can adversely impact the timing of cash flows of Gas Utilities and Infrastructure.\nThe following table summarizes certain components underlying recently approved and effective base rates or rate stabilization filings in the last three years.\n(a)    An ROE of 9.375% for natural gas base rates and 9.3% for natural gas riders was approved.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure has IMR mechanisms in North Carolina and Tennessee designed to separately track and recover certain costs associated with capital investments incurred to comply with federal pipeline safety and integrity programs. The following table summarizes information related to the recently approved IMR filing.\nIn Piedmont's Tennessee rate case settled in February 2021, the company included projected IMR investment through December 31, 2021, in its rate base. The recovery of integrity investment was requested in the rate case and not through the Tennessee IMR mechanism.\nFor more information on rate matters and other regulatory proceedings, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.”\nFederal\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to various federal regulations, including regulations that are particular to the natural gas industry. These federal regulations include but are not limited to the following:\n•\nRegulations of the FERC affect the certification and siting of new interstate natural gas pipeline projects, the purchase and sale of, the prices paid for, and the terms and conditions of service for the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas.\n•\nRegulations of the PHMSA affect the design, construction, operation, maintenance, integrity, safety and security of natural gas distribution and transmission systems.\n•\nRegulations of the EPA relate to the environment including proposed air emissions regulations that would expand to include emissions of methane.\nRegulations of the FERC and the state gas utility commissions govern access to regulated natural gas and other data by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated energy affiliates. These regulations affect the activities of nonregulated affiliates with Gas Utilities and Infrastructure.\n18\nEnvironmental\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure is subject to the jurisdiction of the EPA and state and local environmental agencies. For a discussion of environmental regulation, see “Environmental Matters” in this section. See “Other Matters” section of Item 7 Management's Discussion and Analysis for a discussion about potential Global Climate Change legislation and other EPA regulations under development and the potential impacts such legislation and regulation could have on Duke Energy’s operations.\nCOMMERCIAL RENEWABLES\nCommercial Renewables primarily acquires, develops, builds, operates and owns wind and solar renewable generation throughout the continental U.S. Commercial Renewables also enters into strategic transactions including minority ownership and tax equity structures in wind and solar generation. The portfolio includes nonregulated renewable energy and energy storage businesses.\nCommercial Renewables' renewable energy includes utility-scale wind and solar generation assets, distributed solar generation assets, distributed fuel cell assets and battery storage projects, which total 3,554 MW across 22 states from 23 wind facilities, 178 solar projects, 71 fuel cell locations and two battery storage facilities. Revenues are primarily generated by selling the power produced from renewable generation through long-term contracts to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and corporate customers. In most instances, these customers have obligations under state-mandated renewable energy portfolio standards or similar state or local renewable energy goals. Energy and renewable energy credits generated by wind and solar projects are generally sold at contractual prices. The following map shows the locations of renewable generation facilities of which Commercial Renewables has an ownership interest as of December 31, 2021.\nAs eligible projects are placed in service, Commercial Renewables generally recognizes either PTCs as power is generated by wind projects over 10 years or ITCs over the useful life of solar or fuel cell projects. Benefits of the tax basis adjustment due to the ITC are recognized as a reduction to income tax expense in the year in which the project is placed in service. Under the current law, the ITC for solar and fuel cells is being phased down from a rate of 30% for projects that began construction before 2020 to a permanent 10% rate for solar, and no ITC is available for fuel cells if construction begins after 2023. The PTC for onshore wind is currently phased out for projects beginning construction after 2021, but remains available for projects that began construction in 2021 or earlier.\nCommercial Renewables has entered into agreements for certain of its generating assets that are held by LLCs whose members include a noncontrolling tax equity investor. The allocation of tax attributes and cash flows to the tax equity investor are governed by the provisions of the LLC agreements. The GAAP earnings allocations to the tax equity investors can result in variability in earnings to Duke Energy as a result of the application of the HLBV method in allocating income or loss to the owners. As part of its growth strategy, Commercial Renewables expects to enter into these arrangements for future generating assets.\nFor additional information on Commercial Renewables' generation facilities, see Item 2, “Properties.”\n19\nMarket Environment and Competition\nCommercial Renewables primarily competes for wholesale contracts for the generation and sale of electricity from generation assets it either develops or acquires and owns. The market price of commodities and services, along with the quality and reliability of services provided, drive competition in the wholesale energy business. The number and type of competitors may vary based on location, generation type and project size. Commercial Renewables' main competitors include other nonregulated generators and wholesale power providers.\nSources of Electricity\nCommercial Renewables relies on wind, solar, fuel cells and battery resources for its generation of electric energy.\nRegulation\nCommercial Renewables is subject to regulation at the federal level, primarily from the FERC. Regulations of the FERC govern access to regulated market information by nonregulated entities and services provided between regulated and nonregulated utilities.\nOTHER\nThe remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. While it is not a business segment, Other primarily includes interest expense on holding company debt, unallocated corporate costs including costs to achieve strategic acquisitions, amounts related to certain companywide initiatives and contributions made to the Duke Energy Foundation. Other also includes Bison and an investment in NMC.\nThe Duke Energy Foundation is a nonprofit organization funded by Duke Energy shareholders that makes charitable contributions to selected nonprofits and government subdivisions.\nBison, a wholly owned subsidiary of Duke Energy, is a captive insurance company with the principal activity of providing Duke Energy subsidiaries with indemnification for financial losses primarily related to property, workers’ compensation and general liability.\nDuke Energy owns a 17.5% equity interest in NMC. The joint venture company has production facilities in Jubail, Saudi Arabia, where it manufactures certain petrochemicals and plastics. The company annually produces approximately 1 million metric tons each of MTBE and methanol and has the capacity to produce 50,000 metric tons of polyacetal. The main feedstocks to produce these products are natural gas and butane. Duke Energy records the investment activity of NMC using the equity method of accounting and retains 25% of NMC's board of directors' representation and voting rights.\nHuman Capital Management\nGovernance\nOur employees are critical to the success of our company. Our Human Resources organization is responsible for our human capital management strategy, which includes recruiting and hiring, onboarding and training, diversity and inclusion, workforce planning, talent and succession planning, performance management and employee development. Key areas of focus include fostering a high-performance and inclusive culture built on strong leadership and highly engaged and diverse employees, building a pipeline of skilled workers and ensuring knowledge transfer as employees retire.\nOur Board of Directors provides oversight on certain human capital management matters, primarily through the Compensation and People Development Committee, which is responsible for reviewing strategies and policies related to human capital management, including with respect to matters such as diversity and inclusion, employee engagement and talent development. The Compensation and People Development Committee also receives updates on employee engagement surveys and action plans.\nEmployees\nOn December 31, 2021, Duke Energy had a total of 27,605 full-time, part-time and temporary employees, the overwhelming majority of which were full-time employees. The total includes 5,064 employees who are represented by labor unions under various collective bargaining agreements that generally cover wages, benefits, working practices, and other terms and conditions of employment.\nCompensation\nThe company seeks to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce and leverages Duke Energy’s leadership imperatives to foster a culture focused on customers, innovation, and highly engaged employees. Our compensation program is market driven and designed to link pay to performance with the goal of attracting and retaining talented employees, rewarding individual performance, and encouraging long-term commitment to our business.

In addition to competitive base pay, we provide eligible employees with compensation and benefits under a variety of plans and programs, including with respect to health care benefits, retirement savings, pension, health savings and flexible spending accounts, wellness, family leaves, employee assistance, as well as other benefits including a charitable matching program. The company is committed to providing market competitive, fair, and equitable compensation and regularly conducts internal pay equity reviews, and benchmarking against peer companies to ensure our pay is competitive.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nDuke Energy is committed to continuing to build a diverse workforce that reflects the communities we serve while strengthening a culture of inclusion where employees and customers feel respected and valued. Our Enterprise Diversity and Inclusion Council, chaired by our Chief Operating Officer, monitors the effectiveness and execution of our diversity and inclusion strategy and programs. Employee-led councils are also embedded across the company in our business units and focus on the specific diversity and inclusion needs of the business and help drive inclusion deeper into the employee experience. Leaders and individual contributors also have the opportunity to participate in diversity and inclusion training programs and facilitated conversations on thought provoking topics offered to further our commitment to building and enabling an inclusive work environment.\n20\nOur aspirational goals include achieving workforce representation of at least 25% female and 20% racial and ethnic diversity. We continue to make strides toward reaching these aspirational goals and as of December 31, 2021, our workforce consisted of approximately 23.9% female and 19.6% racial and ethnic diversity.\nThe company also has a number of Employee Resource Groups (ERGs), which are networks of employees formed around a common dimension of diversity whose goals and objectives align with the company's goals and objectives. These groups focus on employee professional development and networking, community outreach, cultural awareness, recruiting and retention. They also serve as a resource to the company for advocacy and community outreach and improving customer service through innovation. ERG-sponsored forums include networking events, mentoring, scholarship banquets for aspiring college students, and workshops on topics such as time management, stress reduction, career planning and work-life balance. Our ERGs are open to all employees.\nAmong other efforts, the company has developed partnerships with community organizations, community colleges and historically Black colleges and universities to support our strategy of building a diverse and highly skilled talent pipeline.\nOperational Excellence\nThe foundation for our growth and success is our continued focus on operational excellence, the leading indicator of which is safety. As such, the safety of our workforce remains our top priority. The company closely monitors the total incident case rate (TICR), which is a metric based on strict OSHA definitions that measures the number of occupational injuries and illnesses per 100 employees. This objective emphasizes our focus on achieving an event-free and injury-free workplace. As an indication of our commitment to safety, we include safety metrics in both the short-term and long-term incentive plans based on the TICR for employees. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2021, consistent with our industry-leading performance levels from 2016 through 2020.\n21\nInformation about Our Executive Officers\nThe following table sets forth the individuals who currently serve as executive officers.

    "text": "In addition to other disclosures within this Form 10-K, including \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations – Matters Impacting Future Results\" for each registrant in Item 7, and other documents filed with the SEC from time to time, the following factors should be considered in evaluating Duke Energy and its subsidiaries. Such factors could affect actual results of operations and cause results to differ substantially from those currently expected or sought. Unless otherwise indicated, risk factors discussed below generally relate to risks associated with all of the Duke Energy Registrants. Risks identified at the Subsidiary Registrant level are generally applicable to Duke Energy.\n24\nBUSINESS STRATEGY RISKS\nDuke Energy’s future results could be adversely affected if it is unable to implement its business strategy including achieving its carbon emissions reduction goals.\nDuke Energy’s results of operations depend, in significant part, on the extent to which it can implement its business strategy successfully. Duke Energy's clean energy strategy, which includes achieving net-zero carbon emissions from electricity generation by 2050, modernizing the regulatory construct, transforming the customer experience, and digital transformation, is subject to business, policy, regulatory, technology, economic and competitive uncertainties and contingencies, many of which are beyond its control and may make those goals difficult to achieve.\nFederal or state policies could be enacted that restrict the availability of fuels or generation technologies, such as natural gas or nuclear power, that enable Duke Energy to reduce its carbon emissions. Supportive policies may be needed to facilitate the siting and cost recovery of transmission and distribution upgrades needed to accommodate the build out of large volumes of renewables and energy storage. Further, the approval of our state regulators will be necessary for the company to continue to retire existing carbon emitting assets or make investments in new generating capacity. The company may be constrained by the ability to procure resources or labor needed to build new generation at a reasonable price as well as to construct projects on time. In addition, new technologies that are not yet commercially available or are unproven at utility scale will be needed. If these technologies are not developed or are not available at reasonable prices, or if we invest in early-stage technologies that are then supplanted by technological breakthroughs, Duke Energy’s ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050 at a cost-effective price could be at risk.\nAchieving our carbon reduction goals will require continued operation of our existing carbon-free technologies including nuclear and renewables. The rapid transition to and expansion of certain low-carbon resources, such as renewables without cost-effective storage, may challenge our ability to meet customer expectations of reliability in a carbon constrained environment, Our nuclear fleet is central to our ability to meet these objectives and customer expectations. We are continuing to seek to renew the operating licenses of the 11 reactors we operate at six nuclear stations for an additional 20 years, extending their operating lives to and beyond midcentury. Failure to receive approval from the NRC for the relicensing of any of these reactors could affect our ability to achieve a net-zero target by 2050.\nAs a consequence, Duke Energy may not be able to fully implement or realize the anticipated results of its strategy, which may have an adverse effect on its financial condition.\nREGULATORY, LEGISLATIVE AND LEGAL RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility revenues, earnings and results are dependent on state legislation and regulation that affect electric generation, electric and natural gas transmission, distribution and related activities, which may limit their ability to recover costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated electric and natural gas utility businesses are regulated on a cost-of-service/rate-of-return basis subject to statutes and regulatory commission rules and procedures of North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Ohio, Tennessee, Indiana and Kentucky. If the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility earnings exceed the returns established by the state utility commissions, retail electric and natural gas rates may be subject to review and possible reduction by the commissions, which may decrease the Duke Energy Registrants’ earnings. Additionally, if regulatory bodies do not allow recovery of costs incurred in providing service, or do not do so on a timely basis, the Duke Energy Registrants’ earnings could be negatively impacted. Differences in regulation between jurisdictions with concurrent operations, such as North Carolina and South Carolina in Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' service territory, may also result in failure to recover costs.\nIf legislative and regulatory structures were to evolve in such a way that the Duke Energy Registrants’ exclusive rights to serve their regulated customers were eroded, their earnings could be negatively impacted. Federal and state regulations, laws, commercialization and reduction of costs and other efforts designed to promote and expand the use of EE measures and distributed generation technologies, such as private solar and battery storage, in Duke Energy service territories could reduce recovery of fixed costs in Duke Energy service territories or result in customers leaving the electric distribution system and an increase in customer net energy metering, which allows customers with private solar to receive bill credits for surplus power at the full retail amount. Over time, customer adoption of these technologies could result in Duke Energy not being able to fully recover the costs and investment in generation.\nState regulators have approved various mechanisms to stabilize natural gas utility margins, including margin decoupling in North Carolina and rate stabilization in South Carolina. State regulators have approved other margin stabilizing mechanisms that, for example, allow for recovery of margin losses associated with negotiated transactions designed to retain large volume customers that could use alternative fuels or that may otherwise directly access natural gas supply through their own connection to an interstate pipeline. If regulators decided to discontinue the Duke Energy Registrants' use of tariff mechanisms, it would negatively impact results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, regulatory authorities also review whether natural gas costs are prudently incurred and can disallow the recovery of a portion of natural gas costs that the Duke Energy Registrants seek to recover from customers, which would adversely impact earnings.\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility businesses are allowed to charge are established by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings, which may limit their ability to recover costs and earn an appropriate return on investment.\nThe rates that the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated utility business are allowed to charge significantly influences the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The regulation of the rates that the regulated utility businesses charge customers is determined, in large part, by state utility commissions in rate case proceedings. Negative decisions made by these regulators, or by any court on appeal of a rate case proceeding, could have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows and affect the ability of the Duke Energy Registrants to recover costs and an appropriate return on the significant infrastructure investments being made.\n25\nDeregulation or restructuring in the electric industry may result in increased competition and unrecovered costs that could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows and their utility businesses.\nIncreased competition resulting from deregulation or restructuring legislation could have a significant adverse impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position or cash flows. If the retail jurisdictions served by the Duke Energy Registrants become subject to deregulation, the impairment of assets, loss of retail customers, lower profit margins or increased costs of capital, and recovery of stranded costs could have a significant adverse financial impact on the Duke Energy Registrants. Stranded costs primarily include the generation assets of the Duke Energy Registrants whose value in a competitive marketplace may be less than their current book value, as well as above-market purchased power commitments from QFs from whom the Duke Energy Registrants are legally obligated to purchase energy at an avoided cost rate under PURPA. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the extent and timing of entry by additional competitors into the electric markets. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict if or when they will be subject to changes in legislation or regulation, nor can they predict the impact of these changes on their results of operations, financial position or cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses are subject to extensive federal regulation and a wide variety of laws and governmental policies, including taxes and environmental regulations, that may change over time in ways that affect operations and costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to regulations under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state regulations and policies, including by FERC, NRC, EPA and various other federal agencies as well as the North American Electric Reliability Corporation. Regulation affects almost every aspect of the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses, including, among other things, their ability to: take fundamental business management actions; determine the terms and rates of transmission and distribution services; make acquisitions; issue equity or debt securities; engage in transactions with other subsidiaries and affiliates; and pay dividends upstream to the Duke Energy Registrants. Changes to federal regulations are continuous and ongoing. There can be no assurance that laws, regulations and policies will not be changed in ways that result in material modifications of business models and objectives or affect returns on investment by restricting activities and products, subjecting them to escalating costs, causing delays, or prohibiting them outright.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations requiring significant capital expenditures that can increase the cost of operations, and which may impact or limit business plans, or cause exposure to environmental liabilities.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations affecting many aspects of their present and future operations, including CCRs, air emissions, water quality, wastewater discharges, solid waste and hazardous waste. These laws and regulations can result in increased capital, operating and other costs. These laws and regulations generally require the Duke Energy Registrants to obtain and comply with a wide variety of environmental licenses, permits, inspections and other approvals. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations can require significant expenditures, including expenditures for cleanup costs and damages arising from contaminated properties. Failure to comply with environmental regulations may result in the imposition of fines, penalties and injunctive measures affecting operating assets. The steps the Duke Energy Registrants could be required to take to ensure their facilities are in compliance could be prohibitively expensive. As a result, the Duke Energy Registrants may be required to shut down or alter the operation of their facilities, which may cause the Duke Energy Registrants to incur losses. Further, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be successful in recovering capital and operating costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations through existing regulatory rate structures and their contracts with customers. Also, the Duke Energy Registrants may not be able to obtain or maintain from time to time all required environmental regulatory approvals for their operating assets or development projects. Delays in obtaining any required environmental regulatory approvals, failure to obtain and comply with them or changes in environmental laws or regulations to more stringent compliance levels could result in additional costs of operation for existing facilities or development of new facilities being prevented, delayed or subject to additional costs. Although it is not expected that the costs to comply with current environmental regulations will have a material adverse effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows due to regulatory cost recovery, the Duke Energy Registrants are at risk that the costs of complying with environmental regulations in the future will have such an effect.\nThe EPA has enacted or proposed federal regulations governing the management of cooling water intake structures, wastewater and CO\n2\nemissions. New state legislation could impose carbon reduction goals that are more aggressive than the company's plans. These regulations may require the Duke Energy Registrants to make additional capital expenditures and increase operating and maintenance costs.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants' operations, capital expenditures and financial results may be affected by regulatory changes related to the impacts of global climate change.\nThere is continued concern, and increasing activism, both nationally and internationally, about climate change. The EPA and state regulators may adopt and implement regulations to restrict emissions of GHGs to address global climate change. Certain local and state jurisdictions have also enacted laws to restrict or prevent new gas infrastructure. Increased regulation of GHG emissions could impose significant additional costs on the Duke Energy Registrants' electric and natural gas operations, their suppliers and customers and affect demand for energy conservation and renewable products, which could impact both our electric and natural gas businesses. Regulatory changes could also result in generation facilities to be retired earlier than planned to meet our net-zero 2050 goal. Though we would plan to seek cost recovery for investments related to GHG emissions reductions through regulatory rate structures, changes in the regulatory climate could result in the failure to fully recover such costs and investment in generation.\nOPERATIONAL RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ operations have been and may be affected by COVID-19 in ways listed below and in ways the registrants cannot predict at this time.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has immaterially impacted and could impact the Duke Energy Registrants' business strategy, results of operations, financial position and cash flows in the future as a result of delays in rate cases or other legal proceedings, an inability to obtain labor or equipment necessary for the construction of large capital projects, an inability to procure satisfactory levels of fuels or other necessary equipment for the continued production of electricity and delivery of natural gas, and the health and availability of our critical personnel and their ability to perform business functions.\n26\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations may be negatively affected by overall market, economic and other conditions that are beyond their control.\nSustained downturns or sluggishness in the economy generally affect the markets in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate and negatively influence operations. Declines in demand for electricity or natural gas as a result of economic downturns in the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated service territories will reduce overall sales and lessen cash flows, especially as industrial customers reduce production and, therefore, consumption of electricity and the use of natural gas. Although the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated electric and natural gas businesses are subject to regulated allowable rates of return and recovery of certain costs, such as fuel and purchased natural gas costs, under periodic adjustment clauses, overall declines in electricity or natural gas sold as a result of economic downturn or recession could reduce revenues and cash flows, thereby diminishing results of operations. The Duke Energy Registrants also monitor the impacts of inflation on the procurement of goods and services and seek to minimize its effects in future periods through pricing strategies, productivity improvements, and cost reductions. Rapidly rising prices as a result of inflation or other factors may impact the ability of the company to recover costs timely or execute on its business strategy including the achievement of growth objectives. Additionally, prolonged economic downturns that negatively impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations and cash flows could result in future material impairment charges to write-down the carrying value of certain assets, including goodwill, to their respective fair values.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also sell electricity into the spot market or other competitive power markets on a contractual basis. With respect to such transactions, the Duke Energy Registrants are not guaranteed any rate of return on their capital investments through mandated rates, and revenues and results of operations are likely to depend, in large part, upon prevailing market prices. These market prices may fluctuate substantially over relatively short periods of time and could reduce the Duke Energy Registrants’ revenues and margins, thereby diminishing results of operations.\nFactors that could impact sales volumes, generation of electricity and market prices at which the Duke Energy Registrants are able to sell electricity and natural gas are as follows:\n•\nweather conditions, including abnormally mild winter or summer weather that cause lower energy or natural gas usage for heating or cooling purposes, as applicable, and periods of low rainfall that decrease the ability to operate facilities in an economical manner;\n•\nsupply of and demand for energy commodities;\n•\ntransmission or transportation constraints or inefficiencies that impact nonregulated energy operations;\n•\navailability of competitively priced alternative energy sources, which are preferred by some customers over electricity produced from coal, nuclear or natural gas plants, and customer usage of energy-efficient equipment that reduces energy demand;\n•\nnatural gas, crude oil and refined products production levels and prices;\n•\nability to procure satisfactory levels of inventory, including materials, supplies, and fuel such as coal, natural gas and uranium; and\n•\ncapacity and transmission service into, or out of, the Duke Energy Registrants’ markets.\nNatural disasters or operational accidents may adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ operating results.\nNatural disasters or operational accidents within the company or industry (such as forest fires, earthquakes, hurricanes or natural gas transmission pipeline explosions) could have direct or indirect impacts to the Duke Energy Registrants or to key contractors and suppliers. Further, the generation of electricity and the transportation and storage of natural gas involve inherent operating risks that may result in accidents involving serious injury or loss of life, environmental damage or property damage. Such events could impact the Duke Energy Registrants through changes to policies, laws and regulations whose compliance costs have a significant impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows. In addition, if a serious operational accident were to occur, existing insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred, including potential litigation awards. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance as a result of such accident, could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe reputation and financial condition of the Duke Energy Registrants could be negatively impacted due to their obligations to comply with federal and state regulations, laws, and other legal requirements that govern the operations, assessments, storage, closure, remediation, disposal and monitoring relating to CCR, the high costs and new rate impacts associated with implementing these new CCR-related requirements and the strategies and methods necessary to implement these requirements in compliance with these legal obligations.\nAs a result of electricity produced for decades at coal-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants manage large amounts of CCR that are primarily stored in dry storage within landfills or combined with water in surface impoundments, all in compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. A CCR-related operational incident could have a material adverse impact on the reputation and results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\n27\nDuring 2015, EPA regulations were enacted related to the management of CCR from power plants. These regulations classify CCR as nonhazardous waste under the RCRA and apply to electric generating sites with new and existing landfills and, new and existing surface impoundments, and establish requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures for the disposal and management of CCR. In addition to the federal regulations, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by existing state laws, regulations and permits, as well as additional legal requirements that may be imposed in the future, such as the settlement reached with the NCDEQ to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins in North Carolina, and partially excavate the remaining two, and EPA's January 11, 2022, issuance of a letter interpreting the CCR Rule, including its applicability and closure provisions. These federal and state laws, regulations and other legal requirements may require or result in additional expenditures, including increased operating and maintenance costs, which could affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants. The Duke Energy Registrants will continue to seek full cost recovery for expenditures through the normal ratemaking process with state and federal utility commissions, who permit recovery in rates of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated operations, and through other wholesale contracts with terms that contemplate recovery of such costs, although there is no guarantee of full cost\nrecovery. In addition, the timing for and amount of recovery of such costs could have a material adverse impact on Duke Energy's cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have recognized significant AROs related to these CCR-related requirements. Closure activities began in 2015 at the four sites specified as high priority by the Coal Ash Act and at the W.S. Lee Steam Station site in South Carolina in connection with other legal requirements. Excavation at these sites involves movement of CCR materials to off-site locations for use as structural fill, to appropriate engineered off-site or on-site lined landfills or conversion of the ash for beneficial use. Duke Energy has completed excavation of coal ash at three of the four high priority sites. At other sites, planning and closure methods have been studied and factored into the estimated retirement and management costs, and closure activities have commenced. As the closure and CCR management work progresses and final closure plans and corrective action measures are\ndeveloped and approved at each site, the scope and complexity of work and the amount of CCR material could be greater than estimates and could, therefore, materially increase compliance expenditures and rate impacts.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows may be negatively affected by a lack of growth or slower growth in the number of customers, or decline in customer demand or number of customers.\nGrowth in customer accounts and growth of customer usage each directly influence demand for electricity and natural gas and the need for additional power generation and delivery facilities. Customer growth and customer usage are affected by several factors outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants, such as mandated EE measures, demand-side management goals, distributed generation resources and economic and demographic conditions, such as population changes, job and income growth, housing starts, new business formation and the overall level of economic activity.\nCertain regulatory and legislative bodies have introduced or are considering requirements and/or incentives to reduce energy consumption by certain dates in response to concerns related to climate change. Additionally, technological advances driven by federal laws mandating new levels of EE in end-use electric and natural gas devices or other improvements in or applications of technology could lead to declines in per capita energy consumption.\nAdvances in distributed generation technologies that produce power, including fuel cells, microturbines, wind turbines and solar cells, may reduce the cost of alternative methods of producing power to a level competitive with central power station electric production utilized by the Duke Energy Registrants. In addition, the electrification of buildings and appliances currently relying on natural gas could reduce the number of customers in our natural gas distribution business.\nSome or all of these factors could result in a lack of growth or decline in customer demand for electricity or number of customers and may cause the failure of the Duke Energy Registrants to fully realize anticipated benefits from significant capital investments and expenditures, which could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nFurthermore, the Duke Energy Registrants currently have EE riders in place to recover the cost of EE programs in North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, Indiana, Ohio and Kentucky. Should the Duke Energy Registrants be required to invest in conservation measures that result in reduced sales from effective conservation, regulatory lag in adjusting rates for the impact of these measures could have a negative financial impact.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants future results may be impacted by changing expectations and demands including heightened emphasis on environmental, social and governance concerns.\nDuke Energy’s ability to execute its strategy and achieve anticipated financial outcomes are influenced by the expectations of our customers, regulators, investors, and stakeholders. Those expectations are based in part on the core fundamentals of reliability and affordability but are also increasingly focused on our ability to meet rapidly changing demands for new and varied products, services and offerings. Additionally, the risks of global climate change continues to shape our customers’ sustainability goals and energy needs as well as the investment and financing criteria of investors. Failure to meet these increasing expectations or to adequately address the risks and external pressures from regulators, customers, investors and other stakeholders may impact Duke Energy’s reputation and affect its ability to achieve favorable outcomes in future rate cases and the results of operations for the Duke Energy Registrants. Furthermore, the increasing use of social media may accelerate and increase the potential scope of negative publicity we might receive and could increase the negative impact on our reputation, business, results of operations, and financial condition.\nAs it relates to electric generation, a diversified fleet with increasingly clean generation resources may facilitate more efficient financing and lower costs. Conversely, jurisdictions utilizing more carbon-intensive generation such as coal may experience difficulty attracting certain investors and obtaining the most economical financing terms available. Furthermore, with this heightened emphasis on environmental, social, and governance concerns, and climate change in particular, there is an increased risk of litigation by activists.\n28\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis and can be negatively affected by changes in weather conditions and severe weather, including extreme weather conditions and changes in weather patterns from climate change.\nElectric power generation and natural gas distribution are generally seasonal businesses. In most parts of the U.S., the demand for power peaks during the warmer summer months, with market prices also typically peaking at that time. In other areas, demand for power peaks during the winter. Demand for natural gas peaks during the winter months. Further, changing frequency or magnitude of extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, droughts, heat waves, winter storms and severe weather, including from climate change, could cause these seasonal fluctuations to be more pronounced. As a result, the overall operating results of the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses may fluctuate substantially on a seasonal and quarterly basis and thus make period-to-period comparison less relevant.\nSustained severe drought conditions could impact generation by hydroelectric plants, as well as fossil and nuclear plant operations, as these facilities use water for cooling purposes and for the operation of environmental compliance equipment. Furthermore, destruction caused by severe weather events, such as hurricanes, flooding, tornadoes, severe thunderstorms, snow and ice storms, including from climate change, can result in lost operating revenues due to outages, property damage, including downed transmission and distribution lines, and additional and unexpected expenses to mitigate storm damage. The cost of storm restoration efforts may not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ sales may decrease if they are unable to gain adequate, reliable and affordable access to transmission assets.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants depend on transmission and distribution facilities owned and operated by utilities and other energy companies to deliver electricity sold to the wholesale market. In addition, the growth of renewables and energy storage will put strains on existing transmission assets and require transmission and distribution upgrades. The FERC’s power transmission regulations require wholesale electric transmission services to be offered on an open-access, non-discriminatory basis. If transmission is disrupted, or if transmission capacity is inadequate, the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to sell and deliver products may be hindered.\nThe different regional power markets have changing regulatory structures, which could affect growth and performance in these regions. In addition, the ISOs who oversee the transmission systems in regional power markets have imposed in the past, and may impose in the future, price limitations and other mechanisms to address volatility in the power markets. These types of price limitations and other mechanisms may adversely impact the profitability of the Duke Energy Registrants’ wholesale power marketing business.\nThe availability of adequate interstate pipeline transportation capacity and natural gas supply may decrease.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants purchase almost all of their natural gas supply from interstate sources that must be transported to the applicable service territories. Interstate pipeline companies transport the natural gas to the Duke Energy Registrants' systems under firm service agreements that are designed to meet the requirements of their core markets. A significant disruption to interstate pipelines capacity or reduction in natural gas supply due to events including, but not limited to, operational failures or disruptions, hurricanes, tornadoes, floods, freeze off of natural gas wells, terrorist or cyberattacks or other acts of war or legislative or regulatory actions or requirements, including remediation related to integrity inspections or regulations and laws enacted to address climate change, could reduce the normal interstate supply of natural gas and thereby reduce earnings. Moreover, if additional natural gas infrastructure, including, but not limited to, exploration and drilling rigs and platforms, processing and gathering systems, offshore pipelines, interstate pipelines and storage, cannot be built at a pace that meets demand, then growth opportunities could be limited.\nFluctuations in commodity prices or availability may adversely affect various aspects of the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations as well as their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the effects of market fluctuations in the price of natural gas, coal, fuel oil, nuclear fuel, electricity and other energy-related commodities as a result of their ownership of energy-related assets. Fuel costs are recovered primarily through cost recovery clauses, subject to the approval of state utility commissions.\nAdditionally, the Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to risk that counterparties will not be able to fulfill their obligations. Disruption in the delivery of fuel, including disruptions as a result of, among other things, bankruptcies, transportation delays, weather, labor relations, force majeure events or environmental regulations affecting any of these fuel suppliers, could limit the Duke Energy Registrants' ability to operate their facilities. Should counterparties fail to perform, the Duke Energy Registrants might be forced to replace the underlying commitment at prevailing market prices possibly resulting in losses in addition to the amounts, if any, already paid to the counterparties.\nCertain of the Duke Energy Registrants’ hedge agreements may result in the receipt of, or posting of, collateral with counterparties, depending on the daily market-based calculation of financial exposure of the derivative positions. Fluctuations in commodity prices that lead to the return of collateral received and/or the posting of collateral with counterparties could negatively impact liquidity. Downgrades in the Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings could lead to additional collateral posting requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants continually monitor derivative positions in relation to market price activity.\n29\nCyberattacks and data security breaches could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants' businesses.\nCybersecurity risks have increased in recent years as a result of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication, magnitude and frequency of cyberattacks and data security breaches. Duke Energy relies on the continued operation of sophisticated digital information technology systems and network infrastructure, which are part of an interconnected regional grid. Additionally, connectivity to the internet continues to increase through grid modernization and other operational excellence initiatives. Because of the critical nature of the infrastructure, increased connectivity to the internet and technology systems’ inherent vulnerability to disability or failures due to hacking, viruses, acts of war or terrorism or other types of data security breaches, the Duke Energy Registrants face a heightened risk of cyberattack from foreign or domestic sources and have been subject, and will likely continue to be subject, to attempts to gain unauthorized access to information and/or information systems or to disrupt utility operations through computer viruses and phishing attempts either directly or indirectly through its material vendors or related third parties. In the event of a significant cybersecurity breach on either the Duke Energy Registrants or with one of our material vendors or related third parties, the Duke Energy Registrants could (i) have business operations disrupted, including the disruption of the operation of our natural gas and electric assets and the power grid, theft of confidential company, employee, retiree, shareholder, vendor or customer information, and general business systems and process interruption or compromise, including preventing the Duke Energy Registrants from servicing customers, collecting revenues or the recording, processing and/or reporting financial information correctly, (ii) experience substantial loss of revenues, repair and restoration costs, penalties and costs for lack of compliance with relevant regulations, implementation costs for additional security measures to avert future cyberattacks and other financial loss and (iii) be subject to increased regulation, litigation and reputational damage. While Duke Energy maintains insurance relating to cybersecurity events, such insurance is subject to a number of exclusions and may be insufficient to offset any losses, costs or damage experienced. Also, the market for cybersecurity insurance is relatively new and coverage available for cybersecurity events is evolving as the industry matures.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to standards enacted by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation and enforced by FERC regarding protection of the physical and cyber security of critical infrastructure assets required for operating North America's bulk electric system. The Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to regulations set by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission regarding the protection of digital computer and communication systems and networks required for the operation of nuclear power plants. The Duke Energy Registrants that operate designated critical pipelines that transport natural gas are also subject to security directives issued by the Department of Homeland Security's Transportation Security Administration (TSA) requiring such registrants to implement specific cybersecurity mitigation measures. While the Duke Energy Registrants believe they are in compliance with, or, in the case of the recent TSA security directives, are in the process of implementing such standards and regulations, the Duke Energy Registrants have from time to time been, and may in the future be, found to be in violation of such standards and regulations. In addition, compliance with or changes in the applicable standards and regulations may subject the Duke Energy Registrants to higher operating costs and/or increased capital expenditures as well as substantial fines for non-compliance.\nDuke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s membership in an RTO presents risks that could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nThe rules governing the various regional power markets may change, which could affect Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s costs and/or revenues. To the degree Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana incur significant additional fees and increased costs to participate in an RTO, their results of operations may be impacted. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be allocated a portion of the cost of transmission facilities built by others due to changes in RTO transmission rate design. Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana may be required to expand their transmission system according to decisions made by an RTO rather than their own internal planning process. In addition, RTOs have been developing rules associated with the allocation and methodology of assigning costs associated with improved transmission reliability, reduced transmission congestion and firm transmission rights that may have a financial impact on the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana.\nAs members of an RTO, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are subject to certain additional risks, including those associated with the allocation among RTO members, of losses caused by unreimbursed defaults of other participants in the RTO markets and those associated with complaint cases filed against an RTO that may seek refunds of revenues previously earned by RTO members.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants may not recover costs incurred to begin construction on projects that are canceled.\nDuke Energy’s long-term strategy requires the construction of new projects, either wholly owned or partially owned, which involve a number of risks, including construction delays, nonperformance by equipment and other third-party suppliers, and increases in equipment and labor costs. To limit the risks of these construction projects, the Duke Energy Registrants enter into equipment purchase orders and construction contracts and incur engineering and design service costs in advance of receiving necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits. If any of these projects are canceled for any reason, including failure to receive necessary regulatory approvals and/or siting or environmental permits, significant cancellation penalties under the equipment purchase orders and construction contracts could occur. In addition, if any construction work or investments have been recorded as an asset, an impairment may need to be recorded in the event the project is canceled.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to risks associated with their ability to obtain adequate insurance at acceptable costs.\nThe financial condition of some insurance companies, actual or threatened physical or cyberattacks, and natural disasters, among other things, could have disruptive effects on insurance markets. The availability of insurance covering risks that the Duke Energy Registrants and their respective competitors typically insure against may decrease, and the insurance that the Duke Energy Registrants are able to obtain may have higher deductibles, higher premiums, and more restrictive policy terms. Further, the insurance policies may not cover all of the potential exposures or the actual amount of loss incurred. Any losses not covered by insurance, or any increases in the cost of applicable insurance, could adversely affect the results of operations, financial position or cash flows of the affected Duke Energy Registrant.\nOur business could be negatively affected as a result of actions of activist shareholders.\nWhile we strive to maintain constructive communications with our shareholders, activist shareholders may, from time to time, engage in proxy solicitations or advance shareholder proposals, or otherwise attempt to affect changes and assert influence on our Board and management. Perceived uncertainties as to the future direction or governance of the company may cause concern to our current or potential regulators, vendors or strategic partners, or make it more difficult to execute on our strategy or to attract and retain qualified personnel, which may have a material impact on our business and operating results.\n30\nIn addition, actions such as those described above could cause fluctuations in the trading price of our common stock, based on temporary or speculative market perceptions or other factors that do not necessarily reflect the underlying fundamentals and prospects of our business.\nNUCLEAR GENERATION RISKS\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida may incur substantial costs and liabilities due to their ownership and operation of nuclear generating facilities.\nOwnership interests in and operation of nuclear stations by Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida subject them to various risks. These risks include, among other things: the potential harmful effects on the environment and human health resulting from the current or past operation of nuclear facilities and the storage, handling and disposal of radioactive materials; limitations on the amounts and types of insurance commercially available to cover losses that might arise in connection with nuclear operations; and uncertainties with respect to the technological and financial aspects of decommissioning nuclear plants at the end of their licensed lives.\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities requires compliance with licensing and safety-related requirements imposed by the NRC. In the event of non-compliance, the NRC may increase regulatory oversight, impose fines or shut down a unit depending upon its assessment of the severity of the situation. Revised security and safety requirements promulgated by the NRC, which could be prompted by, among other things, events within or outside of the control of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, such as a serious nuclear incident at a facility owned by a third party, could necessitate substantial capital and other expenditures, as well as assessments to cover third-party losses. In addition, if a serious nuclear incident were to occur, it could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations, financial position, cash flows and reputation of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nLIQUIDITY, CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS AND COMMON STOCK RISKS\nThe Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term borrowings and longer-term debt and equity markets to finance their capital requirements and support their liquidity needs. Access to those markets can be adversely affected by a number of conditions, many of which are beyond the Duke Energy Registrants’ control.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses are significantly financed through issuances of debt and equity. The maturity and repayment profile of debt used to finance investments often does not correlate to cash flows from their assets. Accordingly, as a source of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flows from their operations and to fund investments originally financed through debt instruments with disparate maturities, the Duke Energy Registrants rely on access to short-term money markets as well as longer-term capital markets. The Subsidiary Registrants also rely on access to short-term intercompany borrowings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are not able to access debt or equity at competitive rates or at all, the ability to finance their operations and implement their strategy and business plan as scheduled could be adversely affected. An inability to access debt and equity may limit the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to pursue improvements or acquisitions that they may otherwise rely on for future growth.\nMarket disruptions may increase the cost of borrowing or adversely affect the ability to access one or more financial markets. Such disruptions could include: economic downturns, the bankruptcy of an unrelated energy company, unfavorable capital market conditions, market prices for electricity and natural gas, the generation mix of individual utilities, actual or threatened terrorist attacks, or the overall health of the energy industry. The availability of credit under Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility depends upon the ability of the banks providing commitments under the facility to provide funds when their obligations to do so arise. Systemic risk of the banking system and the financial markets could prevent a bank from meeting its obligations under the facility agreement.\nDuke Energy maintains a revolving credit facility to provide backup for its commercial paper program and letters of credit to support variable rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrant issuer at the option of the holder. The facility includes borrowing sublimits for the Duke Energy Registrants, each of whom is a party to the credit facility, and financial covenants that limit the amount of debt that can be outstanding as a percentage of the total capital for the specific entity. Failure to maintain these covenants at a particular entity could preclude Duke Energy from issuing commercial paper or the Duke Energy Registrants from issuing letters of credit or borrowing under the Master Credit Facility.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants must meet credit quality standards and there is no assurance they will maintain investment grade credit ratings. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain investment grade credit ratings, they would be required under credit agreements to provide collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash, which may materially adversely affect their liquidity.\nEach of the Duke Energy Registrants’ senior long-term debt issuances is currently rated investment grade by various rating agencies. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot ensure their senior long-term debt will be rated investment grade in the future.\nIf the rating agencies were to rate the Duke Energy Registrants below investment grade, borrowing costs would increase, perhaps significantly. In addition, the potential pool of investors and funding sources would likely decrease. Further, if the short-term debt rating were to fall, access to the commercial paper market could be significantly limited.\nA downgrade below investment grade could also require the posting of additional collateral in the form of letters of credit or cash under various credit, commodity and capacity agreements and trigger termination clauses in some interest rate derivative agreements, which would require cash payments. All of these events would likely reduce the Duke Energy Registrants’ liquidity and profitability and could have a material effect on their results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nNon-compliance with debt covenants or conditions could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ ability to execute future borrowings.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements.\n31\nMarket performance and other changes may decrease the value of the NDTF investments of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, which then could require significant additional funding.\nOwnership and operation of nuclear generation facilities also requires the maintenance of funded trusts that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of the respective nuclear power plants. The performance of the capital markets affects the values of the assets held in trust to satisfy these future obligations. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have significant obligations in this area and hold significant assets in these trusts. These assets are subject to market fluctuations and will yield uncertain returns, which may fall below projected rates of return. Although a number of factors impact funding requirements, a decline in the market value of the assets may increase the funding requirements of the obligations for decommissioning nuclear plants. If Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are unable to successfully manage their NDTF assets, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected.\nPoor investment performance of the Duke Energy pension plan holdings and other factors impacting pension plan costs could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ liquidity and results of operations.\nThe costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit pension plans are dependent upon a number of factors, such as the rates of return on plan assets, discount rates, the level of interest rates used to measure the required minimum funding levels of the plans, future government regulation and required or voluntary contributions made to the plans. The Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of the cost and obligations related to these plans. Without sustained growth in the pension investments over time to increase the value of plan assets and, depending upon the other factors impacting costs as listed above, Duke Energy could be required to fund its plans with significant amounts of cash. Such cash funding obligations, and the Subsidiary Registrants’ proportionate share of such cash funding obligations, could have a material impact on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, financial position and cash flows.\nDuke Energy is a holding company and depends on the cash flows from its subsidiaries to meet its financial obligations.\nBecause Duke Energy is a holding company with no operations or cash flows of its own, its ability to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on its common stock, is primarily dependent on the net income and cash flows of its subsidiaries and the ability of those subsidiaries to pay upstream dividends or to repay borrowed funds. Prior to funding Duke Energy, its subsidiaries have regulatory restrictions and financial obligations that must be satisfied. These subsidiaries are separate legal entities and have no obligation to provide Duke Energy with funds. In addition, Duke Energy may provide capital contributions or debt financing to its subsidiaries under certain circumstances, which would reduce the funds available to meet its financial obligations, including making interest and principal payments on outstanding indebtedness and to pay dividends on Duke Energy’s common stock.\nGENERAL RISKS\nThe failure of Duke Energy information technology systems, or the failure to enhance existing information technology systems and implement new technology, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses.\nDuke Energy’s operations are dependent upon the proper functioning of its internal systems, including the information technology systems that support our underlying business processes. Any significant failure or malfunction of such information technology systems may result in disruptions of our operations. In the ordinary course of business, we rely on information technology systems, including the internet and third-party hosted services, to support a variety of business processes and activities and to store sensitive data, including (i) intellectual property, (ii) proprietary business information, (iii) personally identifiable information of our customers, employees, retirees and shareholders and (iv) data with respect to invoicing and the collection of payments, accounting, procurement, and supply chain activities. Our information technology systems are dependent upon global communications and cloud service providers, as well as their respective vendors, many of whom have at some point experienced significant system failures and outages in the past and may experience such failures and outages in the future. These providers’ systems are susceptible to cybersecurity and data breaches, outages from fire, floods, power loss, telecommunications failures, break-ins and similar events. Failure to prevent or mitigate data loss from system failures or outages could materially affect the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nIn addition to maintaining our current information technology systems, Duke Energy believes the digital transformation of its business is key to driving internal efficiencies as well as providing additional capabilities to customers. Duke Energy’s information technology systems are critical to cost-effective, reliable daily operations and our ability to effectively serve our customers. We expect our customers to continue to demand more sophisticated technology-driven solutions and we must enhance or replace our information technology systems in response. This involves significant development and implementation costs to keep pace with changing technologies and customer demand. If we fail to successfully implement critical technology, or if it does not provide the anticipated benefits or meet customer demands, such failure could materially adversely affect our business strategy as well as impact the results of operations, financial position and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nPotential terrorist activities, or military or other actions, could adversely affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ businesses.\nThe continued threat of terrorism and the impact of retaliatory military and other action by the U.S. and its allies may lead to increased political, economic and financial market instability and volatility in prices for natural gas and oil, which may have material adverse effects in ways the Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict at this time. In addition, future acts of terrorism and possible reprisals as a consequence of action by the U.S. and its allies could be directed against companies operating in the U.S. Information technology systems, transportation systems for our fuel sources including natural gas pipelines, transmission and distribution and generation facilities such as nuclear plants could be potential targets of terrorist activities or harmful activities by individuals or groups that could have a material adverse effect on Duke Energy Registrants' businesses. In particular, the Duke Energy Registrants may experience increased capital and operating costs to implement increased security for their information technology systems, transmission and distribution and generation facilities, including nuclear power plants under the NRC’s design basis threat requirements. These increased costs could include additional physical plant security and security personnel or additional capability following a terrorist incident.\n32\nFailure to attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce could unfavorably impact the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations.\nCertain events, such as an aging workforce, mismatch of skill set or complement to future needs, or unavailability of contract resources may lead to operating challenges and increased costs. The challenges include lack of resources, loss of knowledge base and the lengthy time required for skill development. In this case, costs, including costs for contractors to replace employees, productivity costs and safety costs, may increase. Failure to hire and adequately train replacement employees, including the transfer of significant internal historical knowledge and expertise to new employees, or future availability and cost of contract labor may adversely affect the ability to manage and operate the business, especially considering the workforce needs associated with nuclear generation facilities and new skills required to operate a modernized, technology-enabled power grid. If the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to successfully attract and retain an appropriately qualified workforce, their results of operations, financial position and cash flows could be negatively affected."

Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of the Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nExecutive Overview\nAt Duke Energy the fundamentals of our business are strong and allow us to deliver growth in earnings and dividends in a low-risk, predictable and transparent way. In 2021, we continued to make progress, meeting our near-term financial commitments, executing on strategic priorities, and continuing to provide safe and reliable service while managing the ongoing impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nIn 2021, we continued to position the company for sustainable long-term growth, working with stakeholders to achieve comprehensive bipartisan energy legislation in North Carolina, executing an important North Carolina coal ash settlement agreement, and closing the first phase of the $2 billion investment of a minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana. We remain focused on executing on our clean energy transformation and a business portfolio that will deliver a reliable and growing dividend with 2021 representing the 95th consecutive year Duke Energy paid a cash dividend on its common stock.\nFinancial Results\n(a)\nSee Results of Operations below for Duke Energy’s definition of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS as well as a reconciliation of this non-GAAP financial measure to net income available to Duke Energy and net income available to Duke Energy per basic share.\n40\nDuke Energy's 2021 Net Income Available to Duke Energy Corporation (GAAP Reported Earnings) were impacted by favorable rate case outcomes and improved volumes offset by charges which management believes are not indicative of ongoing performance, including impairments related to workplace and workforce realignment and regulatory settlements. See “Results of Operations” below for a detailed discussion of the consolidated results of operations and a detailed discussion of financial results for each of Duke Energy’s reportable business segments, as well as Other.\n2021 Areas of Focus and Accomplishments\nClean Energy Transformation\n. Our industry has been undergoing an incredible transformation and 2021 was a watershed year for our company where we executed on strategic priorities and delivered on our vision.\nCoal Ash Settlement\nIn January 2021, we reached an agreement with the North Carolina Attorney General, the North Carolina Public Staff, and the Sierra Club on costs related to coal ash management and safe basin closure, resolving the last remaining major issues on coal ash management in North Carolina. This settlement is significant as it resolves pending issues in the multiyear coal ash basin closure debate in North Carolina, which is critical for paving the way toward our clean energy future. The agreement brought financial clarity to approximately $9 billion of mitigation costs, supporting coal ash cost recovery in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with a rate of return for the company. We agreed to reduce North Carolina customers’ costs by approximately $1 billion, while maintaining our ability to achieve our long-term financial goals and our transition to cleaner energy. The settlement agreement resolved all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with the 2019 rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases.\nMinority Interest Investment in Duke Energy Indiana\nIn a significant move to support the company’s path to net-zero strategy, in September 2021 we completed the first phase of the investment of a 19.9% minority interest in Duke Energy Indiana by an affiliate of GIC, transferring 11.05% ownership interest in exchange for approximately $1.025 billion. The proceeds from the two-phase $2.05 billion investment are expected to partially fund the company’s $63 billion capital and investment expenditure plan. This plan includes grid improvement, investments in clean energy and an improved customer experience – keys to our strategy to reduce carbon emissions from electricity generation to net-zero by 2050.\nNorth Carolina Energy Legislation\nIn October 2021, North Carolina House Bill 951 was signed into law after legislative leaders announced bipartisan support for and the General Assembly passed this new legislation. House Bill 951 reflects new state policy that would accelerate a clean energy transition for generation serving customers in the Carolinas, including providing a framework for a goal of 70% carbon reduction in electric generation in the state from 2005 levels by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050 while continuing to prioritize affordability and reliability for our customers, who are located in North Carolina and South Carolina. The legislation establishes a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO\n2\nemission reductions through the use of least cost planning, including stakeholder involvement, and also introduces modernized recovery mechanisms, including multiyear rate plans, that promote more efficient recovery of investments and align incentives between the company and the state’s energy policy objectives.\nGenerating Cleaner Energy\nWe’re targeting energy generated from coal to represent less than 5% by 2030 and a full exit by 2035, subject to regulatory approvals. We’ve made strong progress to date in reducing carbon emissions from electricity generation (a 44% reduction from 2005) and have committed to do more (at least 50% reduction by 2030 and net-zero by 2050). We’ve filed and refined comprehensive IRPs consistent with this strategy in multiple jurisdictions and updated the enterprise capital plan through 2026 to increase planned investments to $63 billion with over 80% of this capital plan funding investments in the grid and clean energy transition. The increased capital plan will allow us to accelerate coal plant retirements, make needed grid investments to enable renewables and energy storage, increase resiliency, and allow for dynamic power flows.\nOur commitment for 2030 includes retiring higher-emitting plants, operating our existing carbon-free resources and investing in renewables, our energy delivery system, and natural gas infrastructure. In 2021, we passed the milestone of 10,000 MW of solar and wind resources and plan to own or purchase 16,000 MW of renewables by 2025 and 24,000 MW by 2030. In June, we filed an application with the NRC to renew Oconee Nuclear Station's operating licenses for an additional 20 years and we intend to seek 20-year extensions and renewal of operating licenses for all 11 reactors. As we look beyond 2030, we will need additional tools to continue our progress. We will work actively to advocate for research and development and deployment of carbon-free, dispatchable resources. That includes longer-duration energy storage, advanced nuclear technologies, carbon capture and zero-carbon fuels.\nModernizing the Power Grid and Natural Gas Infrastructure\nOur grid improvement programs continue to be a key component of our growth strategy. Modernization of the electric grid, including smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing and targeted undergrounding, helps to ensure the system is better prepared for severe weather, improves the system's reliability and flexibility, and provides better information and services for customers. We continue to expand our self-optimizing grid capabilities, and in 2021, smart, self-healing technologies helped to avoid more than 700,000 extended customer outages across our six-state electric service area, saving customers more than 1.2 million hours of lost outage time. We added 60 new self-healing networks in 2021 across our six-state service area and upgraded many existing systems to improve their smart capabilities and self-healing efficiency. Additionally, we expect to invest $100 million in electric vehicle charging over the next three years. Duke Energy has a demonstrated track record of driving efficiencies and productivity into the business and we continue to leverage new technology, digital tools and data analytics across the business in response to a transforming landscape.\n41\nRecognizing the continued importance of natural gas to our plans, we continue to work toward a net-zero methane emission goal by 2030 related to our natural gas distribution business. In August 2021, we announced a partnership with Accenture and Microsoft to develop a novel technology platform with the intent of measuring baseline methane emissions from natural gas distribution systems with a high level of accuracy in near real time. Once deployed, we expect the use of satellite technology and the new platform will increase the speed of a field response team’s ability to identify and repair methane leaks along distribution lines and systems.\nConstructive Regulatory and Legislative Outcomes\n. One of our long-term strategic goals is to achieve modernized regulatory constructs in our jurisdictions. Modernized constructs provide benefits, which include improved earnings and cash flows through more timely recovery of investments, as well as stable pricing for customers. As highlighted above, House Bill 951 provides the framework for many of these benefits in North Carolina under the direction of the NCUC. Also, in October 2021, the Southeast Energy Exchange Market (SEEM) received clearance from the FERC. The new SEEM platform will facilitate sub-hourly, bilateral trading, allowing participants to buy and sell power close to the time the energy is consumed, utilizing available unreserved transmission. Southeastern electricity customers are expected to see cost, reliability and environmental benefits.\nIn 2021, we received constructive rate case orders related to our 2019 North Carolina rate cases for both Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and also reached constructive settlement agreements in our natural gas businesses in Kentucky, North Carolina, and Tennessee. In October 2021, Duke Energy Ohio filed a request to review the company’s electric distribution rates. We have a multiyear rate plan in Florida and in January 2021, we reached a constructive settlement agreement with key consumer groups to bring additional certainty to rates through 2024. In addition, grid investment riders in the Midwest and Florida enable more timely cost recovery and earnings growth.\nCustomer Satisfaction\n.\nDuke Energy continues to transform the customer experience through our use of customer data to better inform operational priorities and performance levels. This data-driven approach allows us to identify the investments that are the most important to the customer experience. We successfully implemented the first three jurisdictional releases of Customer Connect, a new system that consolidates four legacy billing systems into one customer-service platform, allowing us to deliver the universal experience customers expect. Our work has been recognized by our customers and we have maintained our above-target performance throughout the year, despite the resumption of standard billing and payment practices in most jurisdictions.\nOperational Excellence, Safety and Reliability\n.\nThe reliable and safe operation of our power plants, electric distribution system and natural gas infrastructure in our communities is foundational to our customers, our financial results and our credibility with stakeholders. Our regulated generation fleet and nuclear sites had strong performance throughout the year and our electric distribution system performed well. The safety of our workforce is a core value. Our employees delivered strong safety results in 2021, and we are at or near the top of our industry.\nStorm activity was limited in our regulated service territories in 2021, but we supported Entergy Louisiana, sending approximately 500 workers to aid in restoring power after Hurricane Ida. The February winter storm in Texas adversely impacted Duke Energy Renewables’ operations. In addition to operating at reduced capacity, we were required to purchase power at scarcity pricing levels to meet fixed volume commitments. Enterprisewide lessons learned were formed immediately following the Texas weather event to identify opportunities to ensure readiness for extreme weather. Our ability to effectively handle all facets of the 2021 storm response efforts, including navigating ongoing COVID-19 protocols, is a testament to our team’s extensive preparation and coordination, applying lessons learned from previous storms, and to on-the-ground management throughout the restoration efforts. Duke Energy has received over 20 Emergency Response Awards since EEI began recognizing storm response in 1998 (including eight for assisting other utilities, and eight in our service territories over the last decade).\nLeading Through COVID-19\n.\nCOVID-19 continued to impact all that we accomplished in 2021 and demonstrated our resiliency and agility:\n•\nIn addition to achieving financial results in the upper half of our original guidance, we have continued our cost-management journey – focused on driving productivity, increasing flexibility and prioritizing spend based on risk and strategic value to our customers and investors. In 2021, we maintained approximately $200 million of O&M savings identified during the earliest days of the pandemic. We also have successfully navigated supply chain challenges and the impacts of inflation. Our procurement teams have created action plans to enhance planning, augment supply, amend operations and leverage our scale to mitigate these risks to the extent possible.\n•\nDuke Energy kept electricity and natural gas flowing while continuing to voluntarily make significant accommodations for our customers. To continue to support our customers, we extended the COVID-19 payment flexibility policies we developed in 2020 without compromising our financial performance. We extended payment arrangements for new arrearages, modified reconnection policies and increased the time customers had to restructure agreements. We analyzed each state’s regulatory environment to identify additional state-specific solutions. To better connect customers to federal and state assistance dollars: a dedicated Agency team was created to help local customer assistance agencies in making pledges for Duke Energy customers; a small team was established to work directly with state and federal agencies; and a team of “payment navigators” was piloted to work directly with customers to connect them with available assistance dollars in their local communities.\n•\nWe implemented safety procedures designed to provide physical safety for our workers and provided support for our employees. Throughout the year, we aligned with local, state, and federal policies on COVID-19 protocols.\n•\nIn May, we announced that the Duke Energy Plaza, a 40-floor office tower currently under construction in Uptown Charlotte, will become the company’s new corporate headquarters, allowing us to reduce occupied space in the Charlotte area by approximately 60% to optimize our real estate footprint. We've rolled out our new hybrid workplace model (WorkSmart) with about 85% of our office-based workforce working in the WorkSmart model. The WorkSmart team has prepared our buildings to ensure employees return to work safely and have put in place the tools and technologies needed to ensure the most effective transition.\n42\nDuke Energy Objectives – 2022 and Beyond\nDuke Energy will continue to deliver exceptional value to customers, be an integral part of the communities in which we do business and provide attractive returns to investors. We have an achievable, long-term strategy in place, and it is producing tangible results, yet the industry in which we operate is becoming more and more dynamic. We are adjusting, where necessary, and accelerating our focus in key areas to ensure the company is well positioned to be successful for many decades into the future. As we look ahead to 2022, our plans include:\n•\nContinuing to place the customer at the center of all that we do, which includes providing customized products and solutions\n•\nStrengthening our relationships with our stakeholders in the communities in which we operate and invest\n•\nGenerating cleaner energy and working to achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and net-zero methane emissions by 2030\n•\nModernizing and strengthening a green-enabled energy grid and our natural gas infrastructure\n•\nMaintaining the safety of our communities and employees\n•\nDeploying digital tools across our business\n•\nWorking to encourage greenhouse gas emission reductions in our supply chain as we implement the update to our goals to include Scope 2 and certain Scope 3 emissions in our 2050 net-zero goal.  The Scope 3 emissions included in our goal include emissions from upstream fossil fuel procurement, production of power purchased for resale, and from downstream use of sold products in our natural gas distribution business.\nMatters Impacting Future Results\nThe matters discussed herein could materially impact the future operating results, financial condition and cash flows of the Duke Energy Registrants and Business Segments.\nRegulatory Matters\nCoal Ash Costs\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have approxi\nmately $1.2 billion and $1.4 billion, respectively, in regulatory assets related to coal ash retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021. Future spending, including amounts recorded for depreciation and liability accretion, is expected to continue to be deferred. The majority of spend is expected to occur over the next 15-20 years.\nDuke Energy Indiana has interpreted the CCR rule to identify the coal ash basin sites impacted and has assessed the amounts of coal ash subject to the rule and a method of compliance. In 2020, the Hoosier Environmental Council filed a petition challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management's (IDEM) partial approval of five of Duke Energy Indiana’s ash pond site closure plans at Gallagher Station. The petition does not challenge the other basin closures approved by IDEM at other Indiana stations. Interpretation of the requirements of the CCR rule is subject to further legal challenges and regulatory approvals, which could result in additional ash basin closure requirements, higher costs of compliance and greater AROs. Additionally, Duke Energy Indiana has retired facilities that are not subject to the CCR rule. Duke Energy Indiana may incur costs at these facilities to comply with environmental regulations or to mitigate risks associated with on-site storage of coal ash. Duke Energy Indiana has approximately $749 million in regulatory assets related to coal ash asset retirement obligations as of December 31, 2021. In January 2022, Duke Energy Indiana received a letter from the EPA regarding interpretation of the CCR rule. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for more information.\nMGP\nDuke Energy Ohio and other parties have filed with the PUCO a Stipulation and Recommendation that would resolve all open issues regarding manufactured gas plant remediation costs incurred between 2013 and 2019, including Duke Energy Ohio's request for additional deferral authority beyond 2019, and the pending issues related to the Tax Act as it relates to Duke Energy Ohio's natural gas operations. These impacts, if approved by the PUCO, are not expected to have a material impact on Duke Energy Ohio's financial statements. Duke Energy Ohio has approximately $104 million in\nregulatory assets related to MGP as of December 31, 2021. Failure to approve the Stipulation and Recommendation, disallowance of costs incurred, failure to complete the work by the deadline or failure to obtain an extension from the PUCO could result in an adverse impact.\nFor additional information, se\ne Note\n3\nt\no the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters.\"\nCommercial Renewables\nDuke Energy continues to monitor recoverability of renewable merchant plants located in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market and in the PJM West market, due to fluctuating market pricing and long-term forecasted energy prices. Based on the most recent recoverability test, the carrying value approximated the aggregate estimated future undiscounted cash flows for the assets under review. A continued decline in energy market pricing or other factors unfavorably impacting the economics would likely result in a future impairment. Duke Energy has approximately $200 million in property, plant and equipment related to these assets as of December 31, 2021. Impairment of these a\nssets could result in adverse impacts. For additional information, see Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\nIn February 2021, a severe winter storm impacted certain Commercial Renewables assets in Texas. Extreme weather conditions limited the ability for these solar and wind facilities to generate and sell electricity into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas market. Lost revenues and higher than expected purchased power costs have negatively impacted the operating results of these generating units. In addition, Duke Energy has been named in multiple lawsuits arising out of this winter storm. For more information, see Notes 2 and 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments\" and \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" respectively.\n43\nDuke Energy is also monitoring supply chain disruptions, including the cost and availability of key components of planned generating facilities, which could impact the timing of in-service or economics of commercial renewables projects and may result in adverse impacts on operating results.\nResults of Operations\nNon-GAAP Measures\nManagement evaluates financial performance in part based on non-GAAP financial measures, including adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS. These items represent income from continuing operations available to Duke Energy common stockholders in dollar and per share amounts, adjusted for the dollar and per share impact of special items. As discussed below, special items include certain charges and credits, which management believes are not indicative of Duke Energy's ongoing performance. Management believes the presentation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS provides useful information to investors, as it provides them with an additional relevant comparison of Duke Energy’s performance across periods.\nManagement uses these non-GAAP financial measures for planning and forecasting, and for reporting financial results to the Board of Directors, employees, stockholders, analysts and investors. Adjusted EPS is also used as a basis for employee incentive bonuses. The most directly comparable GAAP measures for adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS are GAAP Reported Earnings and EPS Available to Duke Energy Corporation common stockholders (GAAP Reported EPS), respectively.\nSpecial items included in the periods presented include the following, which management believes do not reflect ongoing costs:\n•\nWorkplace and Workforce Realignment represents costs attributable to business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes and workforce realignment.\n•\nRegulatory Settlements represents an impairment charge related to the South Carolina Supreme Court decision on coal ash, insurance proceeds, the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress coal ash settlement and the partial settlements in the 2019 North Carolina rate cases.\n•\nGas Pipeline Investments represents costs related to the cancellation of the ACP investment and additional exit obligations.\n•\nSeverance represents the reversal of 2018 Severance charges, which were deferred as a result of a partial settlement in the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress 2019 North Carolina rate cases.\nDuke Energy’s adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of another company because other companies may not calculate the measures in the same manner.\nReconciliation of GAAP Reported Amounts to Adjusted Amounts\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of adjusted earnings and adjusted EPS to the most directly comparable GAAP measures.\n(a)\nNet of tax benefit of $44 million.\n(b)    Net of tax benefit of $21 million and tax benefit of $263 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n(c)    Net of tax benefit of $5 million and tax benefit of $399 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n(d)    Net of tax expense of $23 million.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020\nGAAP Reported EPS was $4.94 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $1.72 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in GAAP Reported Earnings/EPS was primarily due to prior year charges related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline and the CCR Settlement Agreement filed with the NCUC, partially offset by workplace and workforce realignment costs in the current year.\nAs discussed and shown in the table above, management also evaluates financial performance based on adjusted EPS. Duke Energy’s adjusted EPS was $5.24 for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $5.12 for the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in Adjusted Earnings/Adjusted EPS was primarily due to positive rate case contributions and higher volumes, partially offset by higher operation and maintenance expenses, lower Commercial Renewables earnings and share dilution from equity issuances.\n44\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe remaining information presented in this discussion of results of operations is on a GAAP basis. Management evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables. The remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other. See Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Business Segments,” for additional information on Duke Energy’s segment structure.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\nYear Ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure’s variance is due to higher revenues from rate cases in various jurisdictions, higher retail sales volumes and the prior year coal ash settlement agreement filed with the NCUC, partially offset by an impairment charge related to the South Carolina Supreme Court decision on coal ash, higher depreciation and amortization and interest expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $420 million increase in retail base rate pricing due to general rate cases in Indiana and North Carolina net of rider impacts as well as annual increases from the multiyear settlement rate adjustments in Florida;\n•\na $192 million increase in weather-normal retail sales volumes;\n•\na $172 million increase in fuel revenues primarily driven by higher sales volumes; and\n•\na $145 million increase in wholesale revenues primarily due to a prior year coal ash settlement agreement filed with the NCUC.\nPartially offset by:\n•\na $140 million decrease in storm revenues due to full recovery of Hurricane Dorian costs in the prior year.\n45\nOperating Expenses.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $767 million decrease in impairment of assets and other charges primarily due to the prior year CCR Settlement Agreement filed with the NCUC in January 2021, partially offset by the South Carolina Supreme Court decision on coal ash at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in the current year; and\n•\na $51 million decrease in operations, maintenance and other driven by decreased storm amortization at Duke Energy Florida and lower COVID-19 costs, partially offset by higher employee-related expenses.\nPartially offset by:\n•\na $204 million increase in fuel used in electric generation and purchased power primarily due to higher sales volumes;\n•\na $183 million increase in depreciation and amortization primarily due to resolution of rate cases and higher plant in service, partially offset by lower depreciation related to the extension of the lives of nuclear facilities at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress; and\n•\na $45 million increase in property and other taxes primarily due to higher property taxes at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Ohio and a prior year sales and use tax refund at Duke Energy Carolinas.\nOther Income and Expenses, net.\nThe increase is primarily due to coal ash insurance litigation proceeds at Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and lower non-service pension costs.\nInterest Expense.\nThe variance was primarily driven by interest expense on excess deferred tax liabilities removed from rate base as a result of the North Carolina rate cases, debt returns on a lower coal ash regulatory asset balance resulting from the CCR Settlement Agreement as well lower debt returns resulting from the Indiana rate case.\nIncome Tax Expense.\nT\nhe increase in tax expense was primarily due to an increase in pretax income, partially offset by an increase in the amortization of excess deferred taxes.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nYear Ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure’s results were impacted primarily by the cancellation of the ACP pipeline in the prior year and margin growth, partially offset by higher depreciation expense. The following is a detailed discussion of the variance drivers by line item.\nOperating Revenues.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $245 million increase due to higher natural gas costs passed through to customers, higher volumes and increased off-system sales natural gas costs;\n•\na $52 million increase due to base rate increases;\n•\na $22 million increase due to rider revenues related to the Ohio Capital Expenditure Program (CEP);\n46\n•\na $12 million increase due to customer growth; and\n•\nan $11 million increase due to North Carolina IMR.\nOperating Expenses.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $245 million increase in cost of natural gas due to higher natural gas prices, higher volumes and increased off-system sales natural gas costs;\n•\na $45 million increase in depreciation due to additional plant in service and depreciation adjustments; and\n•\na $12 million increase in impairment of assets and other charges related to the propane caverns in Ohio and Kentucky, partially offset by an impairment of ACP redelivery projects in the prior year.\nEquity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates.\nThe variance was driven primarily by the cancellation of the ACP pipeline in the prior year.\nIncome Tax Expense.\nThe increase in tax expense was primarily due to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project recorded in the prior year.\nCommercial Renewables\n(a)    Certain projects are included in tax-equity structures where investors have differing interests in the project's economic attributes. Amounts shown represent 100% of the tax-equity project's capacity.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020\nCommercial Renewables' results were unfavorable to prior year primarily driven by the impacts from Texas Storm Uri, which resulted in a $35 million pretax loss, as well as lower earnings from unfavorable wind resource and fewer projects financed with tax equity being placed in service in the current year.\nOperating Revenues.\nThe variance was primarily driven by a $19 million decrease due to lower wind resource and operating downtime, a $15 million decrease for lower market prices in the current year impacting the wind portfolio, and a $4 million decrease due to fewer distributed energy projects placed into service. This was partially offset by an $8 million increase for market sales in excess of market purchases during Texas Storm Uri and a $6 million increase due to growth of new projects.\nOperating Expenses.\nThe variance was primarily due to $49 million for higher operating expenses, depreciation expense and property tax expense as a result of the growth in new projects placed in service since prior year, $31 million increase for higher operating expenses attributed to maintenance at several wind and solar facilities, an $8 million increase for higher engineering and construction costs within the distributed energy portfolio, and a $2 million increase associated with Texas Storm Uri. This was partially offset by a $6 million decrease related to an impairment charge in the prior year for a non-contracted wind project.\nOther Income and Expenses, net.\nThe variance was primarily driven by a $29 million loss in equity earnings due to the impacts of Texas Storm Uri.\nIncome Tax Benefit.\nThe increase in the tax benefit was primarily driven by an increase in pretax losses partially offset by an increase in taxes associated with tax equity investments and a decrease in PTCs generated.\nLoss Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests.\nThe variance was primarily driven by the net increase of losses allocated to tax equity members of $60 million from existing and new projects financed with tax equity, partially offset by a $12 million loss resulting from Texas Storm Uri.\n47\nOther\nYear Ended December 31, 2021, as compared to 2020\nThe higher net loss was driven by asset impairments to optimize the company's real estate portfolio and reduce office space as parts of the business move to a hybrid and remote workforce strategy as well as a reversal of severance costs in the prior year.\nOperating Expenses.\nThe increase in operations, maintenance and other of $248 million was primarily due to a reversal of severance costs in the prior year and higher obligations to the Duke Energy Foundation in the current year. The increase in impairment of assets and other charges of $132 million was due to asset impairments taken in order to optimize the company's real estate portfolio and reduce office space as parts of the business move to a hybrid and remote workforce strategy.\nOther Income and Expenses, net.\nThe variance was primarily due to higher equity earnings from the NMC investment.\nIncome Tax Benefit.\nThe increase in the tax benefit was primarily driven by an increase in pretax losses and a reduction of a valuation allowance relating to a capital loss carryforward, partially offset by lower state tax expense in the prior year.\n48\nSUBSIDIARY REGISTRANTS\nBasis of Presentation\nThe results of operations and variance discussion for the Subsidiary Registrants is presented in a reduced disclosure format in accordance with General Instruction (I)(2)(a) of Form 10-K.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nResults of Operations\nThe following table shows the percent changes in GWh sales and average number of customers for Duke Energy Carolinas.

Judgments made include the likelihood of success of particular projects, possible legal and regulatory challenges, earnings assumptions on pension and other benefit fund investments and anticipated recovery of costs, especially through regulated operations.\nManagement discusses these policies, estimates and assumptions with senior members of management on a regular basis and provides periodic updates on management decisions to the Audit Committee. Management believes the areas described below require significant judgment in the application of accounting policy or in making estimates and assumptions that are inherently uncertain and that may change in subsequent periods.\nFor further information, see Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.\"\nRegulated Operations Accounting\nSubstantially all of Duke Energy’s regulated operations meet the criteria for application of regulated operations accounting treatment. As a result, Duke Energy is required to record assets and liabilities that would not be recorded for nonregulated entities. Regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. Regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a regulator will require Duke Energy to make refunds to customers or reduce rates to customers for previous collections or deferred revenue for costs that have yet to be incurred.\nManagement continually assesses whether recorded regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as:\n•\napplicable regulatory environment changes;\n•\nhistorical regulatory treatment for similar costs in Duke Energy’s jurisdictions;\n•\nlitigation of rate orders;\n•\nrecent rate orders to other regulated entities;\n•\nlevels of actual return on equity compared to approved rates of return on equity; and\n•\nthe status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation.\nIf future recovery of costs ceases to be probable, asset write-offs would be recognized in operating income. Additionally, regulatory agencies can provide flexibility in the manner and timing of the depreciation of property, plant and equipment, recognition of asset retirement costs and amortization of regulatory assets, or may disallow recovery of all or a portion of certain assets.\nAs required by regulated operations accounting rules, significant judgment can be required to determine if an otherwise recognizable incurred cost qualifies to be deferred for future recovery as a regulatory asset. Significant judgment can also be required to determine if revenues previously recognized are for entity specific costs that are no longer expected to be incurred or have not yet been incurred and are therefore a regulatory liability.\nFor further information, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nGoodwill Impairment Assessments\nDuke Energy performed its annual goodwill impairment tests for all reporting units as of August 31, 2021. Additionally, Duke Energy monitors all relevant events and circumstances during the year to determine if an interim impairment test is required. Such events and circumstances include an adverse regulatory outcome, declining financial performance and deterioration of industry or market conditions. As of August 31, 2021, all of the reporting units' estimated fair value of equity substantially exceeded the carrying value of equity. The fair values of the reporting units were calculated using a weighted combination of the income approach, which estimates fair value based on discounted cash flows, and the market approach, which estimates fair value based on market comparables within the utility and energy industries.\nEstimated future cash flows under the income approach are based on Duke Energy’s internal business plan. Significant assumptions used are growth rates, future rates of return expected to result from ongoing rate regulation and discount rates. Management determines the appropriate discount rate for each of its reporting units based on the WACC for each individual reporting unit. The WACC takes into account both the after-tax cost of debt and cost of equity. A major component of the cost of equity is the current risk-free rate on 20-year U.S. Treasury bonds. In the 2021 impairment tests, Duke Energy considered implied WACCs for certain peer companies in determining the appropriate WACC rates to use in its analysis. As each reporting unit has a different risk profile based on the nature of its operations, including factors such as regulation, the WACC for each reporting unit may differ. Accordingly, the WACCs were adjusted, as appropriate, to account for company specific risk premiums. The discount rates used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2021, for each of Duke Energy’s reporting units ranged from 5.4% to 5.8%. The underlying assumptions and estimates are made as of a point in time. Subsequent changes, particularly changes in the discount rates, authorized regulated rates of return or growth rates inherent in management’s estimates of future cash flows, could result in future impairment charges.\n57\nOne of the most significant assumptions utilized in determining the fair value of reporting units under the market approach is implied market multiples for certain peer companies. Management selects comparable peers based on each peer’s primary business mix, operations, and market capitalization compared to the applicable reporting unit and calculates implied market multiples based on available projected earnings guidance and peer company market values as of August 31. The implied market multiples used for calculating the fair values as of August 31, 2021, for each of Duke Energy's reporting units ranged from 9.7 to 12.7.\nDuke Energy primarily operates in environments that are rate-regulated. In such environments, revenue requirements are adjusted periodically by regulators based on factors including levels of costs, sales volumes and costs of capital. Accordingly, Duke Energy’s regulated utilities operate to some degree with a buffer from the direct effects, positive or negative, of significant swings in market or economic conditions. However, significant changes in discount rates or implied market multiples over a prolonged period may have a material impact on the fair value of equity.\nDuke Energy has approximately $19.3 billion in Goodwill at both December 31, 2021, and 2020. For further information, see Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Goodwill and Intangible Assets.\"\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment at the present value of the projected liability in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. Duke Energy has approximately $12.8 billion and $13 billion of AROs as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. See Note 9, \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" for further details including a rollforward of related liabilities.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding the amount and timing of future cash flows, regulatory, legal, and legislative decisions, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change.\nObligations for nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress assume prompt dismantlement of the nuclear facilities after operations are ceased. During 2020, Duke Energy Florida, closed an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of the Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station after receiving approval from the NRC and FPSC. The retirement obligations for the decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3 nuclear power station are measured based on accelerated decommissioning from 2020 continuing through 2027. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also assume that spent fuel will be stored on-site until such time that it can be transferred to a yet to be built DOE facility.\nObligations for closure of ash basins are based upon discounted cash flows of estimated costs for site-specific plans. Certain ash basins have had probability weightings applied to them based on different potential closure methods and the probabilities surrounding pending legal changes.\nFor further information, see Notes 3, 4 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" \"Commitments and Contingencies\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations.\"\nLong-Lived Asset Impairment Assessments, Excluding Regulated Operations\nDuke Energy evaluates property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances (such as a significant change in cash flow projections or the determination that it is more likely than not that an asset or asset group will be sold) indicate the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable. The determination of whether an impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows attributable to the assets, as compared with their carrying value.\nPerforming an impairment evaluation involves a significant degree of estimation and judgment in areas such as identifying circumstances that indicate an impairment may exist, identifying and grouping affected assets and developing the undiscounted future cash flows. If an impairment has occurred, the amount of the impairment recognized is determined by estimating the fair value and recording a loss if the carrying value is greater than the fair value. Additionally, determining fair value requires probability weighting future cash flows to reflect expectations about possible variations in their amounts or timing and the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Although cash flow estimates are based on relevant information available at the time the estimates are made, estimates of future cash flows are, by nature, highly uncertain and may vary significantly from actual results. When determining whether an asset or asset group has been impaired, management groups assets at the lowest level that has discrete cash flows.\nDuring 2021, Duke Energy evaluated recoverability of certain renewable merchant plants due to changing market pricing and declining long-term forecasted energy prices, primarily driven by lower long-term forecasted natural gas prices, capital cost of new renewables and increased renewable penetration. It was determined the assets were all recoverable as the carrying value of the assets approximated or were less than the aggregate estimated future cash flows. Duke Energy has approximately $200 million and $210 million in Property, plant and equipment related to these assets as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nWorkplace and workforce realignment has been a focus for the company and costs have been incurred attributable to business transformation, including long-term real estate strategy changes and workforce realignment. For further information, see Notes 2 and 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Business Segments\" and \"Property, Plant and Equipment.\"\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefits\nThe calculation of pension expense, other post-retirement benefit expense and net pension and other post-retirement assets or liabilities require the use of assumptions and election of permissible accounting alternatives. Changes in assumptions can result in different expense and reported asset or liability amounts and future actual experience can differ from the assumptions. Duke Energy believes the most critical assumptions for pension and other post-retirement benefits are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate applied to future projected benefit payments.\n58\nDuke Energy elects to amortize net actuarial gain or loss amounts that are in excess of 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation, into net pension or other post-retirement benefit expense over the average remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period. Prior service cost or credit, which represents an increase or decrease in a plan's pension benefit obligation resulting from plan amendment, is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average expected remaining service period of active participants expected to benefit under the plan. If all or almost all of a plan's participants are inactive, the average remaining life expectancy of the inactive participants is used instead of average remaining service period.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of 6.50%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension liability. Real assets, return-seeking fixed income, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers on investments.\nDuke Energy discounted its future U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a rate of 2.90% as of December 31, 2021. Discount rates used to measure benefit plan obligations for financial reporting purposes reflect rates at which pension benefits could be effectively settled. As of December 31, 2021, Duke Energy determined its discount rate for U.S. pension and other post-retirement obligations using a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nFuture changes in plan asset returns, assumed discount rates and various other factors related to the participants in Duke Energy’s pension and post-retirement plans will impact future pension expense and liabilities. Duke Energy cannot predict with certainty what these factors will be in the future. The following table presents the approximate effect on Duke Energy’s 2022 pretax pension expense, pretax other post-retirement expense, pension obligation and other post-retirement benefit obligation if a 0.25% change in rates were to occur.\nFor further information, see Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Employee Benefit Plans.”\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nSources and Uses of Cash\nDuke Energy relies primarily upon cash flows from operations, debt and equity issuances and its existing cash and cash equivalents to fund its liquidity and capital requirements. Duke Energy’s capital requirements arise primarily from capital and investment expenditures, repaying long-term debt and paying dividends to shareholders. Additionally, due to its existing tax attributes, Duke Energy does not expect to be a significant federal cash taxpayer until around 2030.\n59\nCapital Expenditures\nDuke Energy continues to focus on reducing risk and positioning its business for future success and will invest principally in its strongest business sectors. Duke Energy’s projected capital and investment expenditures, including AFUDC debt and capitalized interest, for the next three fiscal years are included in the table below.\nDebt\nLong-term debt maturities and the interest payable on long-term debt each represent a significant cash requirement for the Duke Energy Registrants. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for information regarding the Duke Energy Registrants' long-term debt at December 31, 2021, the weighted average interest rate applicable to each long-term debt category and a schedule of long-term debt maturities over the next five years.\nFuel and Purchased Power\nFuel and purchased power includes firm capacity payments that provide Duke Energy with uninterrupted firm access to electricity transmission capacity and natural gas transportation contracts, as well as undesignated contracts and contracts that qualify as NPNS. Duke Energy’s contractual cash obligations for fuel and purchased power as of December 31, 2021, are as follows:\nOther Purchase Obligations\nOther purchase obligations includes contracts for software, telephone, data and consulting or advisory services, contractual obligations for EPC costs for new generation plants, wind and solar facilities, plant refurbishments, maintenance and day-to-day contract work and commitments to buy certain products. Amount excludes certain open purchase orders for services that are provided on demand f\nor which the timing of the purchase cannot be determined. Total cash commitments for related other purchase obligation expenditures are $7,941 million, with $7,526 million\nexpected to be paid in the next 12 months.\nSee Note 5 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Leases” for a schedule of both finance lease and operating lease payments over the next five years. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations” for information on nuclear decommissioning trust funding obligations and the closure of ash impoundments.\nDuke Energy performs ongoing assessments of its respective guarantee obligations to determine whether any liabilities have been incurred as a result of potential increased nonperformance risk by third parties for which Duke Energy has issued guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and Indemnifications,” for further details of the guarantee arrangements. Issuance of these guarantee arrangements is not required for the majority of Duke Energy’s operations. Thus, if Duke Energy discontinued issuing these guarantees, there would not be a material impact to the consolidated results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Other than the guarantee arrangements discussed in Note 7 and off-balance sheet debt related to non-consolidated VIEs, Duke Energy does not have any material off-balance sheet financing entities or structures. For additional information, see Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Variable Interest Entities.\"\nCash and Liquidity\nThe Subsidiary Registrants generally maintain minimal cash balances and use short-term borrowings to meet their working capital needs and other cash requirements. The Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, support their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its other subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. The companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating under this arrangement. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Debt and Credit Facilities,” for additional discussion of the money pool arrangement.\n60\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may also use short-term debt, including commercial paper and the money pool, as a bridge to long-term debt financings. The levels of borrowing may vary significantly over the course of the year due to the timing of long-term debt financings and the impact of fluctuations in cash flows from operations. From time to time, Duke Energy’s current liabilities exceed current assets resulting from the use of short-term debt as a funding source to meet scheduled maturities of long-term debt, as well as cash needs, which can fluctuate due to the seasonality of its businesses.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Duke Energy had approximately $343 million of cash on hand, $5.0 billion available under its $8 billion Master Credit Facility and $500 million available under the $1 billion Three-Year Revolving Credit Facility. Duke Energy expects to have sufficient liquidity in the form of cash on hand, cash from operations and available credit capacity to support its funding needs. Additionally, by January 2023, Duke Energy is expecting another $1,025 million from GIC for the second closing of the investment in Duke Energy Indiana. Proceeds from the minority interest investment are expected to partially fund Duke Energy's $63 billion capital and investment expenditure plan. Refer to Notes 6 and 19 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Stockholders' Equity,\" respectively, for information regarding Duke Energy's debt and equity issuances, debt maturities and available credit facilities including the Master Credit Facility.\nCredit Facilities and Registration Statements\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding credit facilities and shelf registration statements available to Duke Energy and the Duke Energy Registrants.\nDividend Payments\nIn 2021, Duke Energy paid quarterly cash dividends for the 95th consecutive year and expects to continue its policy of paying regular cash dividends in the future. There is no assurance as to the amount of future dividends because they depend on future earnings, capital requirements, financial condition and are subject to the discretion of the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy targets a dividend payout ratio of betwe\nen 65% and 75%,\nbased upon adjusted EPS. Duke Energy increased the dividend by approxima\ntely 2%\nannually in both 2021 and 2020, and the company remains committed to continued growth of the dividend.\nDividend and Other Funding Restrictions of Duke Energy Subsidiaries\nAs discussed in Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Regulatory Matters,” Duke Energy’s wholly owned public utility operating companies have restrictions on the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy through dividends, advances or loans as a result of conditions imposed by various regulators in conjunction with merger transactions. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures and Articles of Incorporation, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Additionally, certain other Duke Energy subsidiaries have other restrictions, such as minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements pursuant to debt and other agreements that limit the amount of funds that can be transferred to Duke Energy. At December 31, 2021, the amount of restricted net assets of wholly owned subsidiaries of Duke Energy that may not be distributed to Duke Energy in the form of a loan or dividend does not exceed a material amount of Duke Energy’s net assets. Duke Energy does not have any legal or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders out of its consolidated equity accounts. Although these restrictions cap the amount of funding the various operating subsidiaries can provide to Duke Energy, management does not believe these restrictions will have a significant impact on Duke Energy’s ability to access cash to meet its payment of dividends on common stock and other future funding obligations.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operations of Electric Utilities and Infrastructure and Gas Utilities and Infrastructure are primarily driven by sales of electricity and natural gas, respectively, and costs of operations. These cash flows from operations are relatively stable and comprise a substantial portion of Duke Energy’s operating cash flows. Weather conditions, working capital and commodity price fluctuations and unanticipated expenses including unplanned plant outages, storms, legal costs and related settlements can affect the timing and level of cash flows from operations.\nAs part of Duke Energy’s continued effort to improve its cash flows from operations and liquidity, Duke Energy works with vendors to improve terms and conditions, including the extension of payment terms. To support this effort, Duke Energy established a supply chain finance program (the “program”) in 2020, under which suppliers, at their sole discretion, may sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the participating financial institution. The financial institution administers the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier’s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program. Suppliers’ decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy’s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. A significant deterioration in the credit quality of Duke Energy, economic downturn or changes in the financial markets could limit the financial institutions willingness to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not believe such risk would have a material impact on our cash flows from operations or liquidity, as substantially all our payments are made outside the program.\nDuke Energy believes it has sufficient liquidity resources through the commercial paper markets, and ultimately, the Master Credit Facility, to support these operations. Cash flows from operations are subject to a number of other factors, including, but not limited to, regulatory constraints, economic trends and market volatility (see Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” for additional information).\nDebt Issuances\nDepending on availability based on the issuing entity, the credit rating of the issuing entity, and market conditions, the Subsidiary Registrants prefer to issue first mortgage bonds and secured debt, followed by unsecured debt. This preference is the result of generally higher credit ratings for first mortgage bonds and secured debt, which typically result in lower interest costs. Duke Energy Corporation primarily issues unsecured debt.\n61\nIn 2022, Duke Energy anticipates issuing additional securities of $9.5 billion through debt capital markets.\nIn certain instances Duke Energy may utilize instruments other than senior notes, including equity-content securities such as subordinated debt or preferred stock. Proceeds will primarily be for the purpose of funding capital expenditures and debt maturities. See to Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities,\" for further information regarding significant debt issuances in 2021.\nDuke Energy’s capitalization is balanced between debt and equity as shown in the table below.\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nDuke Energy’s debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio to not exceed 65% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and 70% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements or sublimits thereto. As of December 31, 2021, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\nCredit Ratings\nMoody’s Investors Service, Inc. and S&P provide credit ratings for various Duke Energy Registrants. The following table includes Duke Energy and certain subsidiaries’ credit ratings and ratings outlook as of February 2022.\nCredit ratings are intended to provide credit lenders a framework for comparing the credit quality of securities and are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold. The Duke Energy Registrants’ credit ratings are dependent on the rating agencies’ assessments of their ability to meet their debt principal and interest obligations when they come due. If, as a result of market conditions or other factors, the Duke Energy Registrants are unable to maintain current balance sheet strength, or if earnings and cash flow outlook materially deteriorates, credit ratings could be negatively impacted.\n62\nCash Flow Information\nThe following table summarizes Duke Energy’s cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nOPERATING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s operating cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $572 million refund of AMT credit carryforwards in the prior year; and\n•\na $149 million increase in cash outflows from working capital primarily due to an increase in under collected fuel used in generation due to higher pricing, partially offset by coal ash insurance litigation proceeds, fluctuations in accounts payable levels and timing of property tax accruals and payments in the current year.\nPartially offset by:\n•\nan $85 million increase in net income after adjustment for non-cash items primarily due to higher revenues from rate cases in various jurisdictions, higher retail sales volumes and the prior year coal ash settlement agreement filed with the NCUC, partially offset by an impairment charge related to the South Carolina Supreme Court Decision on coal ash, higher depreciation, amortization and accretion and interest expense; and\n•\na $70 million decrease in payments for AROs.\nINVESTING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s investing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\n63\nThe variance relates primarily to a payment made to fund ACP's outstanding debt, partially offset by a decrease in capital expenditures due to lower overall investments in the Commercial Renewables segment. The primary use of cash related to investing activities is typically capital, investment and acquisition expenditures, net of return of investment capital detailed by reportable business segment in the following table.\nFINANCING CASH FLOWS\nThe following table summarizes key components of Duke Energy’s financing cash flows for the two most recently completed fiscal years.\nThe variance was driven primarily by:\n•\na $1,934 million net increase in proceeds from issuances of long-term debt, primarily due to timing of issuances and redemptions of long-term debt;\n•\na $1,149 million increase in contributions from noncontrolling interests, primarily due to a $1,025 million receipt from GIC to make an indirect minority interest investment of 11.05% in Duke Energy Indiana; and\n•\na $798 million increase in net borrowings from notes payable and commercial paper.\nPartially offset by:\n•\na $2,740 million decrease in proceeds from the issuance of common stock.\nQUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nRisk Management Policies\nThe Enterprise Risk Management policy framework at Duke Energy includes strategy, operational, project execution and financial or transaction related risks. Enterprise Risk Management includes market risk as part of the financial and transaction related risks in its framework.\nDuke Energy is exposed to market risks associated with commodity prices, interest rates and equity prices. Duke Energy has established comprehensive risk management policies to monitor and manage these market risks. Duke Energy’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer are responsible for the overall approval of market risk management policies and the delegation of approval and authorization levels. The Finance and Risk Management Committee of the Board of Directors receives periodic updates from the Chief Risk Officer and other members of management on market risk positions, corporate exposures and overall risk management activities. The Chief Risk Officer is responsible for the overall governance of managing commodity price risk, including monitoring exposure limits.\nThe following disclosures about market risk contain forward-looking statements that involve estimates, projections, goals, forecasts, assumptions, risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements. See Item 1A, “Risk Factors,” and “Cautionary Statement Regarding Forward-Looking Information” for a discussion of the factors that may impact any such forward-looking statements made herein.\nCommodity Price Risk\nPrice risk represents the potential risk of loss from adverse changes in the market price of electricity or other energy commodities. Duke Energy’s exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors, including the effects of regulation, commodity contract size and length, market liquidity, market conditions, location and unique or specific contract terms. Duke Energy is exposed to the impact of market fluctuations in the prices of electricity, coal, natural gas and other energy-related products marketed and purchased as a result of its ownership of energy-related assets.\n64\nDuke Energy’s exposure to these fluctuations through its regulated utility operations is limited since these operations are subject to cost-based regulation and are typically allowed to recover substantially all of these costs through various cost recovery clauses, including fuel clauses, formula-based contracts, or other cost-sharing mechanisms. While there may be a delay in timing between when these costs are incurred and when they are recovered through rates, changes from year to year generally do not have a material impact on operating results of these regulated operations.\nWithin Duke Energy’s Commercial Renewables segment, the company has exposure to market price fluctuations in prices of electricity or other energy-related products as a result of its ownership of renewable assets, although its exposure to the market price of power is generally limited by entering into contracts with third parties to sell the production of these assets, usually for a term of 10 to 15 years from commercial operation.\nDuke Energy employs established policies and procedures to manage risks associated with these market fluctuations, which may include using various commodity derivatives, such as swaps, futures, forwards and options. For additional information, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Derivatives and Hedging.”\nGeneration Portfolio Risks\nFor the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment, the generation portfolio not utilized to serve retail operations or committed load is subject to commodity price fluctuations. However, the impact on the Consolidated Statements of Operations is limited due to mechanisms in these regulated jurisdictions that result in the sharing of most of the net profits from these activities with retail customers.\nThe majority of the energy assets in Duke Energy’s Commercial Renewables segment operate in regions managed by RTOs and are therefore governed and dispatched under the rules of the applicable RTO. Depending on the structure of power sale agreements with third parties, these assets may be exposed to basis risk associated with different locational marginal prices based on the specific delivery locations and requirements specified in the agreements. Additionally, these assets may be subject to operational constraints under the RTO rules and may be exposed to market price risk\n.\nHedging Strategies\nDuke Energy monitors risks associated with commodity price changes on its future operations and, where appropriate, uses various commodity instruments such as electricity, coal and natural gas hedging contracts and options to mitigate the effect of such fluctuations on operations. Duke Energy’s primary use of energy commodity derivatives is to hedge against exposure to the prices of power, fuel for generation and natural gas for customers. Additionally, Duke Energy’s Commercial Renewables business may enter into short-term or long-term hedge agreements to manage price risk associated with project output to the extent such output is not under contract to third parties.\nDuke Energy also manages its exposure to basis risk through the use of congestion hedge products in RTOs such as financial transmission rights (PJM) and congestion revenue rights (ERCOT), which result in payments based on differentials in locational marginal prices. The majority of instruments used to manage Duke Energy’s commodity price exposure are either not designated as hedges or do not qualify for hedge accounting. These instruments are referred to as undesignated contracts. Mark-to-market changes for undesignated contracts entered into by regulated businesses are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Undesignated contracts entered into by nonregulated businesses are marked-to-market each period, with changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments reflected in earnings.\nDuke Energy may also enter into other contracts that qualify for the NPNS exception. When a contract meets the criteria to qualify as NPNS, Duke Energy applies such exception. Income recognition and realization related to NPNS contracts generally coincide with the physical delivery of the commodity. For contracts qualifying for the NPNS exception, no recognition of the contract’s fair value in the Consolidated Financial Statements is required until settlement of the contract as long as the transaction remains probable of occurring.\nInterest Rate Risk\nDuke Energy is exposed to risk resulting from changes in interest rates as a result of its issuance or anticipated issuance of variable and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Duke Energy manages interest rate exposure by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates. Duke Energy also enters into financial derivative instruments, which may include instruments such as, but not limited to, interest rate swaps, swaptions and U.S. Treasury lock agreements to manage and mitigate interest rate risk exposure. See Notes 1, 6, 14 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” “Debt and Credit Facilities,” “Derivatives and Hedging,” and “Fair Value Measurements.”\nDuke Energy h\nad $7.5 billion of unhedged long- and short-term floating interest rate exposure at December 31, 2021. The impact of a 100-basis point change in interest rates on pretax income is approximately $75 million\nat December 31, 2021. This amount was estimated by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on variable-rate securities outstanding, adjusted for interest rate hedges as of December 31, 2021.\nCertain Duke Energy Registrants have variable-rate debt and manage interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps. See Notes 6 and 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Debt and Credit Facilities\" and \"Derivatives and Hedging.\" Such financial arrangements generally are indexed based upon LIBOR, which is expected to be fully phased out in 2023. The Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) has been identified by regulators and industry participants as the preferred successor rate for U.S. dollar-based LIBOR. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond the phaseout of LIBOR may require contractual amendment or termination and renegotiation to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment, and there may be uncertainty regarding the effectiveness of any such alternative index methodologies. Alternative index provisions are being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond the phaseout of LIBOR. Additionally, the progress of the phaseout is being monitored, including proposed transition relief from the FASB.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk represents the loss that the Duke Energy Registrants would incur if a counterparty fails to perform under its contractual obligations. Where exposed to credit risk, the Duke Energy Registrants analyze the counterparty's financial condition prior to entering into an agreement and monitor exposure on an ongoing basis. The Duke Energy Registrants establish credit limits where appropriate in the context of contractual arrangements and monitor such limits.\n65\nTo reduce credit exposure, the Duke Energy Registrants seek to include netting provisions with counterparties, which permit the offset of receivables and payables with such counterparties. The Duke Energy Registrants also frequently use master agreements with credit support annexes to further mitigate certain credit exposures. The master agreements provide for a counterparty to post cash or letters of credit to the exposed party for exposure in excess of an established threshold. The threshold amount represents a negotiated unsecured credit limit for each party to the agreement, determined in accordance with the Duke Energy Registrants’ internal corporate credit practices and standards. Collateral agreements generally also provide that the failure to post collateral when required is sufficient cause to terminate transactions and liquidate all positions.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also obtain cash, letters of credit, or surety bonds from certain counterparties to provide credit support outside of collateral agreements, where appropriate, based on a financial analysis of the counterparty and the regulatory or contractual terms and conditions applicable to each transaction. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Derivatives and Hedging,” for additional information regarding credit risk related to derivative instruments.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ principal counterparties for its electric and natural gas businesses are RTOs, distribution companies, municipalities, electric cooperatives and utilities located throughout the U.S. Exposure to these entities consists primarily of amounts due to Duke Energy Registrants for delivered electricity. Additionally, there may be potential risks associated with remarketing of energy and capacity in the event of default by wholesale power customers. The Duke Energy Registrants have concentrations of receivables from certain of such entities that may affect the Duke Energy Registrants’ credit risk.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to credit risk from transactions with their suppliers that involve prepayments or milestone payments in conjunction with outsourcing arrangements, major construction projects and certain commodity purchases. The Duke Energy Registrants’ credit exposure to such suppliers may take the form of increased costs or project delays in the event of nonperformance. The Duke Energy Registrants' frequently require guarantees or letters of credit from suppliers to mitigate this credit risk.\nCredit risk associated with the Duke Energy Registrants’ service to residential, commercial and industrial customers is generally limited to outstanding accounts receivable. The Duke Energy Registrants mitigate this credit risk by requiring tariff customers to provide a cash deposit, letter of credit or surety bond until a satisfactory payment history is established, subject to the rules and regulations in effect in each retail jurisdiction at which time the deposit is typically refunded. Charge-offs for retail customers have historically been insignificant to the operations of the Duke Energy Registrants and are typically recovered through retail rates. Management continually monitors customer charge-offs, payment patterns and the impact of current economic conditions on customers' ability to pay their outstanding balance to ensure the adequacy of bad debt reserves.\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, in March 2020, the Duke Energy Registrants announced a suspension of disconnections for nonpayment as a result of the national emergency. While disconnections have resumed, the company continued to offer flexible options to customers struggling with the pandemic and the economic fallout, including extended payment arrangements to satisfy delinquent balances through June 2021. Since then, the company has resumed standard payment arrangement options . The Duke Energy Registrants are still monitoring the effects of the resultant economic slowdown on counterparties’ abilities to perform under their contractual obligations. The Duke Energy Registrants have observed a significant increase in utility account arrears as of December 31, 2021. There is an expectation of an increase in charge-offs in the future and the Duke Energy Registrants have reserved for these losses in the allowance for doubtful account balance. See Notes 3 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Revenue,\" respectively, for more information.\nDuke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell certain of their accounts receivable and related collections through CRC, a Duke Energy consolidated VIE. Losses on collection are first absorbed by the equity of CRC and next by the subordinated retained interests held by Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Kentucky and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Variable Interest Entities.”\nThe Duke Energy Registrants provide certain non-tariff services, primarily to large commercial and industrial customers in which incurred costs, including invested capital, are intended to be recovered from the individual customer and therefore are not subject to rate recovery in the event of customer default. Customer creditworthiness is assessed prior to entering into these transactions. Credit concentration related to these transactions exists for certain of these customers.\nDuke Energy’s Commercial Renewables segment enters into long-term agreements with certain creditworthy buyers that may not include the right to call for collateral in the event of a credit rating downgrade. Credit concentration exists to certain counterparties on these agreements, including entities that could be subject to wildfire liability. Additionally, Commercial Renewables may invest in projects for which buyers are below investment grade, although such buyers are required to post negotiated amounts of credit support. Also, power sales agreements and/or hedges of project output are generally for an initial term that does not cover the entire life of the asset. As a result, Commercial Renewables is exposed to market price risk and credit risk related to these agreements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. See Note 4 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for information on asbestos-related injuries and damages claims.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants also have credit risk exposure through issuance of performance and financial guarantees, letters of credit and surety bonds on behalf of less than wholly owned entities and third parties. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued these guarantees, it is possible that they could be required to perform under these guarantee obligations in the event the obligor under the guarantee fails to perform. Where the Duke Energy Registrants have issued guarantees related to assets or operations that have been disposed of via sale, they attempt to secure indemnification from the buyer against all future performance obligations under the guarantees. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Guarantees and Indemnifications,” for further information on guarantees issued by the Duke Energy Registrants.\nBased on the Duke Energy Registrants’ policies for managing credit risk, their exposures and their credit and other reserves, the Duke Energy Registrants do not currently anticipate a materially adverse effect on their consolidated financial position or results of operations as a result of nonperformance by any counterparty.\n66\nMarketable Securities Price Risk\nAs described further in Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” Duke Energy invests in debt and equity securities as part of various investment portfolios to fund certain obligations. The vast majority of investments in equity securities are within the NDTF and assets of the various pension and other post-retirement benefit plans.\nPension Plan Assets\nDuke Energy maintains investments to facilitate funding the costs of providing non-contributory defined benefit retirement and other post-retirement benefit plans. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. The equity securities held in these pension plans are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of any single investment, sector or geographic region. Duke Energy has established asset allocation targets for its pension plan holdings, which take into consideration the investment objectives and the risk profile with respect to the trust in which the assets are held. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Employee Benefit Plans,” for additional information regarding investment strategy of pension plan assets.\nA significant decline in the value of plan asset holdings could require Duke Energy to increase funding of its pension plans in future periods, which could adversely affect cash flows in those periods. Additionally, a decline in the fair value of plan assets, absent additional cash contributions to the plan, could increase the amount of pension cost required to be recorded in future periods, which could adversely affect Duke Energy’s results of operations in those periods.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nAs required by the NRC, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC, subsidiaries of Duke Energy maintain trust funds to fund the costs of nuclear decommissioning. As of December 31, 2021, these funds were invested primarily in domestic and international equity securities, debt securities, cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments. Per the NRC, Internal Revenue Code, NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC requirements, these funds may be used only for activities related to nuclear decommissioning. These investments are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets and changes in interest rates. Duke Energy actively monitors its portfolios by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining, and periodically reviewing, target allocation percentages for various asset classes.\nAccounting for nuclear decommissioning recognizes that costs are recovered through retail and wholesale rates; therefore, fluctuations in investment prices do not materially affect the Consolidated Statements of Operations, as changes in the fair value of these investments are primarily deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities pursuant to Orders by the NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and FERC. Earnings or losses of the funds will ultimately impact the amount of costs recovered through retail and wholesale rates. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Asset Retirement Obligations,” for additional information regarding nuclear decommissioning costs. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Investments in Debt and Equity Securities,” for additional information regarding NDTF assets.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEnvironmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local regulations regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These regulations can be changed from time to time and result in new obligations of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe following sections outline various proposed and recently enacted legislation and regulations that may impact the Duke Energy Registrants. Refer to Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters,\" for further information regarding potential plant retirements and regulatory filings related to the Duke Energy Registrants.\nCoal Combustion Residuals\nIn April 2015, EPA published a rule to regulate the disposal of CCR from electric utilities as solid waste. The federal regulation classifies CCR as nonhazardous waste and allows for beneficial use of CCR with some restrictions. The regulation applies to all new and existing landfills, new and existing surface impoundments receiving CCR and existing surface impoundments located at stations generating electricity (regardless of fuel source), which were no longer receiving CCR but contained liquids as of the effective date of the rule. The rule establishes requirements regarding landfill design, structural integrity design and assessment criteria for surface impoundments, groundwater monitoring, protection and remedial procedures and other operational and reporting procedures to ensure the safe disposal and management of CCR.\nOn July 17, 2018, EPA issued a final rule (Phase 1, Part 1) revising certain closure deadlines and groundwater protection standards in the CCR rule. The rule does not change the primary requirements for groundwater monitoring, corrective action, inspections and maintenance, and closure, and thus does not materially affect Duke Energy’s coal ash basin closure plans or compliance obligations under the CCR rule. On October 22, 2018, a coalition of environmental groups filed a petition for review in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia (D.C. Circuit Court) challenging EPA's final Phase 1, Part 1 revisions to the CCR rule. On March 13, 2019, the D.C. Circuit Court issued an order in the Phase 1, Part 1 litigation granting EPA’s motion to remand the rule without vacatur. To date, EPA has finalized two notice-and-comment rulemakings to implement the court’s decision on remand. The “Part A” rule, which was promulgated on August 28, 2020, establishes an April 11, 2021 deadline to cease placement of CCR and non-CCR waste streams into unlined ash basins and initiate closure, and the “Part B” rule, which was promulgated on November 12, 2020, establishes procedures to allow facilities to request approval to operate an existing CCR surface impoundment with an alternate liner.\nIn addition to the requirements of the federal CCR rule, CCR landfills and surface impoundments will continue to be regulated by the states. Cost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions and via wholesale contracts, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. For more information, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and \"Asset Retirement Obligations,\" respectively.\n67\nCoal Ash Act\nAROs recorded on the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of the Coal Ash Act, the EPA CCR rule and other agreements. The Coal Ash Act includes a variance procedure for compliance deadlines and other issues surrounding the management of CCR and CCR surface impoundments and prohibits cost recovery in customer rates for unlawful discharge of ash impoundment waters occurring after January 1, 2014. The Coal Ash Act leaves the decision on cost recovery determinations related to closure of ash impoundments to the normal ratemaking processes before utility regulatory commissions.\nConsistent with the requirements of the Coal Ash Act, Duke Energy previously submitted comprehensive site assessments and groundwater corrective action plans to NCDEQ. In addition, on December 31, 2019, Duke Energy submitted updated groundwater corrective action plans and site-specific coal ash impoundment closure plans to NCDEQ.\nOn April 1, 2019, NCDEQ issued a closure determination requiring Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to excavate all remaining coal ash impoundments at the Allen, Belews Creek, Rogers, Marshall, Mayo and Roxboro facilities in North Carolina. On April 26, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed Petitions for Contested Case Hearings in the Office of Administrative Hearings to challenge NCDEQ's April 1 Order. On December 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into a settlement agreement with NCDEQ and certain community groups under which Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed to excavate seven of the nine remaining coal ash basins at these sites with ash moved to on-site lined landfills, including two at Allen, one at Belews Creek, one at Mayo, one at Roxboro, and two at Rogers. At the two remaining basins at Marshall and Roxboro, uncapped basin ash will be excavated and moved to lined landfills. Those portions of the basins at Marshall and Roxboro, which were previously filled with ash and on which permitted facilities were constructed, will not be disturbed and will be closed pursuant to other state regulations.\nFollowing NCDEQ's April 1 Order, Duke Energy estimated the incremental undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining impoundments by excavation would be approximately $4 billion to $5 billion, potentially increasing the total estimated costs to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina to $9.5 billion to $10.5 billion. The settlement lowers the estimated total undiscounted cost to close the nine remaining basins by excavation by approximately $1.5 billion as compared to Duke Energy’s original estimate that followed the order. As a result, the estimated total cost to permanently close all ash basins in North Carolina and South Carolina is approximately $8 billion to $9 billion of which approximat\nely $3.1 billion has been spent through 2021. The\nmajority of the remaining spend is expected to occur over the next 15 to 20 years.\nDuke Energy has completed excavation of all coal ash at the Riverbend, Dan River and Sutton plants.\nFor further information on ash basins and recovery, see Notes 3 and 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters\" and “Asset Retirement Obligations,” respectively.\nNorth Carolina House Bill 951\nOn October 13, 2021, North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper signed into law legislation passed by the North Carolina House of Representatives and Senate (the “Legislation”). This Legislation establishes a framework overseen by the NCUC to advance state CO\n2\nemissions reductions through the use of least cost planning while providing for continued reliability and affordable rates for customers served by such generation. It also authorizes the use of performance-based regulation in North Carolina. Among other things, the Legislation requires the NCUC to:\n•\ndevelop an initial carbon plan that would target a 70% reduction in CO\n2\nemissions from public utilities' electric generation in the state by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology;\n•\nadopt rules to implement the requirements of the Legislation authorizing performance-based regulation that includes multiyear rate plans with a maximum three-year term, performance incentive mechanisms to track utility performance, and revenue decoupling for the residential customer class;\n•\nestablish rules to securitize costs associated with the early retirement of subcritical coal-fired electric generating facilities necessary to achieve the authorized carbon reduction goals at 50% of remaining net book value, with the remaining net book value recovered through normal cost of service basis; and\n•\ninitiate a process for updating rates and terms of certain existing solar power purchase agreements executed under PURPA.\nOther Environmental Regulations\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are also subject to various federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal and other environmental matters. Duke Energy continues to comply with enacted environmental statutes and regulations even as certain of these regulations are in various stages of clarification, revision or legal challenge. The Duke Energy Registrants cannot predict the outcome of these matters.\nGlobal Climate Change and Regulation of GHG Emissions\nIn 2021, President Biden recommitted the United States to the Paris Agreement and announced a new target for the United States of 50% - 52% reduction in economywide net GHG emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The U.S. submittal to support this Paris target includes a goal for 100% carbon-free electricity by 2035. These actions have been supplemented by a number of executive orders by President Biden and an indication by a number of regulatory agencies, including the EPA, that they would impose additional regulations on CO\n2\nand methane emissions to which Duke Energy will be subject. The Duke Energy Registrants are monitoring these matters and cannot predict the outcome, however, there could be a material impact on our climate strategy.\n68\nCO\n2\nEmissions Reductions\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ direct GHG emissions consist primarily of CO\n2\nthat results primarily from operating a fleet of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants to serve its customers reliably and affordably. On September 17, 2019, Duke Energy announced an updated climate strategy with new goals of at least 50% reduction in carbon emissions from electric generation by 2030 and net-zero carbon emissions from electric generation by 2050. The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in a reduction of CO\n2\nemissions over time.\nBetween 2005 and 2021, the Duke Energy Registrants have collectively lowered the CO\n2\nemissions from their electricity generation by 44%. T\nimelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of GHG emissions will vary in each state in which the company operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. The goals announced in 2019, as well as the actions taken to reduce CO\n2\nemissions, potentially lower the exposure to any future mandatory CO\n2\nemission reduction requirements, whether as a result of federal legislation, EPA regulation, state regulation or other as yet unknown emission reduction requirement.\nActions to reduce CO\n2\nemissions have included the retirement of 56 coal-fired electric generating units with a combined generating capacity of 7,500 MW, while investing in renewables and state-of-the-art highly efficient natural gas-fired generation that produces far fewer CO\n2\nemissions per unit of electricity generated than coal. Duke Energy also has made investments to increase EE offerings and ensure continued operations of its zero-CO\n2\nemissions hydropower and nuclear plants. These efforts have diversified its system and significantly reduced CO\n2\nemissions.\nDuke Energy will continue to explore the use of currently available and commercially demonstrated technology to reduce CO\n2\nemissions, including EE, wind, solar and storage, as well as evolving technologies like carbon capture, utilization and storage, the use of hydrogen and other low-carbon fuels, long-duration storage and advanced nuclear, in its efforts to achieve its net-zero goal as well as to comply with any future regulations. Duke Energy plans to adjust to and incorporate evolving and innovative technologies in a way that balances the reliability and affordability while meeting regulatory requirements and customer demands. Under any future scenario involving mandatory CO\n2\nlimitations, the Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs through appropriate regulatory mechanisms. Future levels of GHG emissions by the Duke Energy Registrants will be influenced by variables that include capacity needs in the jurisdictions in which they operate, public policy, tax incentives, economic conditions that affect electricity demand, fuel prices, market prices, availability of resources and labor, compliance with new or existing regulations, the ability to make enhancements to transmission and distribution systems to support increased renewables, and the existence of new technologies that can be deployed to generate the electricity necessary to meet customer demand.\nCurrently, the Duke Energy Registrants do not purchase carbon credits or offsets for use in connection with the company's net-zero emissions goals. Though they may purchase carbon credits or offsets for such uses in the future , the amount or cost of which is not expected to be material at this time.\nGeneration Mix Planning Process\nThe Duke Energy Registrants annually, biennially or triennially prepare lengthy, forward-looking IRPs. These detailed, highly technical plans are based on the company’s thorough analysis of numerous factors that can impact the cost of producing and delivering electricity that influence long-term generation resource planning decisions. The IRP process helps to evaluate a range of options, taking into account stakeholder input as well as forecasts of future electricity demand, fuel prices, transmission improvements, new generating capacity, integration of renewables, energy storage, EE and demand response initiatives. The IRP process also helps evaluate potential environmental and regulatory scenarios to better mitigate policy and economic risks. The IRPs we file with regulators look out 10 to 20 years depending on the jurisdiction.\nFor a number of years, the Duke Energy Registrants have included a price on CO\n2\nemissions in their IRP planning process to account for the potential regulation of CO\n2\nemissions. Incorporating a price on CO\n2\nemissions in the IRPs allows for the evaluation of existing and future resource needs against potential climate change policy risk in the absence of policy certainty. One of the challenges with using a CO\n2\nprice, especially in the absence of a clear and certain policy, is determining the appropriate price to use. To address this uncertainty and ensure the company remains agile, the Duke Energy Registrants typically use a range of potential CO\n2\nprices to reflect a range of potential policy outcomes.\nIn September 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed their IRPs in North Carolina and South Carolina, and, in December 2021, Duke Energy Indiana filed its IRP, outlining an accelerated energy transition which aligns with the company's 2030 CO\n2\nemissions goal. In December 2021 the PSCSC rejected Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress’ preferred accelerated coal retirements IRP scenario and instead found that the base case without a price on CO2 emissions was the most reasonable IRP scenario.\nIn 2021, the State of North Carolina passed HB 951, which among other things, directs the NCUC to develop and approve a carbon reduction plan by the end of 2022 that would target a 70% reduction in CO\n2\nemissions from Duke Energy Progress' and Duke Energy Carolinas' electric generation in the state by\n2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, considering all resource options and the latest technology.\nIn light of this legislation, in November 2021, the NCUC declined to make a determination on the portfolios presented in the 2020 IRP noting that the legislation may impact the schedule for coal plant retirements and new resources and limited its order to short term actions for use on an interim basis pending preparation of the carbon plan. The NCUC's carbon reduction plan will be informed by Duke Energy's initial carbon plan, which will be filed with the NCUC by May 16, 2022, building on the IRPs that were filed in 2020 by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and incorporating feedback from extensive stakeholder engagement.\nCO\n2\nand Methane Emissions Reductions from the Natural Gas Distribution Business\nIn addition to CO\n2\nemissions resulting primarily from our operations of coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants, the Duke Energy Registrants are also responsible for certain methane emissions from the distribution of natural gas to customers. On October 9, 2020, Duke Energy announced a new goal to achieve net-zero methane emissions from its natural gas distribution business by 2030. The Duke Energy Registrants have taken actions that have resulted in methane emission reductions, including the replacement of cast iron and bare steel pipelines and associated services with plastic or coated steel, advanced methane leak detection efforts, reducing time to repair nonhazardous leaks and operational releases of methane, and investment in renewable natural gas.\nTimelines and initiatives, as well as implementation of new technologies, for future reductions of upstream methane emissions will vary in each state in which the company’s natural gas distribution business operates and will involve collaboration with regulators, customers and other stakeholders. EPA has also proposed regulations that would require reduction of methane emissions upstream of the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution business. The impact of these regulations on natural gas fuel prices is not currently quantifiable.\n69\nIn addition to possible EPA regulation of methane emissions, certain local governments, none within the jurisdictions in which the Duke Energy Registrants operate, have enacted or are considering initiatives to eliminate natural gas use in new buildings and focus on electrification. Enactment of similar regulations in the areas in which the Duke Energy Registrants' natural gas distribution operates could have a significant impact on the natural gas distribution business and its operations. At this time, such impacts are not able to be quantified; however, the net-zero methane goals announced in 2020 for the natural gas distribution business, as well as the actions taken to reduce these GHG emissions, potentially lowers the exposure to any future mandatory GHG emission reduction requirements. The Duke Energy Registrants would plan to seek recovery of their compliance costs with any new regulations through the regulatory process.\nPhysical Impacts of Climate Change\nThe Duke Energy Registrants recognize that scientists associate severe weather events with increasing levels of GHGs in the atmosphere. It is possible that these weather events could have a material impact on future results of operations should they occur more frequently and with greater severity. However, the uncertain nature of potential changes in extreme weather events (such as increased frequency, duration and severity), the long period of time over which any potential changes might take place and the inability to predict potential changes with any degree of accuracy, make estimating with any certainty any potential future financial risk to the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations difficult. Additionally,\nthe Duke Energy Registrants would plan to continue to seek recovery of storm costs through the appropriate regulatory mechanisms. For more information on storm securitization in North Carolina and storm cost recovery in Florida, see Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, \"Regulatory Matters.\"\nThe Duke Energy Registrants routinely take steps to reduce the potential impact of severe weather events on their electric transmission and distribution systems and natural gas facilities. The steps include modernizing the electric grid through smart meters, storm hardening, self-healing systems and targeted undergrounding and applying lessons learned from previous storms to restoration efforts. The Duke Energy Registrants’ electric generating facilities and natural gas facilities are designed to withstand extreme weather events without significant damage. The Duke Energy Registrants maintain inventories of coal, oil and liquified natural gas to mitigate the effects of any potential short-term disruption in fuel supply so they can continue to provide customers with an uninterrupted supply of electricity and/or natural gas.\nNew Accounting Standards\nSee Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” for a discussion of the impact of new accounting standards."

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nRegulatory Matters – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Notes 1, 3, and 9 to the financial statements\n.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to regulation by federal and state utility regulatory agencies (the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the rates of the Company’s electric and natural gas distribution companies. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As discussed in Note 3, regulatory proceedings in recent years in North Carolina and South Carolina have focused on the recoverability of asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders in North Carolina and South Carolina requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $14.6 billion recorded as regulatory assets.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of the recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n73\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commissions, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We also evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s and intervenors’ filings with the Commissions, that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following:\n–\nWe inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year.\n–\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission-approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable.\n–\nWe utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances.\n–\nWe compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance.\n•\nWe obtained an analysis from management and letters from internal legal counsel for asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash costs, regarding probability of recovery for deferred costs not yet addressed in a regulatory order to assess management’s assertion that amounts are probable of recovery.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery.\nNoncontrolling Interests - Minority Interest Investment in Duke Energy Indiana – Refer to Note 1 to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nOn January 28, 2021, the Company executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC Private Limited in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a 19.9% minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction will be completed following two closings for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $2 billion. The first closing occurred on September 8, 2021 and resulted in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC issuing 11.05% of its membership interests in exchange for 50% of the purchase price. The Company retained indirect control of these assets, and, therefore, no gain or loss was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the net cash consideration received and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was recorded as an increase to equity. The Company has the discretion to determine the timing of the second closing, but the closing will occur no later than January 2023.\nWe identified the minority interest investment in Duke Energy Indiana as a critical audit matter because of the extensive audit effort required to audit the transaction, including the need to involve professionals in our firm with the appropriate expertise to assist us in evaluating management’s conclusions that there should be no gain or loss associated with this transaction recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the minority interest investment in Duke Energy Indiana included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the accounting assessment of significant and non- routine transactions, including the controls over the income tax treatment of such transactions.\n•\nWe evaluated management’s conclusions related to accounting for the transaction by:\n–\nObtaining and reading the agreement providing for the minority investment,\n–\nInvolving professionals in our firm with the appropriate expertise to evaluate the work performed by management’s expert related to the tax treatment of the transaction,\n–\nAssessing management’s documentation for accounting for the transaction.\n•\nWe evaluated the appropriateness of the Company’s disclosures related to the minority interest investment.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1947.\n74\nDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n75\nDUKE ENERGY CORPORATION\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\n(a)\nNet of income tax impacts of approximately $\n17\nmillion and $\n35\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.

The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Matters – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Notes 1, 3, and 9 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the North Carolina Utilities Commission and by the South Carolina Public Service Commission (collectively the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the electric rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As discussed in Note 3, regulatory proceedings in recent years in North Carolina and South Carolina have focused on the recoverability of asset retirement obligations specific to coal ash. As a result, assessing the potential outcomes of future regulatory orders in North Carolina and South Carolina requires significant management judgment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $3.5 billion recorded as regulatory assets.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates.

We evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s and intervenors’ filings with the Commission, that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n110\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following:\n–\nWe inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year.\n–\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission- approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable.\n–\nWe utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances.\n–\nWe compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery.\nDuke Energy Indiana Coal Ash Asset Retirement Obligations – Refer to Notes 1, 4, and 9 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nDuke Energy Indiana has asset retirement obligations associated with coal ash impoundments at operating and retired coal generation facilities. These legal obligations are the result of Indiana state and federal regulations. There is significant judgment in determining the methods to close each site since Duke Energy Indiana does not have approved closure plans for certain sites. Management has applied probability weightings for the cash flows for certain sites based the likelihood of implementing potential closure methods. Probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods (“probability weightings”) creates estimation uncertainty. The liability for coal ash asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana was $949 million at December 31, 2021.\nWe identified the asset retirement obligations associated with coal ash impoundments at Duke Energy Indiana as a critical audit matter because of the significant management estimates and assumptions, including the different potential closure methods and the probability weightings as a result of pending legal challenges. The audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates and assumptions related to the probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our environmental specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the probability weightings for the cash flows associated with the different potential closure methods for coal ash asset retirement obligations at Duke Energy Indiana included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over management’s coal ash asset retirement obligation estimate, including those over management’s determination of the probability weightings.\n•\nWe tested the mathematical accuracy of management’s coal ash asset retirement obligation calculations, including the application of probability weightings.\n•\nWe made inquiries of internal and external legal counsel regarding the status of the legal matters associated with the probability weightings.\n•\nWe inspected the opinions from internal and external legal counsel supporting the probability weightings.\n•\nWith the assistance of professionals in our firm with the appropriate expertise, we inspected the Company’s filings with and orders from the Indiana Department of Environmental Management, for evidence that might contradict management’s assertions regarding the probability weightings.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n111\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n112\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n113\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n114\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA, LLC\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n115\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholder and the Board of Directors of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Piedmont Natural Gas Company, Inc. and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income, changes in equity, and cash flows, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. The Company is not required to have, nor were we engaged to perform, an audit of its internal control over financial reporting. As part of our audits, we are required to obtain an understanding of internal control over financial reporting but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting. Accordingly, we express no such opinion.\nOur audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRegulatory Matters – Impact of Rate Regulation on the Financial Statements – Refer to Notes 1 and 3 to the financial statements.\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company is subject to rate regulation by the North Carolina Utilities Commission, the Public Service Commission of South Carolina, and the Tennessee Public Utility Commission (collectively the “Commissions”), which have jurisdiction with respect to the gas rates of the Company. Management has determined it meets the criteria for the application of regulated operations accounting in preparing its financial statements under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Significant judgment can be required to determine if otherwise recognizable incurred costs qualify to be presented as a regulatory asset and deferred because such costs are probable of future recovery in customer rates. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has approximately $456.8 million recorded as regulatory assets.\nWe identified the impact of rate regulation related to regulatory assets as a critical audit matter due to the significant judgments made by management, including assumptions regarding the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, to support its assertions on the likelihood of future recovery for deferred costs. Given that management’s accounting judgments are based on assumptions about the outcome of future decisions by the Commissions, auditing these judgments required specialized knowledge of accounting for rate regulation and the ratemaking process due to its inherent complexities as it relates to regulatory assets.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the recovery of regulatory assets included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of management’s controls over the evaluation of the likelihood of recovery in future rates and the monitoring and evaluation of regulatory developments that may affect the likelihood of recovering costs in future rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s disclosures related to the impacts of rate regulation, including the balances recorded and regulatory developments.\n•\nWe read relevant regulatory orders issued by the Commission, regulatory statutes, interpretations, procedural memorandums, filings made by intervenors, and other publicly available information to assess the likelihood of recovery in future rates based on precedents of the Commissions’ treatment of similar costs under similar circumstances. We evaluated the external information and compared it to management’s recorded balances for completeness.\n•\nFor regulatory matters in process, we inspected the Company’s and intervenors’ filings with the Commissions, that may impact the Company’s future rates, for any evidence that might contradict management’s assertions.\n116\n•\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of management’s judgments regarding the recoverability of regulatory asset balances by performing the following:\n–\nWe inquired of management regarding changes in regulatory orders and regulatory asset balances during the year.\n–\nWe evaluated the reasonableness of such changes based on our knowledge of commission- approved amortization, expected incurred costs, and recently approved regulatory orders, as applicable.\n–\nWe utilized trend analyses to evaluate the historical consistency of regulatory asset balances.\n–\nWe compared the recorded regulatory asset balance to an independently developed expectation of the corresponding balance.\n•\nWe obtained representation from management asserting that regulatory assets recorded in the financial statements are probable of recovery.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 24, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1951.\n117\nPIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n118\nPIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n119\nPIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n120\nPIEDMONT NATURAL GAS COMPANY, INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n121\nIndex to Combined Notes To Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe notes to the consolidated financial statements are a combined presentation. The following table indicates the registrants to which the notes apply.\nTables within the notes may not sum across due to (i) Progress Energy's consolidation of Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and other subsidiaries that are not registrants and (ii) subsidiaries that are not registrants but included in the consolidated Duke Energy balances.\n1.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nNature of Operations and Basis of Consolidation\nDuke Energy is an energy company headquartered in Charlotte, North Carolina, subject to regulation by the FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below. Duke Energy operates in the U.S. primarily through its direct and indirect subsidiaries. Certain Duke Energy subsidiaries are also subsidiary registrants, including Duke Energy Carolinas; Progress Energy; Duke Energy Progress; Duke Energy Florida; Duke Energy Ohio; Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont. When discussing Duke Energy’s consolidated financial information, it necessarily includes the results of its separate Subsidiary Registrants, which along with Duke Energy, are collectively referred to as the Duke Energy Registrants.\nThe information in these combined notes relates to each of the Duke Energy Registrants as noted in the Index to Combined Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements. However, none of the Subsidiary Registrants make any representation as to information related solely to Duke Energy or the Subsidiary Registrants of Duke Energy other than itself.\nThese Consolidated Financial Statements include, after eliminating intercompany transactions and balances, the accounts of the Duke Energy Registrants and subsidiaries or VIEs where the respective Duke Energy Registrants have control. See Note 17 for additional information on VIEs. These Consolidated Financial Statements also reflect the Duke Energy Registrants’ proportionate share of certain jointly owned generation and transmission facilities. See Note 8 for additional information on joint ownership. Substantially all of the Subsidiary Registrants' operations qualify for regulatory accounting.\nDuke Energy Carolinas is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Duke Energy Carolinas is subject to the regulatory provisions of the NCUC, PSCSC, NRC and FERC.\nProgress Energy is a public utility holding company, which conducts operations through its wholly owned subsidiaries, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida. Progress Energy is subject to regulation by FERC and other regulatory agencies listed below.\nDuke Energy Progress is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of North Carolina and South Carolina. Duke Energy Progress is subject to the regulatory provisions of the NCUC, PSCSC, NRC and FERC.\nDuke Energy Florida is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of Florida. Duke Energy Florida is subject to the regulatory provisions of the FPSC, NRC and FERC.\nDuke Energy Ohio is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the transmission and distribution of electricity in portions of Ohio and Kentucky, the generation and sale of electricity in portions of Kentucky and the transportation and sale of natural gas in portions of Ohio and Kentucky. Duke Energy Ohio conducts competitive auctions for retail electricity supply in Ohio whereby the energy price is recovered from retail customers and recorded in Operating Revenues on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. Operations in Kentucky are conducted through its wholly owned subsidiary, Duke Energy Kentucky. References herein to Duke Energy Ohio collectively include Duke Energy Ohio and its subsidiaries, unless otherwise noted. Duke Energy Ohio is subject to the regulatory provisions of the PUCO, KPSC and FERC.\nDuke Energy Indiana is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity in portions of Indiana. Duke Energy Indiana is subject to the regulatory provisions of the IURC and FERC.\nPiedmont is a regulated public utility primarily engaged in the distribution of natural gas in portions of North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Piedmont is subject to the regulatory provisions of the NCUC, PSCSC, TPUC and FERC.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\n122\nOther Current Assets and Liabilities\nThe following table provides a description of amounts included in Other within Current Assets or Current Liabilities that exceed 5% of total Current Assets or Current Liabilities on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets at either December 31, 2021, or 2020.\nDiscontinued Operations\nDuke Energy has elected to present cash flows of discontinued operations combined with cash flows of continuing operations. Unless otherwise noted, the notes to these consolidated financial statements exclude amounts related to discontinued operations for all periods presented. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Income (Loss) From Discontinued Operations, net of tax on Duke Energy's Consolidated Statements of Operations is entirely attributable to controlling interest.\nNoncontrolling Interest\nDuke Energy maintains a controlling financial interest in certain less than wholly owned nonregulated subsidiaries. As a result, Duke Energy consolidates these subsidiaries and presents the third-party investors' portion of Duke Energy's net income (loss), net assets and comprehensive income (loss) as noncontrolling interest. Noncontrolling interest is included as a component of equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nSeveral operating agreements of Duke Energy's subsidiaries with noncontrolling interest are subject to allocations of tax attributes and cash flows in accordance with contractual agreements that vary throughout the lives of the subsidiaries. Therefore, Duke Energy and the other investors' (the owners) interests in the subsidiaries are not fixed, and the subsidiaries apply the HLBV method in allocating income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss (all measured on a pretax basis) to the owners. The HLBV method measures the amounts that each owner would hypothetically claim at each balance sheet reporting date, including tax benefits realized by the owners, most of which is over the IRS recapture period, upon a hypothetical liquidation of the subsidiary at the net book value of its underlying assets. The change in the amount that each owner would hypothetically receive at the reporting date compared to the amount it would have received on the previous reporting date represents the amount of income or loss allocated to each owner for the reporting period.\nOther operating agreements of Duke Energy's subsidiaries with noncontrolling interest allocate profit and loss based on their pro rata shares of the ownership interest in the respective subsidiary. Therefore, Duke Energy allocates net income or loss and other comprehensive income or loss of these subsidiaries to the owners based on their pro rata shares.\nIn 2019, Duke Energy completed a sale of minority interest in a portion of certain renewable assets within the Commercial Renewables Segment for pretax proceeds to Duke Energy of $\n415\nmillion. The portion of Duke Energy's commercial renewables energy portfolio sold includes\n49\n% of\n37\noperating wind, solar and battery storage assets and\n33\n% of\n11\noperating solar assets across the U.S. Duke Energy retained control of these assets, and, therefore, no gain or loss was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the consideration received and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest claim on net assets was $\n466\nmillion, net of tax benefit of $\n8\nmillion, and was recorded to equity.\nThe following table presents allocated losses to noncontrolling interest for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n123\n2021 Sale of Minority Interest in Duke Energy Indiana\nOn January 28, 2021, Duke Energy executed an agreement providing for an investment by an affiliate of GIC in Duke Energy Indiana in exchange for a\n19.9\n% minority interest issued by Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC, the holding company for Duke Energy Indiana. The transaction will be completed following\ntwo\nclosings for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $\n2\nbillion. The first closing, which occurred on September 8, 2021, resulted in Duke Energy Indiana Holdco, LLC issuing\n11.05\n% of its membership interests in exchange for approximately $\n1,025\nmillion or\n50\n% of the purchase price. Duke Energy retained indirect control of these assets, and, therefore, no gain or loss was recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The difference between the cash consideration received, net of transaction costs of approximately $\n27\nmillion, and the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest is $\n545\nmillion and was recorded as an increase to equity. Under the terms of the agreement, Duke Energy has the discretion to determine the timing of the second closing, but it will occur no later than January 2023. At the second closing, Duke Energy will issue and sell additional membership interests such that GIC will own\n19.9\n% of the membership interests for the remaining\n50\n% of the purchase price.\nAcquisitions\nThe Duke Energy Registrants consolidate assets and liabilities from acquisitions as of the purchase date and include earnings from acquisitions in consolidated earnings after the purchase date.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing financial statements that conform to GAAP, the Duke Energy Registrants must make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRegulatory Accounting\nThe majority of the Duke Energy Registrants’ operations are subject to price regulation for the sale of electricity and natural gas by state utility commissions or FERC. When prices are set on the basis of specific costs of the regulated operations and an effective franchise is in place such that sufficient natural gas or electric services can be sold to recover those costs, the Duke Energy Registrants apply regulatory accounting. Regulatory accounting changes the timing of the recognition of costs or revenues relative to a company that does not apply regulatory accounting. As a result, regulatory assets and regulatory liabilities are recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related cost in the ratemaking process. Regulatory assets are reviewed for recoverability each reporting period. If a regulatory asset is no longer deemed probable of recovery, the deferred cost is charged to earnings. See Note 3 for further information.\nRegulatory accounting rules also require recognition of a disallowance (also called \"impairment\") loss if it becomes probable that part of the cost of a plant under construction (or a recently completed plant or an abandoned plant) will be disallowed for ratemaking purposes and a reasonable estimate of the amount of the disallowance can be made. For example, if a cost cap is set for a plant still under construction, the amount of the disallowance is a result of a judgment as to the ultimate cost of the plant. These disallowances can require judgments on allowed future rate recovery.\nWhen it becomes probable that regulated generation, transmission or distribution assets will be abandoned, the cost of the asset is removed from plant in service. The value that may be retained as a regulatory asset on the balance sheet for the abandoned property is dependent upon amounts that may be recovered through regulated rates, including any return. As such, an impairment charge could be partially or fully offset by the establishment of a regulatory asset if rate recovery is probable. The impairment charge for a disallowance of costs for regulated plants under construction, recently completed or abandoned is based on discounted cash flows.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants utilize cost-tracking mechanisms, commonly referred to as fuel adjustment clauses or PGA clauses. These clauses allow for the recovery of fuel and fuel-related costs, portions of purchased power, natural gas costs and hedging costs through surcharges on customer rates. The difference between the costs incurred and the surcharge revenues is recorded either as an adjustment to Operating Revenues, Operating Expenses – Fuel used in electric generation or Operating Expenses – Cost of natural gas on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, with an off-setting impact on regulatory assets or liabilities\n.\n124\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Restricted Cash\nAll highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the date of acquisition are considered cash equivalents. Duke Energy, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Florida have restricted cash balances related primarily to collateral assets, escrow deposits and VIEs. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have restricted cash balances related to VIEs from storm recovery bonds issued in 2021. See Note 17 for additional information. Restricted cash amounts are included in Other within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the components of cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInventory\nInventory related to regulated operations is valued at historical cost. Inventory related to nonregulated operations is valued at the lower of cost or market. Inventory is charged to expense or capitalized to property, plant and equipment when issued, primarily using the average cost method. Excess or obsolete inventory is written down to the lower of cost or net realizable value. Once inventory has been written down, it creates a new cost basis for the inventory that is not subsequently written up. Provisions for inventory write-offs were not material at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe components of inventory are presented in the tables below.\n125\nInvestments in Debt and Equity Securities\nThe Duke Energy Registrants classify investments in equity securities as FV-NI and investments in debt securities as AFS. Both categories are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Realized and unrealized gains and losses on securities classified as FV-NI are reported through net income. Unrealized gains and losses for debt securities classified as AFS are included in AOCI until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment has a credit loss. For certain investments of regulated operations, such as substantially all of the NDTF, realized and unrealized gains and losses (including any credit losses) on debt securities are recorded as a regulatory asset or liability. The credit loss portion of debt securities of nonregulated operations are included in earnings. Investments in debt and equity securities are classified as either current or noncurrent based on management’s intent and ability to sell these securities, taking into consideration current market liquidity.\nSee Note 15 for further information.\nGoodwill\nDuke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont perform annual goodwill impairment tests as of August 31 each year at the reporting unit level, which is determined to be a business segment or one level below. Duke Energy, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Ohio and Piedmont update these tests between annual tests if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value. See Note 11 for further information.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets are included in Other in Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Generally, intangible assets are amortized using an amortization method that reflects the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset are consumed or on a straight-line basis if that pattern is not readily determinable. Amortization of intangibles is reflected in Depreciation and amortization on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Intangible assets are subject to impairment testing and if impaired, the carrying value is accordingly reduced.\nRECs are used to measure compliance with renewable energy standards and are held primarily for consumption.\nSee Note 11 for further information.\nLong-Lived Asset Impairments\nThe Duke Energy Registrants evaluate long-lived assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable. An impairment exists when a long-lived asset’s carrying value exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. If the carrying value of the long-lived asset is not recoverable based on these estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the carrying value of the asset is written down to its then current estimated fair value and an impairment charge is recognized.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants assess fair value of long-lived assets using various methods, including recent comparable third-party sales, internally developed discounted cash flow analysis and analysis from outside advisors. Triggering events to reassess cash flows may include, but are not limited to, significant changes in commodity prices, the condition of an asset or management’s interest in selling the asset.\nEquity Method Investment Impairments\nInvestments in affiliates that are not controlled by Duke Energy, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method. Equity method investments are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the investment may not be recoverable. If the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary, the investment is written down to its estimated fair value, which establishes a new cost basis in the investment.\nImpairment assessments use a discounted cash flow income approach and include consideration of the severity and duration of any decline in the fair value of the investments. The estimated cash flows may be based on alternative expected outcomes that are probability weighted. Key inputs that involve estimates and significant management judgment include cash flow projections, selection of a discount rate, probability weighting of potential outcomes, and whether any decline in value is considered temporary.\n126\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at the lower of depreciated historical cost net of any disallowances or fair value, if impaired. The Duke Energy Registrants capitalize all construction-related direct labor and material costs, as well as indirect construction costs such as general engineering, taxes and financing costs. See “Allowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized” section below for information on capitalized financing costs. Costs of renewals and betterments that extend the useful life of property, plant and equipment are also capitalized. The cost of repairs, replacements and major maintenance projects, which do not extend the useful life or increase the expected output of the asset, are expensed as incurred. Depreciation is generally computed over the estimated useful life of the asset using the composite straight-line method. Depreciation studies are conducted periodically to update composite rates and are approved by state utility commissions and/or the FERC when required.\nThe composite weighted average depreciation rates, excluding nuclear fuel, are included in the table that follows.\nIn general, when the Duke Energy Registrants retire regulated property, plant and equipment, the original cost plus the cost of retirement, less salvage value and any depreciation already recognized, is charged to accumulated depreciation. However, when it becomes probable the asset will be retired substantially in advance of its original expected useful life or is abandoned, the cost of the asset and the corresponding accumulated depreciation is recognized as a separate asset. If the asset is still in operation, the net amount is classified as Facilities to be retired, net on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. If the asset is no longer operating, the net amount is classified in Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets if deemed recoverable (see discussion of long-lived asset impairments above). The carrying value of the asset is based on historical cost if the Duke Energy Registrants are allowed to recover the remaining net book value and a return equal to at least the incremental borrowing rate. If not, an impairment is recognized to the extent the net book value of the asset exceeds the present value of future revenues discounted at the incremental borrowing rate.\nWhen the Duke Energy Registrants sell entire regulated operating units, or retire or sell nonregulated properties, the original cost and accumulated depreciation and amortization balances are removed from Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any gain or loss is recorded in earnings, unless otherwise required by the applicable regulatory body. See Note 10 for additional information.\nLeases\nDuke Energy determines if an arrangement is a lease at contract inception based on whether the arrangement involves the use of a physically distinct identified asset and whether Duke Energy has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset throughout the period as well as the right to direct the use of the asset. As a policy election, Duke Energy does not evaluate arrangements with initial contract terms of less than one year as leases.\nOperating leases are included in Operating lease ROU assets, net, Other current liabilities and Operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Finance leases are included in Property, plant and equipment, Current maturities of long-term debt and Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nFor lessee and lessor arrangements, Duke Energy has elected a policy to not separate lease and non-lease components for all asset classes. For lessor arrangements, lease and non-lease components are only combined under one arrangement and accounted for under the lease accounting framework if the non-lease components are not the predominant component of the arrangement and the lease component would be classified as an operating lease.\nNuclear Fuel\nNuclear fuel is classified as Property, Plant and Equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNuclear fuel in the front-end fuel processing phase is considered work in progress and not amortized until placed in service. Amortization of nuclear fuel is included within Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amortization is recorded using the units-of-production method.\nAllowance for Funds Used During Construction and Interest Capitalized\nFor regulated operations, the debt and equity costs of financing the construction of property, plant and equipment are reflected as AFUDC and capitalized as a component of the cost of property, plant and equipment. AFUDC equity is reported on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as non-cash income in Other income and expenses, net. AFUDC debt is reported as a non-cash offset to Interest Expense. After construction is completed, the Duke Energy Registrants are permitted to recover these costs through their inclusion in rate base and the corresponding subsequent depreciation or amortization of those regulated assets.\nAFUDC equity, a permanent difference for income taxes, reduces the ETR when capitalized and increases the ETR when depreciated or amortized. See Note 23 for additional information.\n127\nFor nonregulated operations, interest is capitalized during the construction phase with an offsetting non-cash credit to Interest Expense on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nAROs are recognized for legal obligations associated with the retirement of property, plant and equipment. Substantially all AROs are related to regulated operations. When recording an ARO, the present value of the projected liability is recognized in the period in which it is incurred, if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. The liability is accreted over time. For operating plants, the present value of the liability is added to the cost of the associated asset and depreciated over the remaining life of the asset. For retired plants, the present value of the liability is recorded as a regulatory asset unless determined not to be probable of recovery.\nThe present value of the initial obligation and subsequent updates are based on discounted cash flows, which include estimates regarding timing of future cash flows, selection of discount rates and cost escalation rates, among other factors. These estimates are subject to change. Depreciation expense is adjusted prospectively for any changes to the carrying amount of the associated asset. The Duke Energy Registrants receive amounts to fund the cost of the ARO for regulated operations through a combination of regulated revenues and earnings on the NDTF. As a result, amounts recovered in regulated revenues, earnings on the NDTF, accretion expense and depreciation of the associated asset are netted and deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\nAccounts Payable\nDuring 2020, Duke Energy established a supply chain finance program (the “program”) with a global financial institution. The program is voluntary and allows Duke Energy suppliers, at their sole discretion, to sell their receivables from Duke Energy to the financial institution at a rate that leverages Duke Energy’s credit rating and, which may result in favorable terms compared to the rate available to the supplier on their own credit rating. Suppliers participating in the program, determine at their sole discretion which invoices they will sell to the financial institution. Suppliers’ decisions on which invoices are sold do not impact Duke Energy’s payment terms, which are based on commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and the supplier regardless of program participation. The commercial terms negotiated between Duke Energy and its suppliers are consistent regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the program. Duke Energy does not issue any guarantees with respect to the program and does not participate in negotiations between suppliers and the financial institution. Duke Energy does not have an economic interest in the supplier’s decision to participate in the program and receives no interest, fees or other benefit from the financial institution based on supplier participation in the program.\nThe following table presents the outstanding accounts payable balance sold to the financial institution by our suppliers and the supplier invoices sold to the financial institution under the program included within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020.\nRevenue Recognition\nDuke Energy recognizes revenue as customers obtain control of promised goods and services in an amount that reflects consideration expected in exchange for those goods or services. Generally, the delivery of electricity and natural gas results in the transfer of control to customers at the time the commodity is delivered and the amount of revenue recognized is equal to the amount billed to each customer, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred. See Note 18 for further information.\nDerivatives and Hedging\nDerivative and non-derivative instruments may be used in connection with commodity price and interest rate activities, including swaps, futures, forwards and options. All derivative instruments, except those that qualify for the NPNS exception, are recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. Qualifying derivative instruments may be designated as either cash flow hedges or fair value hedges. Other derivative instruments (undesignated contracts) either have not been designated or do not qualify as hedges. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of cash flow hedges is recorded in AOCI. The effective portion of the change in the fair value of a fair value hedge is offset in net income by changes in the hedged item. For activity subject to regulatory accounting, gains and losses on derivative contracts are reflected as regulatory assets or liabilities and not as other comprehensive income or current period income. As a result, changes in fair value of these derivatives have no immediate earnings impact.\nFormal documentation, including transaction type and risk management strategy, is maintained for all contracts accounted for as a hedge. At inception and at least every three months thereafter, the hedge contract is assessed to see if it is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items.\nSee Note 14 for further information.\nCaptive Insurance Reserves\nDuke Energy has captive insurance subsidiaries that provide coverage, on an indemnity basis, to the Subsidiary Registrants as well as certain third parties, on a limited basis, for financial losses, primarily related to property, workers’ compensation and general liability. Liabilities include provisions for estimated losses incurred but not reported (IBNR), as well as estimated provisions for known claims. IBNR reserve estimates are primarily based upon historical loss experience, industry data and other actuarial assumptions. Reserve estimates are adjusted in future periods as actual losses differ from experience.\n128\nDuke Energy, through its captive insurance entities, also has reinsurance coverage with third parties for certain losses above a per occurrence and/or aggregate retention. Receivables for reinsurance coverage are recognized when realization is deemed probable.\nUnamortized Debt Premium, Discount and Expense\nPremiums, discounts and expenses incurred with the issuance of outstanding long-term debt are amortized over the term of the debt issue. The gain or loss on extinguishment associated with refinancing higher-cost debt obligations in the regulated operations is amortized over the remaining life of the original instrument. Amortization expense is recorded as Interest Expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and is reflected as Depreciation, amortization and accretion within Net cash provided by operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nPremiums, discounts and expenses are presented as an adjustment to the carrying value of the debt amount and included in Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets presented.\nPreferred Stock\nPreferred stock is reviewed to determine the appropriate balance sheet classification and embedded features, such as call options, are evaluated to determine if they should be bifurcated and accounted for separately. Costs directly related to the issuance of preferred stock are recorded as a reduction of the proceeds received. The liability for the dividend is recognized when declared. The accumulated dividends on the cumulative preferred stock is recognized to net income available to Duke Energy Corporation in the EPS calculation. See Note 19 for further information.\nLoss Contingencies and Environmental Liabilities\nContingent losses are recorded when it is probable a loss has occurred and the loss can be reasonably estimated. When a range of the probable loss exists and no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount, the minimum amount in the range is recorded. Unless otherwise required by GAAP, legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nEnvironmental liabilities are recorded on an undiscounted basis when environmental remediation or other liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated. Environmental expenditures related to past operations that do not generate current or future revenues are expensed. Environmental expenditures related to operations that generate current or future revenues are expensed or capitalized, as appropriate. Certain environmental expenditures receive regulatory accounting treatment and are recorded as regulatory assets.\nSee Notes 3 and 4 for further information.\nPension and Other Post-Retirement Benefit Plans\nDuke Energy maintains qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans. Eligible employees of the Subsidiary Registrants participate in the respective qualified, non-qualified and other post-retirement benefit plans and the Subsidiary Registrants are allocated their proportionate share of benefit costs.\nSee Note 22 for further information, including significant accounting policies associated with these plans.\nSeverance and Special Termination Benefits\nDuke Energy has severance plans under which in general, the longer a terminated employee worked prior to termination the greater the amount of severance benefits. A liability for involuntary severance is recorded once an involuntary severance plan is committed to by management if involuntary severances are probable and can be reasonably estimated. For involuntary severance benefits incremental to its ongoing severance plan benefits, the fair value of the obligation is expensed at the communication date if there are no future service requirements or over the required future service period. Duke Energy also offers special termination benefits under voluntary severance programs. Special termination benefits are recorded immediately upon employee acceptance absent a significant retention period. Otherwise, the cost is recorded over the remaining service period. Employee acceptance of voluntary severance benefits is determined by management based on the facts and circumstances of the benefits being offered.\nSee Note 20 for further information.\nGuarantees\nIf necessary, liabilities are recognized at the time of issuance or material modification of a guarantee for the estimated fair value of the obligation it assumes. Fair value is estimated using a probability weighted approach. The obligation is reduced over the term of the guarantee or related contract in a systematic and rational method as risk is reduced. Duke Energy recognizes a liability for the best estimate of its loss due to the nonperformance of the guaranteed party. This liability is recognized at the inception of a guarantee and is updated periodically.\nSee Note 7 for further information.\nStock-Based Compensation\nStock-based compensation represents costs related to stock-based awards granted to employees and Board of Directors members. Duke Energy recognizes stock-based compensation based upon the estimated fair value of awards, net of estimated forfeitures at the date of issuance. The recognition period for these costs begins at either the applicable service inception date or grant date and continues throughout the requisite service period. Compensation cost is recognized as expense or capitalized as a component of property, plant and equipment.\nSee Note 21 for further information.\nIncome Taxes\nDuke Energy and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and foreign jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants are parties to a tax-sharing agreement with Duke Energy. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations. Deferred income taxes have been provided for temporary differences between GAAP and tax bases of assets and liabilities because the differences create taxable or tax-deductible amounts for future periods. ITCs associated with regulated operations are deferred and amortized as a reduction of income tax expense over the estimated useful lives of the related properties. For ITCs associated with nonregulated operations see “Accounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits.”\n129\nAccumulated deferred income taxes are valued using the enacted tax rate expected to apply to taxable income in the periods in which the deferred tax asset or liability is expected to be settled or realized. In the event of a change in tax rates, deferred tax assets and liabilities are remeasured as of the enactment date of the new rate. To the extent that the change in the value of the deferred tax represents an obligation to customers, the impact of the remeasurement is deferred to a regulatory liability. Remaining impacts are recorded in income from continuing operations. Duke Energy's results of operations could be impacted if the estimate of the tax effect of reversing temporary differences is not reflective of actual outcomes, is modified to reflect new developments or interpretations of the tax law, revised to incorporate new accounting principles, or changes in the expected timing or manner of a reversal.\nTax-related interest and penalties are recorded in Interest Expense and Other Income and Expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSee Note 23 for further information.\nAccounting for Renewable Energy Tax Credits\nWhen Duke Energy receives ITCs on wind or solar facilities associated with its nonregulated operations, it reduces the basis of the property recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets by the amount of the ITC and, therefore, the ITC benefit is ultimately recognized in the statement of operations through reduced depreciation expense. Additionally, certain tax credits and government grants result in an initial tax depreciable base in excess of the book carrying value by an amount equal to one half of the ITC. Deferred tax benefits are recorded as a reduction to income tax expense in the period that the basis difference is created.\nDuke Energy receives PTCs on wind facilities that are recognized as electricity is produced and records related amounts as a reduction of income tax expense.\nExcise Taxes\nCertain excise taxes levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis. Taxes for which Duke Energy operates merely as a collection agent for the state and local government are accounted for on a net basis.\nExcise taxes accounted for on a gross basis within both Operating Revenues and Property and other taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations were as follows.\nDividend Restrictions and Unappropriated Retained Earnings\nDuke Energy does not have any current legal, regulatory or other restrictions on paying common stock dividends to shareholders. However, if Duke Energy were to defer dividend payments on the preferred stock, the declaration of common stock dividends would be prohibited. See Note 19 for more information. Additionally, as further described in Note 3, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont have restrictions on paying dividends or otherwise advancing funds to Duke Energy due to conditions established by regulators in conjunction with merger transaction approvals. At December 31, 2021, and 2020, an insignificant amount of Duke Energy’s consolidated Retained earnings balance represents undistributed earnings of equity method investments.\nNew Accounting Standards\nThe following new accounting standard was adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants in 2021.\nLeases with Variable Lease Payments.\nIn July 2021, the FASB issued new accounting guidance requiring lessors to classify a lease with variable lease payments that do not depend on a reference index or rate as an operating lease if both of the following are met: (1) the lease would have to be classified as a sales-type or direct financing lease under prior guidance, and (2) the lessor would have recognized a day-one loss. Duke Energy elected to adopt the guidance immediately upon issuance of the new standard and will be applying the new standard prospectively to new lease arrangements meeting the criteria. Duke Energy did not have any lease arrangements that this new accounting guidance materially impacted.\nThe following new accounting standard was adopted by Duke Energy Registrants in 2020.\nCurrent Expected Credit Losses.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for credit losses. Duke Energy adopted the new accounting guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year results. Duke Energy did not adopt any practical expedients.\nDuke Energy recognizes allowances for credit losses based on management's estimate of losses expected to be incurred over the lives of certain assets or guarantees. Management monitors credit quality, changes in expected credit losses and the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a forward-looking basis. Management reviews the risk of loss periodically as part of the existing assessment of collectability of receivables.\n130\nDuke Energy reviews the credit quality of its counterparties as part of its regular risk management process and requires credit enhancements, such as deposits or letters of credit, as appropriate and as allowed by regulators.\nDuke Energy recorded cumulative effects of changes in accounting principles related to the adoption of the new credit loss standard for allowances and credit losses of trade and other receivables, insurance receivables and financial guarantees. These amounts are included in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Receivables, Receivables of VIEs, Other Noncurrent Assets and Other Noncurrent Liabilities.\nSee Notes 7 and 18 for more information.\nDuke Energy recorded an adjustment for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle due to the adoption of this standard on January 1, 2020, as shown in the table below:\nThe following new accounting standard has been issued but not yet adopted by the Duke Energy Registrants as of December 31, 2021.\nReference Rate Reform.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued new accounting guidance for reference rate reform. This guidance is elective and provides expedients to facilitate financial reporting for the anticipated transition away from the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank reference rates starting in 2021 with all rates expected to be fully phased out in 2023. The optional expedients are effective for modification of existing contracts or new arrangements executed between March 12, 2020, through December 31, 2022.\nDuke Energy has variable-rate debt and manages interest rate risk by entering into financial contracts including interest rate swaps that are generally indexed to LIBOR. Impacted financial arrangements extending beyond the phase out of the applicable LIBOR rate may require contractual amendment or termination to fully adapt to a post-LIBOR environment. Duke Energy is assessing these financial arrangements and is evaluating the use of optional expedients outlined in the new accounting guidance. Alternative index provisions are also being assessed and incorporated into new financial arrangements that extend beyond the phase out of the applicable LIBOR rate. The full outcome of the transition away from LIBOR cannot be determined at this time, but is not expected to have a material impact on the financial statements.\n2.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nReportable segments are determined based on information used by the chief operating decision-maker in deciding how to allocate resources and evaluate the performance of the business. Duke Energy evaluates segment performance based on segment income. Segment income is defined as income from continuing operations net of income attributable to noncontrolling interests and preferred stock dividends. Segment income, as discussed below, includes intercompany revenues and expenses that are eliminated on the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain governance costs are allocated to each segment. In addition, direct interest expense and income taxes are included in segment income.\nProducts and services are sold between affiliate companies and reportable segments of Duke Energy at cost. Segment assets as presented in the tables that follow exclude all intercompany assets.\nDuke Energy\nDuke Energy's segment structure includes the following segments: Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables.\nThe Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment includes Duke Energy's regulated electric utilities in the Carolinas, Florida and the Midwest. The regulated electric utilities conduct operations through the Subsidiary Registrants that are substantially all regulated and, accordingly, qualify for regulatory accounting treatment. Electric Utilities and Infrastructure also includes Duke Energy's electric transmission infrastructure investments.\nThe Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment includes Piedmont, Duke Energy's natural gas local distribution companies in Ohio and Kentucky, and Duke Energy's natural gas storage and midstream pipeline investments. Gas Utilities and Infrastructure's operations are substantially all regulated and, accordingly, qualify for regulatory accounting treatment.\nThe Commercial Renewables segment is primarily comprised of nonregulated utility-scale wind and solar generation assets located throughout the U.S.\nThe remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other, which is primarily comprised of interest expense on holding company debt, unallocated corporate costs and Duke Energy’s wholly owned captive insurance company, Bison. Other also includes Duke Energy's interest in NMC. See Note 12 for additional information on the investment in NMC.\n131\nBusiness segment information is presented in the following tables.

The remainder of Duke Energy Ohio's operations is presented as Other.\nAll Duke Energy Ohio assets and revenues from continuing operations are within the U.S.\n134\n3.\nREGULATORY MATTERS\nREGULATORY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe Duke Energy Registrants record regulatory assets and liabilities that result from the ratemaking process. See Note 1 for further information.\n135\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy and Progress Energy. See separate tables below for balances by individual registrant.\nDescriptions of regulatory assets and liabilities summarized in the tables above and below follow. See tables below for recovery and amortization periods at the separate registrants.\nAROs\n–\ncoal ash.\nRepresents deferred depreciation and accretion related to the legal obligation to close ash basins. The costs are deferred until recovery treatment has been determined. See Notes 1 and 9 for additional information.\n136\nAROs\n–\nnuclear and other.\nRepresents regulatory assets or liabilities, including deferred depreciation and accretion, related to legal obligations associated with the future retirement of property, plant and equipment, excluding amounts related to coal ash. The AROs relate primarily to decommissioning nuclear power facilities. The amounts also include certain deferred gains and losses on NDTF investments. See Notes 1 and 9 for additional information.\nAccrued pension and OPEB.\nAccrued pension and OPEB represent regulatory assets and liabilities related to each of the Duke Energy Registrants’ respective shares of unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized prior service cost and credit attributable to Duke Energy’s pension plans and OPEB plans. The regulatory asset or liability is amortized with the recognition of actuarial gains and losses and prior service cost and credit to net periodic benefit costs for pension and OPEB plans. The accrued pension and OPEB regulatory assets are expected to be recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\nDeferred fuel and purchased power.\nRepresents certain energy-related costs that are recoverable or refundable as approved by the applicable regulatory body.\nStorm cost securitized balance, net.\nRepresents the North Carolina portion of storm restoration expenditures related to Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Dorian and Winter Storm Diego (2018 and 2019 events).\nNuclear asset securitized balance, net.\nRepresents the balance associated with Crystal River Unit 3 retirement approved for recovery by the FPSC on September 15, 2015, and the upfront financing costs securitized in 2016 with issuance of the associated bonds.

Certain subsidiaries may transfer funds to the Parent by obtaining approval of the respective state regulatory commissions. These conditions imposed restrictions on the ability of the public utility subsidiaries to pay cash dividends as discussed below.\nDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida also have restrictions imposed by their first mortgage bond indentures, which in certain circumstances, limit their ability to make cash dividends or distributions on common stock. Amounts restricted as a result of these provisions were not material at December 31, 2021.\nDuke Energy Indiana has certain dividend restrictions as a result of the minority interest investment agreement entered in January 2021 with GIC. Duke Energy Indiana will declare dividends before the second closing, which is required to be completed no later than January 2023, in accordance with the agreement. See additional information in Note 1.\nAdditionally, certain other subsidiaries of Duke Energy have restrictions on their ability to dividend, loan or advance funds to Duke Energy due to specific legal or regulatory restrictions, including, but not limited to, minimum working capital and tangible net worth requirements.\nThe restrictions discussed below were not a material amount of Duke Energy's and Progress Energy's net assets at December 31, 2021.\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nDuke Energy Carolinas must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to mergers to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.\nDuke Energy Progress\nDuke Energy Progress must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the mergers between Duke Energy and Progress Energy and Duke Energy and Piedmont to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the respective mergers, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.\nDuke Energy Ohio\nDuke Energy Ohio will not declare and pay dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without the prior authorization of the PUCO. Duke Energy Ohio received FERC and PUCO approval to pay dividends from its equity accounts that are reflective of the amount that it would have in its retained earnings account had push-down accounting for the Cinergy merger not been applied to Duke Energy Ohio’s balance sheet. The conditions include a commitment from Duke Energy Ohio that equity, adjusted to remove the impacts of push-down accounting, will not fall below\n30\n% of total capital.\nDuke Energy Kentucky is required to pay dividends solely out of retained earnings and to maintain a minimum of\n35\n% equity in its capital structure.\nDuke Energy Indiana\nDuke Energy Indiana must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the merger between Duke Energy and Cinergy to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded. In addition, Duke Energy Indiana will not declare and pay dividends out of capital or unearned surplus without prior authorization of the IURC.\nPiedmont\nPiedmont must limit cumulative distributions subsequent to the acquisition of Piedmont by Duke Energy to (i) the amount of retained earnings on the day prior to the closing of the merger, plus (ii) any future earnings recorded.\nRATE-RELATED INFORMATION\nThe NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC, IURC, PUCO, TPUC and KPSC approve rates for retail electric and natural gas services within their states. The FERC approves rates for electric sales to wholesale customers served under cost-based rates (excluding Ohio and Indiana), as well as sales of transmission service. The FERC also regulates certification and siting of new interstate natural gas pipeline projects.\n138\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress\n2021 Coal Ash Settlement\nOn January 22\n,\n2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the Coal Combustion Residuals Settlement Agreement (the “CCR Settlement Agreement”) with the North Carolina Public Staff (Public Staff), the North Carolina Attorney General’s Office and the Sierra Club (collectively, the \"Settling Parties\"), which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021. The CCR Settlement Agreement resolves all coal ash prudence and cost recovery issues in connection with 2019 rate cases filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress with the NCUC, as well as the equitable sharing issue on remand from the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases as a result of the December 11, 2020 North Carolina Supreme Court opinion. The settlement also provides clarity on coal ash cost recovery in North Carolina for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress through January 2030 and February 2030 (the \"Term\"), respectively.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress agreed not to seek recovery of approximately $\n1\nbillion of systemwide deferred coal ash expenditures, but will retain the ability to earn a debt and equity return during the amortization period, which shall be\nfive years\nunder the 2019 North Carolina rate cases and will be set by the NCUC in future rate case proceedings. The equity return and the amortization period on deferred coal ash costs under the 2017 Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress North Carolina rate cases will remain unaffected. The equity return on deferred coal ash costs under the 2019 North Carolina rate cases and future rate cases in North Carolina will be set at\n150\nbasis points lower than the authorized return on equity (ROE) then in effect, with a capital structure composed of\n48\n% debt and\n52\n% equity. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress retain the ability to earn a full WACC return during the deferral period, which is the period from when costs are incurred until they are recovered in rates.\nThe Settling Parties agreed that execution by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress of a settlement agreement between themselves and the NCDEQ dated December 31, 2019, (the “DEQ Settlement”) and the coal ash management plans included therein or subsequently approved by DEQ are reasonable and prudent. The Settling Parties retain the right to challenge the reasonableness and prudence of actions taken by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and costs incurred to implement the scope of work agreed upon in the DEQ Settlement, after February 1, 2020, and March 1, 2020, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. The Settling Parties further agreed to waive rights through the Term to challenge the reasonableness or prudence of Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke Energy Progress’ historical coal ash management practices, and to waive the right to assert any arguments that future coal ash costs, including financing costs, shall be shared between either company and customers through equitable sharing or any other rate base or return adjustment that shares the revenue requirement burden of coal ash costs not otherwise disallowed due to imprudence.\nThe Settling Parties agreed to a sharing arrangement for future coal ash insurance litigation proceeds between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress and North Carolina customers. For more information, see Note 4 \"Commitments and Contingencies.\"\nAs a result of the CCR Settlement Agreement, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress recorded a pretax charge of approximately $\n454\nmillion and $\n494\nmillion, respectively, in the fourth quarter of 2020 to Impairment of assets and other charges and a reversal of approximately $\n50\nmillion and $\n102\nmillion, respectively, to Regulated electric operating revenues on the respective Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Coal Ash Settlement was approved without modification in the NCUC Orders in the 2019 rate cases on March 31, 2021, and April 16, 2021, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. The NCUC issued an Order on Remand Accepting CCR Settlement and Affirming Previous Orders Settling Rates and Imposing Penalties in the 2017 rate cases on June 25, 2021.\nCarbon Plan\nThe NCUC is required by North Carolina House Bill 951 (HB 951) to adopt an initial Carbon Plan on or before December 31, 2022. The NCUC has directed Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress to file a proposed Carbon Plan on or before May 16, 2022. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nPerformance-Based Regulation Rules\nOn February 10, 2022, the NCUC adopted rules to govern the application and review process for the Performance-Based Regulation (PBR) authorized under HB 951. The PBR rules are constructive and consistent with the policy objectives of HB 951.\n2020 North Carolina Storm Securitization Filings\nOn October 26, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition with the NCUC, as agreed to in partial settlements reached in the 2019 North Carolina Rate Cases for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, seeking authorization for the financing of the costs of each utility's storm recovery activities required as a result of Hurricane Florence, Hurricane Michael, Hurricane Dorian and Winter Storm Diego. Specifically, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress requested that the NCUC find that their storm recovery costs and related financing costs are appropriately financed by debt secured by storm recovery property, and that the commission issue financing orders by which each utility may accomplish such financing using a securitization structure. On January 27, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain accounting issues, including agreement to support an 18- to 20-year bond period. In the NCUC Orders in the 2019 rate cases issued on March 31, 2021, and April 16, 2021, for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively, the reasonableness and prudence of the deferred storm costs was approved. On May 20, 2021, the NCUC issued financing orders authorizing the companies to issue storm recovery bonds, subject to the terms of the financing orders, and approving the Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement in its entirety. The storm recovery bonds were issued by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress on November 24, 2021.\n139\nCOVID-19 Filings\nNorth Carolina\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a joint petition on August 7, 2020, with the NCUC for deferral treatment of incremental costs and the cost of waived customer fees due to the COVID-19 pandemic. On December 29, 2021, the NCUC approved Duke Energy Carolinas' and Duke Energy Progress' joint petition to defer estimated incremental pandemic-related costs, without prejudice, to the NCUC's future determination of the appropriate ratemaking treatment ultimately to be accorded such costs in future rate case proceedings.\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Carolinas' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)    Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b)    The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c)     Included in rate base.\n(d)    Includes regulatory liabilities related to the change in the federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act and the change in the North Carolina tax rate, both discussed in Note 23. Portions are included in rate base.\n(e)    Pays interest on over-recovered costs in North Carolina. Includes certain purchased power costs in North Carolina and South Carolina and costs of distributed energy in South Carolina.\n(f)    Recovered over the life of the associated assets.\n(g)    Includes incentives on DSM/EE investments and is recovered through an annual rider mechanism.\n(h)    Earns a debt and equity return on coal ash expenditures for North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers as permitted by various regulatory orders.\n(i)    Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n140\n2017 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn August 25, 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n647\nmillion. On February 28, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the proceeding. Terms of the settlement included an ROE of\n9.9\n% and a capital structure of\n52\n% equity and\n48\n% debt. On June 22, 2018, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation of Partial Settlement and requiring a revenue reduction.\nThe North Carolina Attorney General and other parties separately filed Notices of Appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court. The North Carolina Supreme Court consolidated the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress appeals. On December 11, 2020, the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion, which affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part, the NCUC’s decisions. In the Opinion, the court upheld the NCUC's decision to include coal ash costs in the cost of service, as well as the NCUC’s discretion to allow a return on the unamortized balance of coal ash costs. The court also remanded to the NCUC a single issue to consider the assessment of support for the Public Staff’s equitable sharing argument. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021, and approved by the NCUC on March 31, 2021. The NCUC issued an Order on Remand Accepting CCR Settlement and Affirming Previous Orders Setting Rates and Imposing Penalties on June 25, 2021.\n2019 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn September 30, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the NCUC for a net rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n291\nmillion, which represented an approximate\n6\n% increase in annual base revenues. The gross rate case revenue increase request was $\n445\nmillion, which was offset by an EDIT rider of $\n154\nmillion to return to customers North Carolina and federal EDIT resulting from recent reductions in corporate tax rates. The request for a rate increase was driven by major capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, coal ash pond closure costs, accelerated coal plant depreciation and deferred 2018 storm costs. Duke Energy Carolinas requested rates be effective no later than August 1, 2020.\nOn March 25, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain issues in the base rate proceeding. On July 24, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its request for approval of its notice to customers required to implement temporary rates. On July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a joint motion with Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff notifying the commission that the parties reached a joint partial settlement with the Public Staff. Also, on July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a letter stating that it intended to update its temporary rates calculation to reflect the terms of the partial settlement. On July 31, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff filed a Second Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Second Partial Settlement), subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain remaining issues in the base rate proceeding. The remaining items litigated at hearing included recovery of deferred coal ash compliance costs that are subject to asset retirement obligation accounting, implementation of new depreciation rates and the amortization period of the loss on the hydro station sale.\nOn August 4, 2020, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an amended motion for approval of its amended notice to customers, seeking to exercise its statutory right to implement temporary rates subject to refund on or after August 24, 2020. The revenue requirement to be recovered, subject to refund, through the temporary rates was based on and consistent with the base rate component of the Second Partial Settlement and excluded the items to be litigated noted above. The NCUC approved the August 4, 2020 amended temporary rates motion on August 6, 2020, and temporary rates went into effect on August 24, 2020.\nThe Duke Energy Carolinas evidentiary hearing concluded on September 18, 2020, and post-hearing filings were made with the NCUC from all parties by November 4, 2020. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021.\nOn March 31, 2021, the NCUC issued an order approving the March 25, 2020, and July 31, 2020, partial settlements. The order includes approval of 1) an ROE of\n9.6\n% based upon a capital structure of\n52\n% equity and\n48\n% debt; 2) deferral treatment of approximately $\n800\nmillion of grid improvement projects with a return; 3) a flow back period of five years for unprotected federal EDIT; and 4) the reasonableness and prudence of $\n213\nmillion of deferred storm costs, which were removed from the rate case and for which Duke Energy Carolinas filed a petition seeking securitization in October 2020. Additionally, the order approved without modification the CCR Settlement Agreement.\nThe order denied Duke Energy Carolinas' proposal to shorten the remaining depreciable lives of certain Duke Energy Carolinas coal-fired generating units, indicating the NCUC has not had the chance to fully examine the issue within the context of an integrated resource planning (IRP) proceeding, and upon retirement the remaining net book value of these units should be placed in a regulatory asset account to be amortized over an appropriate period to be determined in a future rate case.\nOn May 21, 2021, the NCUC issued an Order Approving Rate Schedules, which resulted in a net increase of approximately $\n33\nmillion. Revised customer rates became effective on June 1, 2021.\n2018 South Carolina Rate Case\nOn November 8, 2018, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an application with the PSCSC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n168\nmillion.\nAfter hearings in March 2019, the PSCSC issued an order on May 21, 2019, which included an ROE of\n9.5\n% and a capital structure of\n53\n% equity and\n47\n% debt. The order also included the following material components:\n•\nApproval of cancellation of the Lee Nuclear Project, with Duke Energy Carolinas maintaining the combined operating license;\n•\nApproval of recovery of $\n125\nmillion (South Carolina retail portion) of Lee Nuclear Project development costs (including AFUDC through December 2017) over a\n12\n-year period, but denial of a return on the deferred balance of costs;\n•\nApproval of recovery of $\n96\nmillion of coal ash costs over a\nfive-year\nperiod with a return at Duke Energy Carolinas' WACC;\n141\n•\nDenial of recovery of $\n115\nmillion of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to the Coal Ash Act and incremental to the federal CCR rule;\n•\nApproval of a $\n66\nmillion decrease to base rates to reflect the change in ongoing tax expense, primarily the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n•\nApproval of a $\n45\nmillion decrease through the EDIT Rider to return EDIT resulting from the federal tax rate change and deferred revenues since January 2018 related to the change, to be returned in accordance with the Average Rate Assumption Method (ARAM) for protected EDIT, over a\n20\n-year period for unprotected EDIT associated with Property, Plant and Equipment, over a\nfive-year\nperiod for unprotected EDIT not associated with Property, Plant and Equipment and over a\nfive-year\nperiod for the deferred revenues; and\n•\nApproval of a $\n17\nmillion decrease through the EDIT Rider related to reductions in the North Carolina state income tax rate from 6.9% to 2.5% to be returned over a\nfive-year\nperiod.\nAs a result of the order, revised customer rates were effective June 1, 2019. On May 31, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a Petition for Rehearing or Reconsideration of that order contending substantial rights of Duke Energy Carolinas were prejudiced by unlawful, arbitrary and capricious rulings by the PSCSC on certain issues presented in the proceeding. On June 19, 2019, the PSCSC issued a directive denying Duke Energy Carolinas' request to rehear or reconsider the commission's rulings on certain issues presented in the proceeding including coal ash remediation and disposal costs, ROE and the recovery of a return on deferred operation and maintenance expenses. An order detailing the commission's decision in the directive was issued on October 18, 2019. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a notice of appeal on November 15, 2019, with the Supreme Court of South Carolina. On November 20, 2019, the South Carolina Energy Users Committee filed a Notice of Appeal with the Supreme Court of South Carolina. Initial briefs were filed on April 21, 2020, which included the South Carolina Energy User's Committee brief arguing that the PSCSC erred in allowing Duke Energy Carolinas' recovery of costs related to the Lee Nuclear Station. Response briefs were filed on July 6, 2020, and reply briefs were filed on August 11, 2020. Oral arguments were heard before the Supreme Court of South Carolina on May 26, 2021.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed the PSCSC's May 2019 order to:\n•\nDisallow cost recovery on certain CCR compliance costs the PSCSC deemed to be incremental to the federal CCR rules;\n•\nDisallow recovery of certain coal ash insurance litigation expenses;\n•\nDisallow a return on certain deferred expenses; and\n•\nAllow recovery of Lee Nuclear Project preconstruction costs.\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolinas' decision notes the prior determination made by the PSCSC that Duke Energy could submit coal ash costs for recovery that were not initially approved in the rate case order if such costs can be attributed to the CCR rules. As a result of the court's opinion, Duke Energy Carolinas recognized a pretax charge of approximately $\n160\nmillion to Impairment of assets and other charges, and a $\n31\nmillion increase in Other income and expenses, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, principally related to coal ash remediation at retired coal ash basin sites. On November 29, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a petition for rehearing on several grounds, including the Supreme Court of South Carolinas’ decision on coal ash cost recovery and certain deferred expenses. On February 1, 2022, the Supreme Court of South Carolina denied the petition for rehearing.\nOconee Nuclear Station Subsequent License Renewal\nOn June 7, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a subsequent license renewal application for the Oconee Nuclear Station (ONS) with the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to renew ONS’s operating license for an additional\n20\nyears. The subsequent license renewal would extend operations of the facility from\n60\nto\n80\nyears. The current license for units 1 and 2 expire in 2033 and the license for unit 3 expires in 2034.\nBy a Federal Register Notice dated July 28, 2021, the NRC provided a\n60\n-day comment period for persons whose interest may be affected by the issuance of a subsequent renewed license for ONS to file a request for a hearing and a petition for leave to intervene. On September 27, 2021, Beyond Nuclear and Sierra Club (Petitioners) filed a Hearing Request and Petition to Intervene (Hearing Request) and a Petition for Waiver. The Hearing Request proposed\nthree\ncontentions purporting to challenge Duke Energy Carolinas’ environmental report (ER). In general, the proposed contentions claimed that the ER did not consider certain information regarding the environmental aspects of severe accidents caused by a hypothetical failure of the Jocassee Dam, and therefore did not satisfy the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) of 1969, as amended, or the NRC’s NEPA-implementing regulations. Duke Energy Carolinas filed its answer to the proposed contentions on October 22, 2021, and the Petitioners filed their reply to Duke Energy Carolinas’ answer on November 5, 2021. On February 11, 2022, the Atomic Safety and Licensing Board (ASLB) issued its decision on the Hearing Request and found that the Petitioners failed to establish that the proposed contentions are litigable. The ASLB also denied the Petitioners' Petition for Waiver and terminated the proceeding.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress intend to seek renewal of operating licenses and\n20\n-year license extensions for all of their nuclear stations. New depreciation rates were implemented for all of the nuclear facilities during the second quarter of 2021. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n142\nDuke Energy Progress\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Progress' Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)    Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b)    The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c)    Recovery period for costs related to nuclear facilities runs through the decommissioning period of each unit.\n(d)    South Carolina storm costs are included in rate base.\n(e)    Included in rate base.\n(f)    Pays interest on over-recovered costs in North Carolina. Includes certain purchased power costs in North Carolina and South Carolina and costs of distributed energy in South Carolina.\n(g)    South Carolina retail allocated costs are earning a return.\n(h)    Earns a debt and equity return on coal ash expenditures for North Carolina and South Carolina retail customers as permitted by various regulatory orders.\n(i)    Includes incentives on DSM/EE investments and is recovered through an annual rider mechanism.\n(j)    Recovered over the life of the associated assets.\n(k)    Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n(l)    Includes regulatory liabilities related to the change in the federal tax rate as a result of the Tax Act and the change in the North Carolina tax rate, both discussed in Note 23. Portions are included in rate base.\n143\n2017 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn June 1, 2017, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n477\nmillion, which was subsequently adjusted to $\n420\nmillion. On November 22, 2017, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement resolving certain portions of the proceeding. Terms of the settlement included an ROE of\n9.9\n% and a capital structure of\n52\n% equity and\n48\n% debt. On February 23, 2018, the NCUC issued an order approving the stipulation. The Public Staff, the North Carolina Attorney General and the Sierra Club filed notices of appeal to the North Carolina Supreme Court.\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court consolidated the Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress appeals. On December 11, 2020, the North Carolina Supreme Court issued an opinion, which affirmed, in part, and reversed and remanded, in part, the NCUC’s decisions. In the Opinion, the court upheld the NCUC's decision to include coal ash costs in the cost of service, as well as the NCUC’s discretion to allow a return on the unamortized balance of coal ash costs. The court also remanded to the NCUC a single issue to consider the assessment of support for the Public Staff’s equitable sharing argument. On January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021, and approved by the NCUC on April 16, 2021. The NCUC issued an Order on Remand Accepting CCR Settlement and Affirming Previous Orders Setting Rates and Imposing Penalties on June 25, 2021.\n2019 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn October 30, 2019, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the NCUC for a net rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n464\nmillion, which represented an approximate\n12.3\n% increase in annual base revenues. The gross rate case revenue increase request was $\n586\nmillion, which was offset by riders of $\n122\nmillion, primarily an EDIT rider of $\n120\nmillion to return to customers North Carolina and federal EDIT resulting from recent reductions in corporate tax rates. The request for a rate increase was driven by major capital investments subsequent to the previous base rate case, coal ash pond closure costs, accelerated coal plant depreciation and deferred 2018 storm costs. Duke Energy Progress sought to defer and recover incremental Hurricane Dorian storm costs in this proceeding and requested rates be effective no later than September 1, 2020. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, on March 24, 2020, the NCUC suspended the procedural schedule and postponed the previously scheduled evidentiary hearing on this matter indefinitely.\nOn June 2, 2020, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed an Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain issues in the base rate proceeding. On July 27, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed a joint motion with Duke Energy Carolinas and the Public Staff notifying the commission that the parties reached a joint partial settlement with the Public Staff. On July 31, 2020, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff filed a Second Agreement and Stipulation of Partial Settlement, subject to review and approval of the NCUC, resolving certain remaining issues in the base rate proceeding. The remaining items litigated at hearing included recovery of deferred coal ash compliance costs that are subject to asset retirement obligation accounting and implementation of new depreciation rates.\nOn August 7, 2020, Duke Energy Progress filed a motion for approval of notice required to implement temporary rates, seeking to exercise its statutory right to implement temporary rates subject to refund on or after September 1, 2020. The revenue requirement to be recovered subject to refund through the temporary rates was based on and consistent with the terms of the base rate component of the settlement agreements with the Public Staff and excluded items to be litigated noted above. In addition, Duke Energy Progress also sought authorization to place a temporary decrement EDIT Rider into effect, concurrent with the temporary base rate change. The NCUC approved the August 7, 2020 temporary rates motion on August 11, 2020, and temporary rates went into effect on September 1, 2020.\nOn January 22, 2021, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Carolinas entered into the CCR Settlement Agreement with the Settling Parties, which was filed with the NCUC on January 25, 2021.\nOn April 16, 2021, the NCUC issued an order approving the June 2, 2020, and July 31, 2020, partial settlements. The order includes approval of 1) an ROE of\n9.6\n% based upon a capital structure of\n52\n% equity and\n48\n% debt; 2) deferral treatment of approximately $\n400\nmillion of grid improvement projects with a return; 3) a flow back period of five years for unprotected federal EDIT; and 4) the reasonableness and prudence of approximately $\n714\nmillion of deferred storm costs, which were removed from the rate case and for which Duke Energy Progress filed a petition seeking securitization in October 2020. Additionally, the order approved without modification the CCR Settlement Agreement.\nThe order denied Duke Energy Progress' proposal to shorten the remaining depreciable lives of certain Duke Energy Progress coal-fired generating units, indicating the NCUC has not had the chance to fully examine the issue within the context of an IRP proceeding, and upon retirement the remaining net book value of these units should be placed in a regulatory asset account to be amortized over an appropriate period to be determined in a future rate case.\nOn May 21, 2021, the NCUC issued an Order Approving Rate Schedules, which resulted in a net increase of approximately $\n178\nmillion. Revised customer rates became effective on June 1, 2021.\n2018 South Carolina Rate Case\nOn November 8, 2018, Duke Energy Progress filed an application with the PSCSC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n59\nmillion.\nAfter hearings in April 2019, the PSCSC issued an order on May 21, 2019, which included an ROE of\n9.5\n% and a capital structure of\n53\n% equity and\n47\n% debt. The order also included the following material components:\n•\nApproval of recovery of $\n4\nmillion of coal ash costs over a five-year period with a return at Duke Energy Progress' WACC;\n•\nDenial of recovery of $\n65\nmillion of certain coal ash costs deemed to be related to the Coal Ash Act and incremental to the federal CCR rule;\n•\nApproval of a $\n17\nmillion decrease to base rates to reflect the change in ongoing tax expense, primarily the reduction in the federal income tax rate from 35% to 21%;\n144\n•\nApproval of a $\n12\nmillion decrease through the EDIT Tax Savings Rider resulting from the federal tax rate change and deferred revenues since January 2018 related to the change, to be returned in accordance with ARAM for protected EDIT, over a\n20\n-year period for unprotected EDIT associated with Property, Plant and Equipment, over a\nfive-year\nperiod for unprotected EDIT not associated with Property, Plant and Equipment and over a\nthree-year\nperiod for the deferred revenues; and\n•\nApproval of a $\n12\nmillion increase due to the expiration of EDIT related to reductions in the North Carolina state income tax rate from 6.9% to 2.5%.\nAs a result of the order, revised customer rates were effective June 1, 2019. On May 31, 2019, Duke Energy Progress filed a Petition for Rehearing or Reconsideration of that order contending substantial rights of Duke Energy Progress were prejudiced by unlawful, arbitrary and capricious rulings by the PSCSC on certain issues presented in the proceeding. On June 19, 2019, the PSCSC issued a directive denying Duke Energy Progress' request to rehear or reconsider the commission's rulings on certain issues presented in the proceeding including coal ash remediation and disposal costs, ROE and the recovery of a return on deferred operation and maintenance expenses, but allowing additional litigation-related costs. As a result of the directive allowing litigation-related costs, customer rates were revised effective July 1, 2019. An order detailing the commission's decision in the directive was issued on October 18, 2019. In November 2019, Duke Energy Progress appealed the decision to the Supreme Court of South Carolina.\nOn October 27, 2021, the Supreme Court of South Carolina affirmed the PSCSC's May 2019 order to:\n•\nDisallow cost recovery on certain CCR compliance costs the PSCSC deemed to be incremental to the federal CCR rules;\n•\nDisallow recovery of certain coal ash insurance litigation expenses; and\n•\nDisallow a return on certain deferred expenses.\nThe Supreme Court of South Carolinas' decision notes the prior determination made by the PSCSC that Duke Energy could submit coal ash costs for recovery that were not initially approved in the rate case order if such costs can be attributed to the CCR rules. As a result of the court's opinion, Duke Energy Progress recognized a pretax charge of approximately $\n42\nmillion to Impairment of assets and other charges, and a $\n6\nmillion increase in Other income and expenses, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended December 31, 2021, principally related to coal ash remediation at retired coal ash basin sites. On November 29, 2021, Duke Energy Progress filed a petition for rehearing on several grounds, including the Supreme Court of South Carolinas’ decision on coal ash cost recovery and certain deferred expenses. On February 1, 2022, the Supreme Court of South Carolina denied the petition for rehearing.\nFERC Return on Equity Complaints\nOn October 11, 2019, North Carolina Eastern Municipal Power Agency (NCEMPA) filed a complaint at the FERC against Duke Energy Progress pursuant to Section 206 of the Federal Power Act (FPA), alleging that the\n11\n% stated ROE component contained in the demand formula rate in the Full Requirements Power Purchase Agreement (FRPPA) between NCEMPA and Duke Energy Progress is unjust and unreasonable. On July 16, 2020, the FERC set this matter for hearing and settlement judge procedures and established a refund effective date of October 11, 2019. In its order setting the matter for settlement, the FERC allowed for the consideration of variations to the base transmission-related ROE methodology developed in its Order No. 569-A, through the introduction of “specific facts and circumstances” involving issues specific to the case. The parties reached a settlement in principle at a settlement conference on January 7, 2021, and filed a settlement package on March 10, 2021. The FERC Trial Staff filed comments in support of the settlement. On April 19, 2021, the Settlement Judge certified the settlement to the FERC as an uncontested settlement. The FERC approved the settlement on May 25, 2021, and Duke Energy Progress filed compliance documents on June 10, 2021. The FERC accepted the compliance filing on October 8, 2021.\nOn October 16, 2020, North Carolina Electric Membership Corporation (NCEMC) filed a complaint at the FERC against Duke Energy Progress pursuant to Section 206 of the FPA, alleging that the\n11\n% stated ROE component in the demand formula rate in the Power Supply and Coordination Agreement between NCEMC and Duke Energy Progress is unjust and unreasonable. Under FPA Section 206, the earliest refund effective date that the FERC can establish is the date of the filing of the complaint. Duke Energy Progress responded to the complaint on November 20, 2020, seeking dismissal, demonstrating that the\n11\n% ROE is just and reasonable for the service provided. The parties filed responsive pleadings and are awaiting an order from the FERC. Duke Energy Progress cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n145\nDuke Energy Florida\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)    Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b)    The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c)    Included in rate base.\n(d)    Certain costs earn/pay a return.\n(e)    Earns a debt return/interest once collections begin.\n(f)    Earns commercial paper rate.\n(g)    Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n2021 Settlement Agreement\nOn January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed a Settlement Agreement (the “2021 Settlement”) with the FPSC. The parties to the 2021 Settlement include Duke Energy Florida, the Office of Public Counsel (OPC), the Florida Industrial Power Users Group, White Springs Agricultural Chemicals, Inc. d/b/a PCS Phosphate and NUCOR Steel Florida, Inc. (collectively, the “Parties”).\nPursuant to the 2021 Settlement, the Parties agreed to a base rate stay-out provision that expires year-end 2024; however, Duke Energy Florida is allowed an increase to its base rates of an incremental $\n67\nmillion in 2022, $\n49\nmillion in 2023 and $\n79\nmillion in 2024, subject to adjustment in the event of tax reform during the years 2021, 2022 and 2023. The Parties also agreed to an ROE band of\n8.85\n% to\n10.85\n% with a midpoint of\n9.85\n% based on a capital structure of\n53\n% equity and\n47\n% debt. The ROE band can be increased by\n25\nbasis points if the average 30-year U.S. Treasury rate increases\n50\nbasis points or more over a six-month period in which case the midpoint ROE would rise from\n9.85\n% to\n10.10\n%. Duke Energy Florida will also be able to retain the retail portion of the DOE award of approximately $\n173\nmillion for spent nuclear fuel, which is expected to be received in 2022, in order to mitigate customer rates over the term of the 2021 Settlement. In return, Duke Energy Florida will be able to recognize the $\n173\nmillion into earnings from 2022 through 2024.\nIn addition to these terms, the 2021 Settlement contained provisions related to the accelerated depreciation of Crystal River Units 4-5, the approval of approximately $\n1\nbillion in future investments in new cost-effective solar power, the implementation of a new Electric Vehicle Charging Station Program and the deferral and recovery of costs in connection with the implementation of Duke Energy Florida’s Vision Florida program, which explores various emerging non-carbon emitting generation technology, distributed technologies and resiliency projects, among other things. The 2021 Settlement also resolved remaining unrecovered storm costs for Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\nThe FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021, issuing an order on June 4, 2021. Revised customer rates became effective January 1, 2022, with subsequent base rate increases effective January 1, 2023, and January 1, 2024.\n146\nStorm Restoration Cost Recovery\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on April 30, 2019, to recover $\n223\nmillion of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Michael, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement, and the FPSC approved the petition on June 11, 2019. The FPSC also approved allowing Duke Energy Florida to use the tax savings resulting from the Tax Act to recover these storm costs in lieu of implementing a storm surcharge. Approved storm costs were fully recovered by year-end 2021. On November 22, 2019, Duke Energy Florida filed a petition for approval of actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael in the amount of $\n191\nmillion plus interest. On May 19, 2020, Duke Energy Florida filed a supplemental true up reducing the actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs related to Hurricane Michael by approximately $\n3\nmillion, resulting in a total request to recover $\n188\nmillion actual retail recoverable storm restoration costs, plus interest. Approximately $\n80\nmillion of these costs are included in Regulatory assets within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2020.\nDuke Energy Florida filed a petition with the FPSC on December 19, 2019, to recover $\n169\nmillion of estimated retail incremental storm restoration costs for Hurricane Dorian, consistent with the provisions in the 2017 Settlement and the FPSC approved the petition on February 24, 2020. The final actual amount of $\n145\nmillion was filed on September 30, 2020. The 2021 Settlement resolved all matters regarding storm cost recovery relating to Hurricane Michael and Hurricane Dorian.\nClean Energy Connection\nOn July 1, 2020, Duke Energy Florida petitioned the FPSC for approval of a voluntary solar program. The program consists of\n10\nnew solar generating facilities with combined capacity of approximately\n750\nMW. The program allows participants to support cost-effective solar development in Florida by paying a subscription fee based on per kilowatt-subscriptions and receiving a credit on their bill based on the actual generation associated with their portion of the solar portfolio. The estimated cost of the\n10\nnew solar generation facilities is approximately $\n1\nbillion over the next\nthree years\n, and this investment will be included in base rates offset by the revenue from the subscription fees. The credits will be included for recovery in the fuel cost recovery clause. The FPSC approved the program in January 2021.\nOn February 24, 2021, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) filed a notice of appeal of the FPSC’s order approving the Clean Energy Connection to the Supreme Court of Florida. LULAC's initial brief was filed on May 26, 2021, and Appellees' response briefs were filed on July 26, 2021. LULAC's reply brief was filed on September 24, 2021, and its request for oral argument was filed on September 28, 2021. The Supreme Court of Florida heard the oral argument on February 9, 2022. The FPSC approval order remains in effect pending the outcome of the appeal. Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter\n.\n147\nDuke Energy Ohio\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)    Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b)    The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c)    Included in rate base.\n(d)    Recovery over the life of the associated assets.\n(e)    Recovered via a rider mechanism.\n(f)    Includes incentives on DSM/EE investments.\n(g)    Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\nDuke Energy Ohio Electric Base Rate Case\nDuke Energy Ohio filed with the PUCO an electric distribution base rate case application on October 1, 2021, with supporting testimony filed on October 15, 2021, requesting an increase in electric distribution base rates of approximately $\n55\nmillion and an ROE of\n10.3\n%. This is an approximate\n3.3\n% average increase in the customer's total bill across all customer classes. The drivers for this case are capital invested since Duke Energy Ohio's last electric distribution base rate case in 2017. Duke Energy Ohio is also seeking to adjust the caps on its Distribution Capital Investment (DCI) Rider. Duke Energy Ohio anticipates the PUCO will rule on the request by the summer of 2022. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n148\nOhio House Bill 6 and House Bill 128\nOn July 23, 2019, House Bill 6 was signed into law and became effective January 1, 2020. Among other things, the bill allowed for funding through a rider mechanism referred to as the Clean Air Fund (CAF) Rider, of\ntwo\nnuclear generating facilities located in Northern Ohio owned by Energy Harbor (f/k/a FirstEnergy Solutions) and certain renewable resources, repeal of energy efficiency mandates and recovery of prudently incurred costs, net of any revenues, for Ohio investor-owned utilities that are participants under the OVEC power agreement. The OVEC recovery is through a non-bypassable rider that replaced any existing recovery mechanism approved by the PUCO and will remain in place through 2030. As such, Duke Energy Ohio created the Legacy Generation Rider that replaced the Price Stabilization Rider effective January 1, 2020. The amounts recoverable from customers are subject to an annual cap, with incremental costs that exceed such cap eligible for deferral and recovery, subject to review. See Note 17 for additional discussion of Duke Energy Ohio's ownership interest in OVEC. House Bill 128 (HB 128) was signed into law on March 31, 2021, and became effective June 30, 2021. The bill removes nuclear plant funding included in HB 6, eliminates the CAF Rider and establishes the Solar Generation Fund Rider to recover the renewable investments originally included in HB 6. HB 128 does not impact OVEC cost recovery or any transmission or distribution rider.\nEnergy Efficiency Cost Recovery\nIn response to changes in Ohio law that eliminated Ohio's energy efficiency mandates, the PUCO issued an order on February 26, 2020, directing utilities to wind down their demand-side management programs by September 30, 2020, and to terminate the programs by December 31, 2020. Duke Energy Ohio took the following actions:\n•\nOn March 27, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application for rehearing seeking clarification on the final true up and reconciliation process after 2020. On November 18, 2020, the PUCO issued an order replacing the cost cap previously imposed upon Duke Energy Ohio with a cap on shared savings recovery. On December 18, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an additional application for rehearing challenging, among other things, the imposition of the cap on shared savings. On January 13, 2021, the application for rehearing was granted for further consideration.\n•\nOn October 9, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application to implement a voluntary energy efficiency program portfolio to commence on January 1, 2021. The application proposed a mechanism for recovery of program costs and a benefit associated with avoided transmission and distribution costs. The application remains under review.\n•\nOn November 18, 2020, the PUCO issued an order directing all utilities to set their energy efficiency riders to zero effective January 1, 2021, and to file a separate application for final reconciliation of all energy efficiency costs prior to December 31, 2020.\n•\nEffective January 1, 2021, Duke Energy Ohio suspended its energy efficiency programs.\n•\nOn June 14, 2021, the PUCO issued an entry for each utility to file by July 15, 2021, a proposal to reestablish low-income programs through December 31, 2021. Duke Energy Oho filed its application on July 14, 2021.\nDuke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nNatural Gas Pipeline Extension\nDuke Energy Ohio is installing a new natural gas pipeline (the Central Corridor Project) in its Ohio service territory to increase system reliability and enable the retirement of older infrastructure. Duke Energy Ohio currently estimates the pipeline development costs and construction activities will range from $\n185\nmillion to $\n195\nmillion in direct costs (excluding overheads and AFUDC) and that construction of the pipeline extension will be completed in February 2022. An evidentiary hearing on Duke Energy Ohio's application for a Certificate of Environmental Compatibility and Public Need concluded on April 11, 2019. On November 21, 2019, the Ohio Power Siting Board (OPSB) approved Duke Energy Ohio's application subject to\n41\nconditions on construction. Applications for rehearing were filed by several stakeholders on December 23, 2019, arguing that the OPSB approval was incorrect. On February 20, 2020, the OPSB denied the rehearing requests. On April 15, 2020, those stakeholders filed a notice of appeal at the Supreme Court of Ohio of the OPSB’s decision approving Duke Energy Ohio’s Central Corridor Project application. The Supreme Court of Ohio affirmed the OPSB order on September 22, 2021.\nOn September 22, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application with the OPSB for approval to amend the certificated pipeline route due to changes in the route negotiated with property owners and municipalities. On January 21, 2021, the OPSB approved the amended filing with recommended conditions that reaffirm previous conditions and provide guidance regarding local permitting and construction supervision.\nMGP Cost Recovery\nIn an order issued in 2013, the PUCO approved Duke Energy Ohio's deferral and recovery of costs related to environmental remediation at\ntwo\nsites (East End and West End) that housed former MGP operations. Duke Energy Ohio has collected approximately $\n55\nmillion in environmental remediation costs incurred between 2008 through 2012 through Rider MGP, which is currently suspended. Duke Energy Ohio has made annual applications with the PUCO to recover its incremental remediation costs consistent with the PUCO’s directive in Duke Energy Ohio’s 2012 natural gas base rate case. To date, the PUCO has not ruled on Duke Energy Ohio’s annual applications for the calendar years 2013 through 2019. On September 28, 2018, the Staff of the PUCO (Staff) issued a report recommending a disallowance of approximately $\n12\nmillion of the $\n26\nmillion in MGP remediation costs incurred between 2013 through 2017 that the Staff believes are not eligible for recovery. The Staff interprets the PUCO’s 2013 order granting Duke Energy Ohio recovery of MGP remediation as limiting the recovery to work directly on the East End and West End sites. On October 30, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio filed reply comments objecting to the Staff’s recommendations and explaining, among other things, the obligation Duke Energy Ohio has under Ohio law to remediate all areas impacted by the former MGPs and not just physical property that housed the former plants and equipment. On March 29, 2019, Duke Energy Ohio filed its annual application to recover incremental remediation expense for the calendar year 2018 seeking recovery of approximately $\n20\nmillion in remediation costs. On July 12, 2019, the Staff recommended a disallowance of approximately $\n11\nmillion for work that the Staff believes occurred in areas not authorized for recovery. Additionally, the Staff recommended that any discussion pertaining to Duke Energy Ohio's recovery of ongoing MGP costs should be directly tied to or netted against insurance proceeds collected by Duke Energy Ohio. An evidentiary hearing concluded on November 21, 2019. Initial briefs were filed on January 17, 2020, and reply briefs were filed on February 14, 2020.\n149\nOn March 31, 2020, Duke Energy Ohio filed its annual application to recover incremental MGP remediation expense seeking recovery of approximately $\n39\nmillion in remediation costs incurred during 2019. On July 23, 2020, the Staff recommended a disallowance of approximately $\n4\nmillion for work the Staff believes occurred in areas not authorized for recovery. Additionally, the Staff recommended insurance proceeds, net of litigation costs and attorney fees, should be paid to customers and not be held by Duke Energy Ohio until all investigation and remediation is complete. Duke Energy Ohio filed comments in response to the Staff's report on August 21, 2020, and intervenor comments were filed on November 9, 2020.\nThe 2013 PUCO order also contained conditional deadlines for completing the MGP environmental remediation and the deferral of related remediation costs. Subsequent to the order, the deadline was extended to December 31, 2019. On May 10, 2019, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application requesting a continuation of its existing deferral authority for MGP remediation that must occur after December 31, 2019. On July 12, 2019, the Staff recommended the commission deny the deferral authority request. On September 13, 2019, intervenor comments were filed opposing Duke Energy Ohio's request for continuation of existing deferral authority and on October 2, 2019, Duke Energy Ohio filed reply comments.\nA Stipulation and Recommendation was filed jointly by Duke Energy Ohio, the Staff, the Office of the Ohio Consumers' Counsel and the Ohio Energy Group on August 31, 2021, which is subject to review and approval by the PUCO. I\nf approved, the Stipulation and Recommendation would, among other things, resolve all open issues regarding MGP remediation costs incurred between 2013 and 2019, Duke Energy Ohio’s request for additional deferral authority beyond 2019 and the pending issues related to the Tax Act as it relates to Duke Energy Ohio’s natural gas operations. These impacts are not expected to have a material impact on Duke Energy Ohio's financial statements. The\nStipulation and Recommendation\nfurther acknowledges Duke Energy Ohio’s ability to file a request for additional deferral authority in the future related to environmental remediation of any MGP impacts in the Ohio River if necessary, subject to specific conditions. On October 15, 2021, the PUCO granted motions to intervene filed in September 2021 by Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. and Retail Energy Supply Association on a limited basis. An evidentiary hearing was held on\nNovember 18, 2021, and briefing was concluded on December 23, 2021\n.\nDuke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nTax Act – Ohio\nOn December 21, 2018, Duke Energy Ohio filed an application to change its base rate tariffs and establish a new rider to implement the benefits of the Tax Act for natural gas customers. Duke Energy Ohio requested commission approval to implement the tariff changes and rider effective April 1, 2019. The new rider will flow through to customers the benefit of the reduction in the statutory federal tax rate from 35% to 21% since January 1, 2018, all future benefits of the lower tax rates and a full refund of deferred income taxes collected at the higher tax rates in prior years. Deferred income taxes subject to normalization rules will be refunded consistent with federal law and deferred income taxes not subject to normalization rules will be refunded over a 10-year period. The PUCO established a procedural schedule and testimony was filed on July 31, 2019. An evidentiary hearing occurred on August 7, 2019. Initial briefs were filed on September 11, 2019. Reply briefs were filed on September 25, 2019. The Stipulation and Recommendation filed on August 31, 2021, disclosed in the MGP Cost Recovery matter above, also resolves the outstanding issues in this proceeding. On October 15, 2021,\nthe PUCO granted motions to intervene filed in September 2021 by Interstate Gas Supply, Inc. and Retail Energy Supply Association on a limited basis. An evidentiary hearing was held on\nNovember 18, 2021, and briefing was concluded on December 23, 2021. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Kentucky Natural Gas Base Rate Case\nOn June 1, 2021, Duke Energy Kentucky filed an application with the KPSC requesting an increase in natural gas base rates of approximately $\n15\nmillion, an approximate\n13\n% average increase across all customer classes. The drivers for this case are capital invested since Duke Energy Kentucky's last natural gas base rate case in 2018. Duke Energy Kentucky also sought implementation of a rider in order to recover from or pay to customers the financial impact of governmental directives and mandates, including changes in federal or state tax rates and regulations issued by the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA).\nOn October 8, 2021, Duke Energy Kentucky filed a Stipulation and Recommendation jointly with the Kentucky Attorney General, subject to review and approval by the KPSC, which if approved, would resolve the case. The Stipulation and Recommendation included a $\n9\nmillion increase in base revenues, an ROE of\n9.375\n% for natural gas base rates and\n9.3\n% for natural gas riders, a rider for PHMSA-required capital investments with an annual\n5\n% rate increase cap and a\nfour-year\nnatural gas base rate case stay out. The evidentiary hearing was held on October 18, 2021. On December 28, 2021, the KPSC approved the Stipulation and Recommendation with minor modifications, authorizing a $\n9\nmillion increase\n. Rates were effective January 4, 2022.\nMidwest Propane Caverns\nDuke Energy Ohio uses propane stored in caverns to meet peak demand during winter. Once the Central Corridor Project is complete, the propane peaking facilities will no longer be necessary and will be retired. On October 7, 2021, Duke Energy Ohio requested deferral treatment of the property, plant and equipment as well as costs related to propane inventory and decommissioning costs. On January 6, 2022, the Staff issued a report recommending deferral authority for costs related to propane inventory and decommissioning but not for the net book value of the remaining assets. As a result of the Staff's report, Duke Energy Ohio recorded a $\n19\nmillion charge to Impairment of assets and other charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income in the fourth quarter of 2021. There is approximately $\n6\nmillion and $\n27\nmillion in Net, property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, related to the propane caverns. The PUCO established a procedural schedule for the submission of comments by March 7, 2022. Duke Energy Ohio cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nRegional Transmission Organization Realignment\nDuke Energy Ohio, including Duke Energy Kentucky, transferred control of its transmission assets from MISO to PJM, effective December 31, 2011. The PUCO approved a settlement related to Duke Energy Ohio’s recovery of certain costs of the RTO realignment via a non-bypassable rider. Duke Energy Ohio is allowed to recover all MISO Transmission Expansion Planning (MTEP) costs directly or indirectly charged to Ohio customers. The KPSC also approved a request to effect the RTO realignment, subject to a commitment not to seek double recovery in a future rate case of the transmission expansion fees that may be charged by MISO and PJM in the same period or overlapping periods.\n150\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance of Duke Energy Ohio’s recorded liability for its exit obligation and share of MTEP costs recorded in Other within Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The retail portions of MTEP costs billed by MISO are recovered by Duke Energy Ohio through a non-bypassable rider. As of December 31, 2021, and 2020, $\n33\nmillion and $\n37\nmillion, respectively, are recorded in Regulatory assets on Duke Energy Ohio's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuke Energy Indiana\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Duke Energy Indiana's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)    Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b)    The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c)    Included in rate base.\n(d)    Refunded over the life of the associated assets.\n(e)    Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n151\n2019 Indiana Rate Case\nOn July 2, 2019, Duke Energy Indiana filed a general rate case with the IURC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n395\nmillion. The rebuttal case, filed on December 4, 2019, updated the requested revenue requirement to result in a\n15.6\n% or $\n396\nmillion average retail rate increase, including the impacts of the Utility Receipts Tax. Hearings concluded on February 7, 2020. On June 29, 2020, the IURC issued an order in the rate case approving a revenue increase of $\n146\nmillion before certain adjustments and ratemaking refinements. The order approved Duke Energy Indiana's requested forecasted rate base of $\n10.2\nbillion as of December 31, 2020, including the Edwardsport Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) Plant. The IURC reduced Duke Energy Indiana's request by slightly more than $\n200\nmillion, when accounting for the utility receipts tax and other adjustments. Approximately\n50\n% of the reduction was due to a prospective change in depreciation and use of regulatory asset for the end-of-life inventory at retired generating plants, approximately\n20\n% is due to the approved ROE of\n9.7\n% versus the requested ROE of\n10.4\n% and approximately\n20\n% was related to miscellaneous earnings neutral adjustments. Step one rates were estimated to be approximately\n75\n% of the total and became effective on July 30, 2020. Step two rates are estimated to be the remaining\n25\n% of the total rate increase. Step two rates were approved on July 28, 2021, and implemented in August 2021. Step two rates are based on a return on equity of\n9.7\n% and actual December 31, 2020 capital structure with a\n54\n% equity component. Step two rates will be reconciled to January 1, 2021. Several groups appealed the IURC order to the Indiana Court of Appeals. Appellate briefs were filed on October 14, 2020, focusing on three issues: wholesale sales allocations, coal ash basin cost recovery and the Edwardsport IGCC operating and maintenance expense level approved. The appeal was fully briefed in\nJanuary 2021, a\nnd an oral argument was held on April 8, 2021. The Indiana Court of Appeals affirmed the IURC decision on May 13, 2021. The Indiana Office of Utility Consumer Counselor (OUCC) and the Duke Industrial Group filed a joint petition to transfer the rate case appeal to the Indiana Supreme Court on June 28, 2021. Response briefs were filed July 19, 2021. The Indiana Supreme Court granted the petition to transfer on September 16, 2021, and oral arguments were heard on November 16, 2021. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\n2020 Indiana Coal Ash Recovery Case\nIn Duke Energy Indiana’s 2019 rate case, the IURC approved coal ash basin closure costs expended through 2018 including financing costs as a regulatory asset and included in rate base. The IURC also opened a subdocket for post-2018 coal ash related expenditures. Duke Energy Indiana filed testimony on April 15, 2020, in the coal ash subdocket requesting recovery for the post-2018 coal ash basin closure costs for plans that have been approved by the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) as well as continuing deferral, with carrying costs, on the balance. An evidentiary hearing was held on September 14, 2020. Briefing was completed by mid-September 2021. On November 3, 2021, the IURC issued an order allowing recovery for post-2018 coal ash basin closure costs for the plans that have been approved by IDEM, as well as continuing deferral, with carrying costs, on the balance. The OUCC filed a notice of appeal to the Indiana Court of Appeals on December 3, 2021. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nPiedmont\nRegulatory Assets and Liabilities\nThe following tables present the regulatory assets and liabilities recorded on Piedmont's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n152\n(a)    Regulatory assets and liabilities are excluded from rate base unless otherwise noted.\n(b)    The expected recovery or refund period varies or has not been determined.\n(c)    Included in rate base.\n(d)    Recovery over the life of the associated assets.\n(e)    Certain costs earn/pay a return.\n(f)    Balance will fluctuate with changes in the market. Current contracts extend into 2031.\n(g)    Recovered primarily over the average remaining service periods or life expectancies of employees covered by the benefit plans. See Note 22 for additional detail.\n2020 Tennessee Rate Case\nOn July 2, 2020, Piedmont filed an application with the TPUC, its first general rate case in Tennessee in nine years, for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n30\nmillion, which represents an approximate\n15\n% increase in annual revenues. The rate increase is driven by significant infrastructure upgrade investments since Piedmont's previous rate case. Approximately half of the plant additions being added to rate base are categories of capital investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was approved in 2013. Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $\n26\nmillion in December 2020. As authorized under Tennessee law, Piedmont implemented interim rates on January 2, 2021, at the level requested in its adjusted request. A settlement reached with the Tennessee Consumer Advocate in mid-January was approved by the TPUC on February 16, 2021. The settlement results in an increase of revenues of approximately $\n16\nmillion and an ROE of\n9.8\n%. Revised customer rates became effective on January 2, 2021. Piedmont refunded customers the difference between bills previously rendered under interim rates and such bills if rendered under approved rates, plus interest in April 2021.\n2021 North Carolina Rate Case\nOn March 22, 2021, Piedmont filed an application with the NCUC for a rate increase for retail customers of approximately $\n109\nmillion, which represents an approximate\n10\n% increase in retail revenues. The rate increase is driven by customer growth and significant infrastructure upgrade investments (plant additions) since the last general rate case. Approximately\n70\n% of the plant additions being rolled into rate base are categories of plant investment not covered under the IMR mechanism, which was originally approved as part of the 2013 North Carolina Rate Case. On July 28, 2021, Piedmont amended its requested increase to approximately $\n97\nmillion.\nOn September 7, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff, the Carolina Utility Customers Association, Inc. and the Carolina Industrial Group for Fair Utility Rates IV filed a Stipulation of Partial Settlement (Stipulation), which is subject to review and approval by the NCUC, resolving most issues between these parties. Major components of the Stipulation include:\n•\nA return on equity of\n9.6\n% and a capital structure of\n51.6\n% equity and\n48.4\n% debt;\n•\nContinuation of the IMR mechanism and margin decoupling; and\n•\nA base rate increase of approximately $\n67\nmillion, subject to completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project.\nAn evidentiary hearing to review the Stipulation and other issues concluded on September 9, 2021. On October 12, 2021, Piedmont notified the NCUC of its intent to implement the stipulated rates effective November 1, 2021, on a temporary basis and subject to refund. On October 18, 2021, Piedmont and the Public Staff filed supplemental testimony attesting to the completion of the Robeson County LNG facility and the Pender Onslow County expansion project and to the propriety of including the capital investment for these two projects in this proceeding. On January 6, 2022, the NCUC issued an order approving the Stipulation. No refunds need to be rendered to customers arising from Piedmont's implementation of interim rates.\nOTHER REGULATORY MATTERS\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline, LLC\nAtlantic Coast Pipeline (ACP pipeline) was planned to be an approximately 600-mile interstate natural gas pipeline running from West Virginia to North Carolina. Duke Energy indirectly owns a\n47\n% interest, which is accounted for as an equity method investment through its Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\nAs a result of the uncertainty created by various legal rulings, the potential impact on the cost and schedule for the project, the ongoing legal challenges and the risk of additional legal challenges and delays through the construction period and Dominion’s decision to sell substantially all of its gas transmission and storage segment assets, Duke Energy's Board of Directors and management decided that it was not prudent to continue to invest in the project. On July 5, 2020, Duke Energy and Dominion announced the cancellation of the ACP pipeline project.\nAs part of the pretax charges to earnings of approximately $\n2.1\nbillion recorded in June 2020, within Equity in earnings (losses) of unconsolidated affiliates on the Duke Energy Consolidated Statements of Operations, Duke Energy established liabilities related to the cancellation of the ACP pipeline proje\nct. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $\n855\nmillion to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. At December 31, 2021, there is $\n47\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion within Other Current Liabilities and Other Noncurrent Liabilities, respectively, in the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment\n. The liabilities represent Duke Energy's obligation of approximately $\n100\nmillion to satisfy remaining ARO requirements to restore construction sites.\nSee Notes 7 and 12 for additional information regarding this transaction.\n153\nPotential Coal Plant Retirements\nThe Subsidiary Registrants periodically file integrated resource plans (IRPs) with their state regulatory commissions. The IRPs provide a view of forecasted energy needs over a long term (10 to 20 years) and options being considered to meet those needs. IRPs filed by the Subsidiary Registrants included planning assumptions to potentially retire certain coal-fired generating facilities in North Carolina and Indiana earlier than their current estimated useful lives. Duke Energy continues to evaluate the potential need to retire these coal-fired generating facilities earlier than the current estimated useful lives and plans to seek regulatory recovery for amounts that would not be otherwise recovered when any of these assets are retired.\nThe table below contains the net carrying value of generating facilities planned for retirement or included in recent IRPs as evaluated for potential retirement. Dollar amounts in the table below are included in Net property, plant and equipment on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021, and exclude capitalized asset retirement costs.\n(a)    As part of the 2015 resolution of a lawsuit involving alleged New Source Review violations, Duke Energy Carolinas must retire Allen Steam Station Units 1 through 3 by December 31, 2024. The long-term energy options considered in the IRP could result in retirement of these units earlier than their current estimated useful lives. Unit 3 with a capacity of\n270\nMW and a net book value of $\n26\nmillion at December 31, 2020, was retired in March 2021, and unit 2 with a capacity of\n167\nMW and a net book value of $\n44\nmillion at December 31, 2020, was retired in December 2021.\n(b)    These units were included in the IRP filed by Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress in North Carolina and South Carolina on September 1, 2020. The long-term energy options considered in the IRP could result in retirement of these units earlier than their current estimated useful lives. In 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed North Carolina rate cases that included depreciation studies that accelerate end-of-life dates for these plants. The NCUC issued orders in the 2019 rate cases of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress on March 31, 2021, and April 16, 2021, respectively, in which the proposals to shorten the remaining depreciable lives of these units were denied, while indicating the IRP proceeding was the appropriate proceeding for the review of generating plant retirements. Allen Unit 4 with a capacity of\n267\nMW and a net book value of $\n170\nmillion at December 31, 2020, was retired in December 2021.\n(c)    On January 14, 2021, Duke Energy Florida filed the 2021 Settlement with the FPSC, which proposed depreciation rates reflecting retirement dates for Duke Energy Florida's last\ntwo\ncoal-fired generating facilities, Crystal River Units 4-5,\neight years\nahead of schedule in 2034 rather than in 2042. The FPSC approved the 2021 Settlement on May 4, 2021.\n(d)    Gallagher Units 2 and 4 with a total capacity of\n280\nMW and a total net book value of $\n102\nmillion at December 31, 2020, were retired on June 1, 2021.\n(e)    The rate case filed July 2, 2019, included proposed depreciation rates reflecting retirement dates from 2026 to 2038. The depreciation rates reflecting these updated retirement dates were approved by the IURC as part of the rate case order issued on June 29, 2020.\n4.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nINSURANCE\nGeneral Insurance\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have insurance and reinsurance coverage either directly or through indemnification from Duke Energy’s captive insurance company, Bison, and its affiliates, consistent with companies engaged in similar commercial operations with similar type properties. The Duke Energy Registrants’ coverage includes (i) commercial general liability coverage for liabilities arising to third parties for bodily injury and property damage; (ii) workers’ compensation; (iii) automobile liability coverage; and (iv) property coverage for all real and personal property damage. Real and personal property damage coverage excludes electric transmission and distribution lines, but includes damages arising from boiler and machinery breakdowns, earthquakes, flood damage and extra expense, but not outage or replacement power coverage. All coverage is subject to certain deductibles or retentions, sublimits, exclusions, terms and conditions common for companies with similar types of operations. The Duke Energy Registrants self-insure their electric transmission and distribution lines against loss due to storm damage and other natural disasters. As discussed further in Note 3, Duke Energy Florida maintains a storm damage reserve and has a regulatory mechanism to recover the cost of named storms on an expedited basis.\nThe cost of the Duke Energy Registrants’ coverage can fluctuate from year to year reflecting claims history and conditions of the insurance and reinsurance markets.\n154\nIn the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance and reinsurance available might not be adequate to cover claims and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on the Duke Energy Registrants’ results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available.\nNuclear Insurance\nDuke Energy Carolinas owns and operates McGuire and Oconee and operates and has a partial ownership interest in Catawba. McGuire and Catawba each have\ntwo\nreactors. Oconee has\nthree\nreactors. The other joint owners of Catawba reimburse Duke Energy Carolinas for certain expenses associated with nuclear insurance per the Catawba joint owner agreements.\nDuke Energy Progress owns and operates Robinson, Brunswick and Harris. Robinson and Harris each have\none\nreactor. Brunswick has\ntwo\nreactors.\nDuke Energy Florida owns Crystal River Unit 3, which permanently ceased operation in 2013 and achieved a SAFSTOR condition in July 2019. On October 1, 2020, Crystal River Unit 3 changed decommissioning strategies from SAFSTOR to DECON.\nIn the event of a loss, terms and amounts of insurance available might not be adequate to cover property damage and other expenses incurred. Uninsured losses and other expenses, to the extent not recovered by other sources, could have a material effect on Duke Energy Carolinas’, Duke Energy Progress’ and Duke Energy Florida’s results of operations, cash flows or financial position. Each company is responsible to the extent losses may be excluded or exceed limits of the coverage available.\nNuclear Liability Coverage\nThe Price-Anderson Act requires owners of nuclear reactors to provide for public nuclear liability protection per nuclear incident up to a maximum total financial protection liability. The maximum total financial protection liability, which is approximately $\n13.5\nbillion, is subject to change every five years for inflation and for the number of licensed reactors. Total nuclear liability coverage consists of a combination of private primary nuclear liability insurance coverage and a mandatory industry risk-sharing program to provide for excess nuclear liability coverage above the maximum reasonably available private primary coverage. The U.S. Congress could impose revenue-raising measures on the nuclear industry to pay claims.\nPrimary Liability Insurance\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have purchased the maximum reasonably available private primary nuclear liability insurance as required by law, which is $\n450\nmillion per station. Duke Energy Florida has purchased $\n100\nmillion primary nuclear liability insurance in compliance with the law.\nExcess Liability Program\nThis program provides $\n13.1\nbillion of coverage per incident through the Price-Anderson Act’s mandatory industrywide excess secondary financial protection program of risk pooling. This amount is the product of potential cumulative retrospective premium assessments of $\n138\nmillion times the current\n95\nlicensed commercial nuclear reactors in the U.S. Under this program, operating unit licensees could be assessed retrospective premiums to compensate for public nuclear liability damages in the event of a nuclear incident at any licensed facility in the U.S. Retrospective premiums may be assessed at a rate not to exceed $\n20.5\nmillion per year per licensed reactor for each incident. The assessment may be subject to state premium taxes.\nNuclear Property and Accidental Outage Coverage\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are members of Nuclear Electric Insurance Limited (NEIL), an industry mutual insurance company, which provides property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning insurance for each station for losses resulting from damage to its nuclear plants, either due to accidents or acts of terrorism. Additionally, NEIL provides accidental outage coverage for losses in the event of a major accidental outage at an insured nuclear station.\nPursuant to regulations of the NRC, each company’s property damage insurance policies provide that all proceeds from such insurance be applied, first, to place the plant in a safe and stable condition after a qualifying accident and second, to decontaminate the plant before any proceeds can be used for decommissioning, plant repair or restoration.\nLosses resulting from acts of terrorism are covered as common occurrences, such that if terrorist acts occur against one or more commercial nuclear power plants insured by NEIL within a 12-month period, they would be treated as one event and the owners of the plants where the act occurred would share one full limit of liability. The full limit of liability is currently $\n3.2\nbillion. NEIL sublimits the total aggregate for all of their policies for non-nuclear terrorist events to approximately $\n1.8\nbillion.\nEach nuclear facility has accident property damage, nuclear accident decontamination and premature decommissioning liability insurance from NEIL with limits of $\n1.5\nbillion, except for Crystal River Unit 3. Crystal River Unit 3’s limit is $\n50\nmillion and is on an actual cash value basis. All nuclear facilities except for Catawba and Crystal River Unit 3 also share an additional $\n1.25\nbillion nuclear accident insurance limit above their dedicated underlying limit. This shared additional excess limit is not subject to reinstatement in the event of a loss. Catawba has a dedicated $\n1.25\nbillion of additional nuclear accident insurance limit above its dedicated underlying limit. Catawba and Oconee also have an additional $\n750\nmillion of non-nuclear accident property damage limit. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles.\n155\nNEIL’s Accidental Outage policy provides some coverage, similar to business interruption, for losses in the event of a major accident property damage outage of a nuclear unit. Coverage is provided on a weekly limit basis after a significant waiting period deductible and at\n100\n% of the applicable weekly limits for 52 weeks and\n80\n% of the applicable weekly limits for up to the next 110 weeks. Coverage is provided until these applicable weekly periods are met, where the accidental outage policy limit will not exceed $\n490\nmillion for Catawba, $\n434\nmillion for McGuire, $\n364\nmillion for Harris, $\n336\nmillion for Brunswick, $\n322\nmillion for Oconee and $\n280\nmillion for Robinson. NEIL sublimits the accidental outage recovery up to the first 104 weeks of coverage not to exceed $\n328\nmillion from non-nuclear accidental property damage. Coverage amounts decrease in the event more than one unit at a station is out of service due to a common accident. All coverages are subject to sublimits and significant deductibles.\nPotential Retroactive Premium Assessments\nIn the event of NEIL losses, NEIL’s board of directors may assess member companies' retroactive premiums of amounts up to\n10\ntimes their annual premiums for up to\nsix years\nafter a loss. NEIL has never exercised this assessment. The maximum aggregate annual retrospective premium obligations for Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are $\n140\nmillion, $\n88\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion, respectively. Duke Energy Carolinas' maximum assessment amount includes\n100\n% of potential obligations to NEIL for jointly owned reactors. Duke Energy Carolinas would seek reimbursement from the joint owners for their portion of these assessment amounts.\nENVIRONMENTAL\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to federal, state and local laws regarding air and water quality, hazardous and solid waste disposal, coal ash and other environmental matters. These laws can be changed from time to time, imposing new obligations on the Duke Energy Registrants. The following environmental matters impact all of the Duke Energy Registrants.\nRemediation Activities\nIn addition to the ARO recorded as a result of various environmental regulations, discussed in Note 9, the Duke Energy Registrants are responsible for environmental remediation at various sites. These include certain properties that are part of ongoing operations and sites formerly owned or used by Duke Energy entities. These sites are in various stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring. Managed in conjunction with relevant federal, state and local agencies, remediation activities vary based upon site conditions and location, remediation requirements, complexity and sharing of responsibility. If remediation activities involve joint and several liability provisions, strict liability, or cost recovery or contribution actions, the Duke Energy Registrants could potentially be held responsible for environmental impacts caused by other potentially responsible parties and may also benefit from insurance policies or contractual indemnities that cover some or all cleanup costs. Liabilities are recorded when losses become probable and are reasonably estimable. The total costs that may be incurred cannot be estimated because the extent of environmental impact, allocation among potentially responsible parties, remediation alternatives and/or regulatory decisions have not yet been determined at all sites. Additional costs associated with remediation activities are likely to be incurred in the future and could be significant. Costs are typically expensed as Operation, maintenance and other in the Consolidated Statements of Operations unless regulatory recovery of the costs is deemed probable.\nThe following tables contain information regarding reserves for probable and estimable costs related to the various environmental sites. These reserves are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAdditional losses in excess of recorded reserves that could be incurred for the stages of investigation, remediation and monitoring for environmental sites that have been evaluated at this time are not material.\n156\nLITIGATION\nDuke Energy\nMichael Johnson et al. v. Duke Energy Corporation et al.\nOn September 23, 2020, plaintiff Michael Johnson, a former Duke Energy employee and participant in the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan (Plan) brought suit on his own behalf and on behalf of other participants and beneficiaries similarly situated against Duke Energy Corporation, the Duke Energy Benefits Committee, and other unnamed individual defendants. The complaint, which was subsequently amended to add a current participant as a plaintiff on November 23, 2020, alleges that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties with respect to certain fees associated with the Plan in violation of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 and seeks certification of a class of all individuals who were participants or beneficiaries of the Plan at any time on or after September 23, 2014. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ amended complaint on December 18, 2020. On January 31, 2022, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss. Duke Energy will be filing its answer to the amended complaint, following which discovery will commence. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nTexas Storm Uri Tort Litigation\nSeveral Duke Energy renewables project companies, located in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, were named in lawsuits arising out of Texas Storm Uri in mid-February 2021. Several additional suits, where Duke Energy Corporation had been named, were dismissed  The current lawsuits seek recovery for property damages, personal injury and for wrongful death allegedly caused by the power outages, which the plaintiffs claim was the result of collective failures of generators, transmission and distribution operators, retail energy providers and others including ERCOT. The cases have been consolidated into a Texas state court multidistrict litigation (MDL) proceeding for discovery purposes. With the exception of a few bellwether cases which are still being decided, all the lawsuits in the MDL will be stayed until motions to dismiss are filed and considered by the court in mid-2022. The bellwether cases will include those in which the Duke Energy entities are named. Duke Energy cannot predict the outcomes of these matters.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress\nCoal Ash Insurance Coverage Litigation\nIn March 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress filed a civil action in the North Carolina Business Court against various insurance providers. The lawsuit sought payment for coal ash related liabilities covered by third-party liability insurance policies. The insurance policies were issued between 1971 and 1986 and provide third-party liability insurance for property damage. The civil action sought damages for breach of contract and indemnification for costs arising from the Coal Ash Act and the EPA CCR rule at\n15\ncoal-fired plants in North Carolina and Sout\nh Carolina.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have now resolved claims against all of the insurers sued in this litigation and have dismissed their claims against all of the insurers.\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have received approximately $\n418\nmillion\nof coa\nl ash insurance litigation proceeds from settlements with insurer-defendants and the proceeds will be distributed in accordance with the terms of the CCR settlement agreement.\nDuke Energy Carolinas\nRuben Villano, et al. v. Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC\nOn June 16, 2021, a group of\nnine\nindividuals went over a low head dam adjacent to the Dan River Steam Station in Eden, North Carolina, while water tubing. Emergency personnel rescued\nfour\npeople and\nfive\nothers were confirmed deceased. On August 11, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas was served with the complaint filed in Durham County Superior Court on behalf of\nfour\nsurvivors, which was later amended to include all the decedents along with the survivors, except for one minor. The lawsuit alleges that Duke Energy Carolinas knew that the river was used for recreational purposes and that Duke Energy did not adequately warn about the dam. On September 30, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed its motion to dismiss and motion for transfer of venue from Durham County to Rockingham County, both of which were denied on November 15, 2021. On November 15, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas was also served with Plaintiffs Second Amended Complaint, which added the final minor plaintiff and consolidated all the actions into one lawsuit. Duke Energy Carolinas has filed its Answer and Affirmative Defenses to the Second Amended Complaint. Discovery has now commenced. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nNTE Carolinas II, LLC Litigation\nIn November 2017, Duke Energy Carolinas entered into a standard FERC large generator interconnection agreement (LGIA) with NTE Carolinas II, LLC (NTE), a company that proposed to build a combined-cycle natural gas plant in Rockingham County, North Carolina. On September 6, 2019, Duke Energy Carolinas filed a lawsuit in Mecklenburg County Superior Court against NTE for breach of contract, alleging that NTE's failure to pay benchmark payments for Duke Energy Carolinas' transmission system upgrades required under the interconnection agreement constituted a termination of the interconnection agreement. Duke Energy Carolinas is seeking a monetary judgment against NTE because NTE failed to make multiple milestone payments. The lawsuit was moved to federal court in North Carolina. NTE filed a motion to dismiss Duke Energy Carolinas’ complaint and brought counterclaims alleging anti-competitive conduct and violations of state and federal statutes. Duke Energy Carolinas filed a motion to dismiss NTE's counterclaims.\nOn May 21, 2020, in response to a NTE petition challenging Duke Energy Carolinas' termination of the LGIA, FERC issued a ruling that 1) FERC has exclusive jurisdiction to determine whether a transmission provider may terminate a LGIA; 2) FERC approval is required to terminate a conforming LGIA if objected to by the interconnection customer; and 3) Duke Energy may not announce the termination of a conforming LGIA unless FERC has approved the termination. FERC's Office of Enforcement also initiated an investigation of Duke Energy Carolinas into matters pertaining to the LGIA. Duke Energy Carolinas is cooperating with the Office of Enforcement and cannot predict the outcome of this investigation.\n157\nOn August 17, 2020, the court denied both NTE’s and Duke Energy Carolinas’ motions to dismiss. In October 2021, NTE filed a Second Amended Counterclaim and Complaint, and in January 2022, NTE filed a Third Amended Counterclaim and Complaint. Duke Energy Carolinas has responded to these pleadings. On December 6, 2021, Duke Energy Carolinas filed an Amended Complaint. Discovery is scheduled to end by April 2022, after which the parties will file dispositive motions for the court's consideration. The case is scheduled to be trial ready by August 1, 2022. Duke Energy Carolinas cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nAsbestos-related Injuries and Damages Claims\nDuke Energy Carolinas has experienced numerous claims for indemnification and medical cost reimbursement related to asbestos exposure. These claims relate to damages for bodily injuries alleged to have arisen from exposure to or use of asbestos in connection with construction and maintenance activities conducted on its electric generation plants prior to 1985.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has recognized asbestos-related reserves of $\n501\nmillion and $\n572\nmillion at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These reserves are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The change in the reserves is a result of a third-party study completed in 2021 as well as settlements made throughout the year. These reserves are based upon Duke Energy Carolinas' best estimate for current and future asbestos claims through 2041 and are recorded on an undiscounted basis. In light of the uncertainties inherent in a longer-term forecast, management does not believe they can reasonably estimate the indemnity and medical costs that might be incurred after 2041 related to such potential claims. It is possible Duke Energy Carolinas may incur asbestos liabilities in excess of the recorded reserves.\nDuke Energy Carolinas has third-party insurance to cover certain losses related to asbestos-related injuries and damages above an aggregate self-insured retention. Receivables for insurance recoveries were $\n644\nmillion and $\n704\nmillion at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These amounts are classified in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets and Receivables within Current Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any future payments up to the policy limit will be reimbursed by the third-party insurance carrier. Duke Energy Carolinas is not aware of any uncertainties regarding the legal sufficiency of insurance claims. Duke Energy Carolinas believes the insurance recovery asset is probable of recovery as the insurance carrier continues to have a strong financial strength rating.\nAs described in Note 1, Duke Energy adopted the new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year reported results. The reserve for credit losses for insurance receivables for the asbestos-related injuries and damages based on adoption of the new standard is $\n12\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion for Duke Energy and Duke Energy Carolinas as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The insurance receivable is evaluated based on the risk of default and the historical losses, current conditions and expected conditions around collectability. Management evaluates the risk of default annually based on payment history, credit rating and changes in the risk of default from credit agencies.\nDuke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida\nSpent Nuclear Fuel Matters\nOn June 18, 2018, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida sued the U.S. in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims for damages incurred for the period 2014 through 2018. The lawsuit claimed the Department of Energy breached a contract in failing to accept spent nuclear fuel under the Nuclear Waste Policy Act of 1982 and asserted damages for the cost of on-site storage in the amount of $\n100\nmillion and $\n200\nmillion for Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. The Department of Energy filed a motion for partial summary judgment relating to approximately $\n60\nmillion of Duke Energy Florida’s claimed damages. A hearing on the motion was held on February 9, 2022. Trial is scheduled for April 2022. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nDuke Energy Florida\nPower Purchase Dispute Arbitration\nDuke Energy Florida, on behalf of its customers, entered into a PPA for the purchase of firm capacity and energy from a qualifying facility under the Public Utilities Regulatory Policies Act of 1978. Duke Energy Florida determined the qualifying facility did not perform in accordance with the PPA, and Duke Energy Florida terminated the PPA. The qualifying facility counterparty filed a confidential American Arbitration Association (AAA) arbitration demand, challenging the termination of the PPA and seeking damages.\nThe final arbitration hearing occurred during the week of December 7, 202\n0. An interim arbitral award was issued in March 2021, upholding Duke Energy Florida's positions on all issues and awarding the company termination costs. In May 2021, the final arbitral award was issued awarding Duke Energy Florida its claimed fees and costs. O\nn August 18, 2021,\nDuke Energy Florida filed a motion in Florida state court to confirm the arbitral award. On December 13, 2021, the court entered a final judgment confirming the arbitration award.\nDuke Energy Indiana\nCoal Ash Basin Closure Plan Appeal\nOn January 27, 2020, Hoosier Environmental Council (HEC) filed a Petition for Administrative Review with the Indiana Office of Environmental Adjudication challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s (IDEM's) December 10, 2019 partial approval of Duke Energy Indiana’s ash pond closure plan at Gallagher. After hearing oral arguments in early April 2021 on Duke Energy Indiana's and HEC's competing Motions for Summary Judgment, on May 4, 2021, the administrative court rejected all of HEC’s claims and issued a ruling in favor of Duke Energy Indiana. On June 3, 2021, HEC filed an appeal in Superior Court to seek judicial review of the order\n.\nOn June 25, 2021, Duke Energy Indiana filed its response to the Petition to Review. On August 30, 2021, HEC served Duke Energy Indiana with its Brief in Support of Petition for Judicial Review. On October 29, 2021, Duke Energy Indiana and IDEM filed their response briefs. On December 13, 2021, HEC filed and served its Reply Brief.\nOn January 11, 2022, Duke Energy Indiana received a compliance obligation letter from the EPA notifying the company that the two basins at issue in the litigation are subject to requirements of the CCR Rule. The letter does not provide a deadline for compliance. Duke Energy Indiana is evaluating the EPA letter, its potential impacts on the litigation and the extent to which this letter could apply to CCR surface impoundments at its other Indiana sites.\n158\nFollowing the January 11, 2022 EPA notice of compliance letter, the parties filed a joint motion to stay the litigation for 45 days, which was approved by the court. As a result, the oral argument scheduled for February 1, 2022, was postponed until the end of the 45-day stay. Duke Energy Indiana cannot predict the outcome of this matter.\nOther Litigation and Legal Proceedings\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are involved in other legal, tax and regulatory proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business, some of which involve significant amounts. The Duke Energy Registrants believe the final disposition of these proceedings will not have a material effect on their results of operations, cash flows or financial position for the years presented. Reserves are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheets in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities and Other within Current Liabilities.\nOTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nGeneral\nAs part of their normal business, the Duke Energy Registrants are party to various financial guarantees, performance guarantees and other contractual commitments to extend guarantees of credit and other assistance to various subsidiaries, investees and other third parties. These guarantees involve elements of performance and credit risk, which are not fully recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheets and have uncapped maximum potential payments. See Note 7 for more information.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchased Power\nDuke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Ohio have ongoing purchased power contracts, including renewable energy contracts, with other utilities, wholesale marketers, co-generators and qualified facilities. These purchased power contracts generally provide for capacity and energy payments. In addition, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have various contracts to secure transmission\nrights.\nThe following table presents executory purchased power contracts with terms exceeding one year, excluding contracts classified as leases.\n(a)    Contracts represent between\n18\n% and\n100\n% of net plant output.\n(b)    Contracts represent\n100\n% of net plant output.\n(c)    Contracts represent\n15\n% of net plant output.\n(d)    Excludes PPA with OVEC. See Note 17 for additional information.\nGas Supply and Capacity Contracts\nDuke Energy Ohio and Piedmont routinely enter into long-term natural gas supply commodity and capacity commitments and other agreements that commit future cash flows to acquire services needed in their businesses. These commitments include pipeline and storage capacity contracts and natural gas supply contracts to provide service to customers. Costs arising from the natural gas supply commodity and capacity commitments, while significant, are pass-through costs to customers and are generally fully recoverable through the fuel adjustment or PGA pro\ncedures and prudence reviews in North Carolina and South Carolina and under the Tennessee Incentive Plan in Tennessee. In the Midwest, these costs are recovered via the Gas Cost Recovery Rate in Ohio or the Gas Cost Adjustment Clause in Kentucky. The time periods for fixed payments under pipeline and storage capacity contracts are up to\n14\nyears. The time periods for fixed payments under natural gas supply contracts are up to\nfive years\n. The time period for the natural gas supply purchase commitments is up to\n10\nyears.\nCertai\nn storage and pipeline capacity contracts require the payment of demand charges that are based on rates approved by the FERC in order to maintain rights to access the natural gas storage or pipeline capacity on a firm basis during the contract term. The demand charges that are incurred in each period are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income as part of natural gas purchases and are included in Cost of natural gas.\nThe following table presents future unconditional purchase obligations under natural gas supply and capacity contracts as of December 31, 2021.\n5.\nLEASES\nAs part of its operations, Duke Energy leases certain aircraft, space on communication towers, industrial equipment, fleet vehicles, fuel transportation (barges and railcars), land and office space under various terms and expiration dates. Additionally, Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Indiana have finance leases related to firm natural gas pipeline transportation capacity. Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida have entered into certain PPAs, which are classified as finance and operating leases.\n159\nDuke Energy has certain lease agreements, which include variable lease payments that are based on the usage of an asset. These variable lease payments\nare not included in the measurement of the ROU assets or operating lease liabilities on the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCertain Duke Energy lease agreements include options for renewal and early termination. The intent to renew a lease varies depending on the lease type and asset. Renewal options that are reasonably certain to be exercised are included in the lease measurements. The decision to terminate a lease early is dependent on various economic factors. No termination options have been included in any of the lease measurements.\nDuke Energy Carolinas entered into a sale-leaseback arrangement in December 2019, to construct and occupy an office tower. The lease agreement was evaluated as a sale-leaseback of real estate and it was determined that the transaction did not qualify for sale-leaseback accounting. As a result, the transaction is being accounted for as a financing. For this transaction, Duke Energy Carolinas will continue to record the real estate on the Consolidated Balance Sheets within Property, Plant and Equipment as if it were the legal owner and will continue to recognize depreciation expense over the estimated useful life. In addition, the failed sale-leaseback obligation is reported within Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, with the monthly lease payments commencing after the construction phase being split between interest expense and principal pay down of the debt.\nDuke Energy operates various renewable energy projects and sells the generated output to utilities, electric cooperatives, municipalities and commercial and industrial customers through long-term PPAs. In certain situations, these PPAs and the associated renewable energy projects qualify as operating leases. Rental income from these leases is accounted for as Nonregulated electric and other revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. There are no minimum lease payments as all payments are contingent based on actual electricity generated by the renewable energy projects. Contingent lease payments were $\n259\nmillion, $\n275\nmillion and $\n264\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. Renewable energy projects owned by Duke Energy and accounted for as operating leases had a cost basis of $\n3,339\nmillion and $\n3,335\nmillion and accumulated depreciation of $\n966\nmillion and $\n848\nmillion at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These assets are principally classified as nonregulated electric generation and transmission assets.\nPiedmont has certain agreements with Duke Energy Carolinas for the construction and transportation of natural gas pipelines to supply its natural gas plant needs. Piedmont accounts for these pipeline lateral contracts as sales-type leases since the present value of the sum of the lease payments equals the fair value of the assets. These pipeline lateral assets owned by Piedmont had a current net investment basis of $\n2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, and a long-term net investment basis of $\n203\nmillion and $\n205\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. These assets are classified in Other, within Current Assets and Other Noncurrent Assets, respectively, on Piedmont's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Duke Energy Carolinas accounts for the contracts as finance leases.

The weighted average days to maturity for Duke Energy's commercial paper program was\n15\ndays.\n(e)\nDuke Energy includes $\n1,121\nmillion and $\n100\nmillion in purchase accounting adjustments related to Progress Energy and Piedmont, respectively.\n(f)\nDuke Energy includes $\n29\nmillion in purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to the merger with Progress Energy.\n(g)\nRefer to Note 17 for additional information on amounts from consolidated VIEs.\n164\n(a)    Substantially all electric utility property is mortgaged under mortgage bond indentures.\n(b)    Duke Energy includes $\n24\nmillion and $\n341\nmillion of finance lease purchase accounting adjustments related to Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively, related to PPAs that are not accounted for as finance leases in their respective financial statements because of grandfathering provisions in GAAP.\n(c)    Substantially all tax-exempt bonds are secured by first mortgage bonds, letters of credit or the Master Credit Facility.\n(d)    Includes $\n625\nmillion that was classified as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to the existence of long-term credit facilities that backstop these commercial paper balances, along with Duke Energy’s ability and intent to refinance these balances on a long-term basis. The weighted average days to maturity for Duke Energy's commercial paper programs was\n23\ndays.\n(e)    Duke Energy includes $\n1,196\nmillion and $\n117\nmillion in purchase accounting adjustments related to Progress Energy and Piedmont, respectively.\n(f)    Duke Energy includes $\n33\nmillion in purchase accounting adjustments primarily related to the merger with Progress Energy.\n(g)     Refer to Note 17 for additional information on amounts from consolidated VIEs.\nCurrent Maturities of Long-Term Debt\nThe following table shows the significant components of Current maturities of Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Duke Energy Registrants currently anticipate satisfying these obligations with cash on hand and proceeds from additional borrowings.\n(a)    In December 2021, Duke Energy Progress early retired $\n700\nmillion of unsecured debt with an original maturity date of February 2022.\n(b)    Debt has a floating interest rate.\n(c)    Includes finance lease obligations, amortizing debt and small bullet maturities.\n165\nMaturities and Call Options\nThe following table shows the annual maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter. Amounts presented exclude short-term notes payable, commercial paper and money pool borrowings and debt issuance costs for the Subsidiary Registrants.\n(a)    Excludes $\n1,250\nmillion in purchase accounting adjustments related to the Progress Energy merger and the Piedmont acquisition.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants have the ability under certain debt facilities to call and repay the obligation prior to its scheduled maturity. Therefore, the actual timing of future cash repayments could be materially different than as presented above.\nShort-Term Obligations Classified as Long-Term Debt\nTax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder and certain commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings are classified as Long-Term Debt on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These tax-exempt bonds, commercial paper issuances and money pool borrowings, which are short-term obligations by nature, are classified as long-term due to Duke Energy’s intent and ability to utilize such borrowings as long-term financing. As Duke Energy’s Master Credit Facility and other bilateral letter of credit agreements have non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of the balance sheet date, Duke Energy has the ability to refinance these short-term obligations on a long-term basis.\nThe following tables show short-term obligations classified as long-term debt.\n(a)    Progress Energy amounts are equal to Duke Energy Progress amounts.\n166\nSummary of Significant Debt Issuances\nThe following tables summarize significant debt issuances (in millions).\n(a)\nDebt issued to repay at maturity $\n160\nmillion senior unsecured notes due June 2021, pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(b)\nDebt has a floating interest rate.\n(c)\nDebt issued to repay $\n1.75\nbillion of Duke Energy (Parent) debt maturities, to repay a portion of short-term debt and for general corporate purposes.\n(d)\nDebt issued to repay in October 2021 $\n500\nmillion of Duke Energy (Parent) unsecured notes.

The Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, have borrowing capacity under the Master Credit Facility up to a specified sublimit for each borrower. Duke Energy has the unilateral ability at any time to increase or decrease the borrowing sublimits of each borrower, subject to a maximum sublimit for each borrower. The amount available under the Master Credit Facility has been reduced to backstop issuances of commercial paper, certain letters of credit and variable-rate demand tax-exempt bonds that may be put to the Duke Energy Registrants at the option of the holder.\nThe table below includes the current borrowing sublimits and available capacity under these credit facilities.\n(a)    Represents the sublimit of each borrower.\n(b)    Duke Energy issued $\n625\nmillion of commercial paper and loaned the proceeds through the money pool to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. The balances are classified as Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n168\nThree-Year\nRevolving Credit Facility\nDuke Energy (Parent) has a $\n1\nbillion revolving credit facility. In March 2021, Duke Energy extended the termination date of the facility from May 2022 to May 2024. Borrowings under this facility will be used for general corporate purposes. As of December 31, 2021, $\n500\nmillion has been drawn under this facility. This balance is classified as Long-term debt on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets. Any undrawn commitments can be drawn, and borrowings can be prepaid, at any time throughout the term of the facility. During the first quarter of 2020, an additional $\n500\nmillion was drawn under this facility to manage liquidity impacts from COVID-19. The additional $\n500\nmillion was paid down during the second quarter of 2020. The terms and conditions of the facility are generally consistent with those governing Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility.\nDuke Energy Ohio Term Loan Facility\nIn October 2021, Duke Energy Ohio entered into a\ntwo-year\nterm loan facility with commitments totaling $\n100\nmillion. Borrowings under the facility will be used to pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. The term loan was fully drawn at the time of closing in October. The balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy Ohio’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuke Energy Indiana Term Loan Facility\nIn October 2021, Duke Energy Indiana entered into a\ntwo-year\nterm loan facility with commitments totaling $\n300\nmillion. Borrowings under the facility will be used to pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. The term loan was fully drawn at the time of closing in October. The balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy Indiana’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDuke Energy Kentucky Term Loan Facility\nIn October 2021, Duke Energy Kentucky entered into a\ntwo-year\nterm loan facility with commitments totaling $\n50\nmillion. Borrowings under the facility will be used to pay down short-term debt and for general corporate purposes. The term loan was fully drawn at the time of closing in October. The balance is classified as Long-Term Debt on Duke Energy Ohio’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Debt Matters\nIn September 2019, Duke Energy filed a Form S-3 with the SEC. Under this Form S-3, which is uncapped, the Duke Energy Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, may issue debt and other securities, including preferred stock, in the future at amounts, prices and with terms to be determined at the time of future offerings. The registration statement was filed to replace a similar prior filing upon expiration of its three-year term and also allows for the issuance of common and preferred stock by Duke Energy.\nDuke Energy has an effective Form S-3 with the SEC to sell up to $\n3\nbillion of variable denomination floating-rate demand notes, called PremierNotes. The Form S-3 states that no more than $\n1.5\nbillion of the notes will be outstanding at any particular time. The notes are offered on a continuous basis and bear interest at a floating rate per annum determined by the Duke Energy PremierNotes Committee, or its designee, on a weekly basis. The interest rate payable on notes held by an investor may vary based on the principal amount of the investment. The notes have no stated maturity date, are non-transferable and may be redeemed in whole or in part by Duke Energy or at the investor’s option at any time. The balance as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, was $\n1,066\nmillion and $\n1,168\nmillion, respectively. The notes are short-term debt obligations of Duke Energy and are reflected as Notes payable and commercial paper on Duke Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMoney Pool and Intercompany Credit Agreements\nThe Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, are eligible to receive support for their short-term borrowing needs through participation with Duke Energy and certain of its subsidiaries in a money pool arrangement. Under this arrangement, those companies with short-term funds may provide short-term loans to affiliates participating in this arrangement. The money pool is structured such that the Subsidiary Registrants, excluding Progress Energy, separately manage their cash needs and working capital requirements. Accordingly, there is no net settlement of receivables and payables between money pool participants. Duke Energy (Parent), may loan funds to its participating subsidiaries, but may not borrow funds through the money pool. Accordingly, as the money pool activity is between Duke Energy and its wholly owned subsidiaries, all money pool balances are eliminated within Duke Energy’s Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nMoney pool receivable balances are reflected within Notes receivable from affiliated companies on the Subsidiary Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets. Money pool payable balances are reflected within either Notes payable to affiliated companies or Long-Term Debt Payable to Affiliated Companies on the Subsidiary Registrants’ Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nProgress Energy has a revolving credit agreement with Duke Energy (Parent) which allows up to $\n2.5\nbillion in intercompany borrowings. The balance is reflected within Notes payable to affiliated companies on the Progress Energy Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRestrictive Debt Covenants\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ debt and credit agreements contain various financial and other covenants. Duke Energy's Master Credit Facility contains a covenant requiring the debt-to-total capitalization ratio not to exceed\n65\n% for each borrower, excluding Piedmont, and\n70\n% for Piedmont. Failure to meet those covenants beyond applicable grace periods could result in accelerated due dates and/or termination of the agreements. As of December 31, 2021, each of the Duke Energy Registrants was in compliance with all covenants related to their debt agreements. In addition, some credit agreements may allow for acceleration of payments or termination of the agreements due to nonpayment, or acceleration of other significant indebtedness of the borrower or some of its subsidiaries. None of the debt or credit agreements contain material adverse change clauses.\nOther Loans\nAs of December 31, 2021, and 2020, Duke Energy had loans outstanding of $\n819\nmillion, including $\n34\nmillion at Duke Energy Progress and $\n817\nmillion, including $\n35\nmillion at Duke Energy Progress, respectively, against the cash surrender value of life insurance policies it owns on the lives of its executives. The amounts outstanding were carried as a reduction of the related cash surrender value that is included in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n169\n7.\nGUARANTEES AND INDEMNIFICATIONS\nDuke Energy has various financial and performance guarantees and indemnifications with non-consolidated entities, which are issued in the normal course of business. As discussed below, these contracts include performance guarantees, standby letters of credit, debt guarantees and indemnifications. Duke Energy enters into these arrangements to facilitate commercial transactions with third parties by enhancing the value of the transaction to the third party. At December 31, 2021, Duke Energy does not believe conditions are likely for significant performance under these guarantees. To the extent liabilities are incurred as a result of the activities covered by the guarantees, such liabilities are included on the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOn January 2, 2007, Duke Energy completed the spin-off of its previously wholly owned natural gas businesses to shareholders. Guarantees issued by Duke Energy or its affiliates, or assigned to Duke Energy prior to the spin-off, remained with Duke Energy subsequent to the spin-off. Guarantees issued by Spectra Energy Capital, LLC (Spectra Capital) or its affiliates prior to the spin-off remained with Spectra Capital subsequent to the spin-off, except for guarantees that were later assigned to Duke Energy. Duke Energy has indemnified Spectra Capital against any losses incurred under certain of the guarantee obligations that remain with Spectra Capital. At December 31, 2021, the maximum potential amount of future payments associated with these guarantees were $\n48\nmillion, the majority of which expire by 2028.\nIn October 2017, ACP executed a $\n3.4\nbillion revolving credit facility with a stated maturity date of October 2021. Duke Energy entered into a guarantee agreement to support its share of the ACP revolving credit facility. In July 2020, ACP reduced the size of the credit facility to $\n1.9\nbillion. Duke Energy's maximum exposure to loss under the terms of the guarantee was $\n860\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. This amount represented\n47\n% of the outstanding borrowings under the credit facility and was recognized within Other Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2020, of which $\n95\nmillion was previously recognized due the adoption of new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $\n855\nmillion to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. See Notes 3 and 12 for more information.\nIn addition to the Spectra Capital and ACP revolving credit facility guarantees above, Duke Energy has issued performance guarantees to customers and other third parties that guarantee the payment and performance of other parties, including certain non-wholly owned entities, as well as guarantees of debt of certain non-consolidated entities. If such entities were to default on payments or performance, Duke Energy would be required under the guarantees to make payments on the obligations of these entities. The maximum potential amount of future payments required under these guarantees as of December 31, 2021, was $\n53\nmillion of which all expire between 2022 and 2030, with the remaining performance guarantees having no contractual expiration. Additionally, certain guarantees have uncapped maximum potential payments; however, Duke Energy does not believe these guarantees will have a material effect on its results of operations, cash flows or financial position.\nDuke Energy uses bank-issued standby letters of credit to secure the performance of wholly owned and non-wholly owned entities to a third party or customer. Under these arrangements, Duke Energy has payment obligations to the issuing bank that are triggered by a draw by the third party or customer due to the failure of the wholly owned or non-wholly owned entity to perform according to the terms of its underlying contract. At December 31, 2021, Duke Energy had issued a total of $\n586\nmillion in letters of credit, which expire between 2022 and 2023. The unused amount under these letters of credit was $\n54\nmillion.\nDuke Energy recognized $\n3\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, primarily in Other within Other Noncurrent Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, for the guarantees discussed above. As current estimates change, additional losses related to guarantees and indemnifications to third parties, which could be material, may be recorded by the Duke Energy Registrants in the future.\n8.\nJOINT OWNERSHIP OF GENERATING AND TRANSMISSION FACILITIES\nThe Duke Energy Registrants maintain ownership interests in certain jointly owned generating and transmission facilities. The Duke Energy Registrants are entitled to a share of the generating capacity and output of each unit equal to their respective ownership interests. The Duke Energy Registrants pay their ownership share of additional construction costs, fuel inventory purchases and operating expenses. The Duke Energy Registrants share of revenues and operating costs of the jointly owned facilities is included within the corresponding line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Each participant in the jointly owned facilities must provide its own financing.\nThe following table presents the Duke Energy Registrants' interest of jointly owned plant or facilities and amounts included on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. All facilities are operated by the Duke Energy Registrants and are included in the Electric Utilities and Infrastructure segment.\n(a)    Jointly owned with North Carolina Municipal Power Agency Number 1, NCEMC and PMPA.\n(b)    Jointly owned with NCEMC.\n(c)    Jointly owned with WVPA and IMPA.\n(d)    Jointly owned with WVPA.\n170\n9.\nASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS\nDuke Energy records an ARO when it has a legal obligation to incur retirement costs associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the obligation can be reasonably estimated. Certain assets of the Duke Energy Registrants have an indeterminate life, such as transmission and distribution facilities, and thus the fair value of the retirement obligation is not reasonably estimable. A liability for these AROs will be recorded when a fair value is determinable.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ regulated operations accrue costs of removal for property that does not have an associated legal retirement obligation based on regulatory orders from state commissions. These costs of removal are recorded as a regulatory liability in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment. The Duke Energy Registrants do not accrue the estimated cost of removal for any nonregulated assets. See Note 3 for the estimated cost of removal for assets without an associated legal retirement obligation, which are included in Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table presents the AROs recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(a)    Duke Energy amount includes purchase accounting adjustments related to the merger with Progress Energy.\nNuclear Decommissioning Liability\nAROs related to nuclear decommissioning are based on site-specific cost studies. The NCUC, PSCSC and FPSC require updated cost estimates for decommissioning nuclear plants every five years.\nThe following table summarizes information about the most recent site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost studies. Decommissioning costs are stated in 2018 or 2019 dollars, depending on the year of the cost study, and include costs to decommission plant components not subject to radioactive contamination.\n(a)    Amount represents annual funding requirement for the current fiscal year. Amounts for Progress Energy equal the sum of Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida.\n(b)    Decommissioning costs for Duke Energy Carolinas reflects its ownership interest in jointly owned reactors. Other joint owners are responsible for decommissioning costs related to their interest in the reactors.\n(c)    Duke Energy Carolinas' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2018 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019. A new funding study was also completed and filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in 2019.\n(d)    Duke Energy Progress' site-specific nuclear decommissioning cost study completed in 2019 was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in March 2020. Duke Energy Progress also completed a funding study, which was filed with the NCUC and PSCSC in July 2020. In October 2021, Duke Energy Progress filed the 2019 nuclear decommissioning cost study with the FERC, as well as a revised rate schedule for decommissioning expense to be collected from wholesale customers. The FERC accepted the filing, as filed on December 9, 2021.\n(e)    During 2019, Duke Energy Florida reached an agreement to transfer decommissioning work for Crystal River Unit 3 to a third party and decommissioning costs are based on the agreement with this third party rather than a cost study. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively.\nNuclear Decommissioning Trust Funds\nDuke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida each maintain NDTFs that are intended to pay for the decommissioning costs of their respective nuclear power plants. The NDTF investments are managed and invested in accordance with applicable requirements of various regulatory bodies including the NRC, FERC, NCUC, PSCSC, FPSC and the IRS.\nUse of the NDTF investments is restricted to nuclear decommissioning activities including license termination, spent fuel and site restoration. The license termination and spent fuel obligations relate to contaminated decommissioning and are recorded as AROs. The site restoration obligation relates to non-contaminated decommissioning and is recorded to cost of removal within Regulatory liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n171\nThe following table presents the fair value of NDTF assets legally restricted for purposes of settling AROs associated with nuclear decommissioning. Duke Energy Florida entered into an agreement with a third party to decommission Crystal River Unit 3 and was granted an exemption from the NRC, which allows for use of the NDTF for all aspects of nuclear decommissioning. The entire balance of Duke Energy Florida's NDTF may be applied toward license termination, spent fuel and site restoration costs incurred to decommission Crystal River Unit 3 and is excluded from the table below. See Note 16 for additional information related to the fair value of the Duke Energy Registrants' NDTFs.\nNuclear Operating Licenses\nAs described in Note 3, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress intend to seek renewal of operating licenses and\n20\n-year license extensions for all of their nuclear stations.\nThe following table includes the current expiration of nuclear operating licenses.\nThe NRC has acknowledged permanent cessation of operation and permanent removal of fuel from the reactor vessel at Crystal River Unit 3. Therefore, the license no longer authorizes operation of the reactor. During 2019, Duke Energy Florida entered into an agreement for the accelerated decommissioning of Crystal River Unit 3. Regulatory approval was received from the NRC and the FPSC in April 2020 and August 2020, respectively. See Note 3 for more information.\nClosure of Ash Impoundments\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are subject to state and federal regulations covering the closure of coal ash impoundments, including the EPA CCR rule and the Coal Ash Act, and other agreements. AROs recorded on the Duke Energy Registrants' Consolidated Balance Sheets include the legal obligation for closure of coal ash basins and the disposal of related ash as a result of these regulations and agreements.\nThe ARO amount recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheets is based upon estimated closure costs for impacted ash impoundments. The amount recorded represents the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs based upon specific closure plans. Actual costs to be incurred will be dependent upon factors that vary from site to site. The most significant factors are the method and time frame of closure at the individual sites. Closure methods considered include removing the water from ash basins, consolidating material as necessary and capping the ash with a synthetic barrier, excavating and relocating the ash to a lined structural fill or lined landfill or recycling the ash for concrete or some other beneficial use. The ultimate method and timetable for closure will be in compliance with standards set by federal and state regulations and other agreements. The ARO amount will be adjusted as additional information is gained through the closure and post-closure process, including acceptance and approval of compliance approaches, which may change management assumptions, and may result in a material change to the balance. See ARO Liability Rollforward section below for information on revisions made to the coal ash liability during 2021 and 2020.\nAsset retirement costs associated with the AROs for operating plants and retired plants are included in Net property, plant and equipment and Regulatory assets, respectively, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. See Note 3 for additional information on Regulatory assets related to AROs and Note 4 for additional information on commitments and contingencies.\nCost recovery for future expenditures will be pursued through the normal ratemaking process with federal and state utility commissions, which permit recovery of necessary and prudently incurred costs associated with Duke Energy’s regulated operations. See Note 3 for additional information on recovery of coal ash costs.\n172\nARO Liability Rollforward\nThe following tables present changes in the liability associated with AROs.\n(a)    Substantially all accretion expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, relates to Duke Energy’s regulated operations and has been deferred in accordance with regulatory accounting treatment.\n(b)    Amounts primarily relate to ash impoundment closures and nuclear decommissioning.\n(c)    Primarily relates to decreases due to revised basin closure cost estimates, partially offset by increases related to new closure plan approvals, post closure maintenance and beneficiation costs. Duke Energy Indiana estimates also include the impacts of closure estimates for certain ash impoundments due to the impact of Hoosier Environmental Council’s petition filed with the court challenging the Indiana Department of Environmental Management’s partial approval of Duke Energy Indiana’s ash pond closure plan. See Note 4 for more information on Hoosier Environmental Council's petition. The amounts recorded represent the discounted cash flows for estimated closure costs based upon the probability weightings of the potential closure methods as evaluated on a site-by-site basis.\n173\n10.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nThe following tables summarize the property, plant and equipment for Duke Energy and its subsidiary registrants.\n(a)    Includes finance leases of $\n958\nmillion, $\n335\nmillion, $\n729\nmillion, $\n627\nmillion, $\n102\nmillion and $\n10\nmillion at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, primarily within Plant – Regulated. The Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida amounts are net of $\n178\nmillion, $\n45\nmillion and $\n133\nmillion, respectively, of accumulated amortization of finance leases.\n(b)    Includes $\n1,799\nmillion, $\n1,064\nmillion, $\n735\nmillion and $\n735\nmillion of accumulated amortization of nuclear fuel at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n(c)    Includes accumulated amortization of finance leases of $\n9\nmillion, $\n33\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion at Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively.\n(d)    Includes accumulated amortization of finance leases of ($\n1\nmillion) at Duke Energy.\n(e)    Includes gross property, plant and equipment cost of consolidated VIEs of $\n7,339\nmillion and accumulated depreciation of consolidated VIEs of $\n1,474\nmillion at Duke Energy.\nDuke Energy continues to execute on its business transformation strategy, including the evaluation of in-office work policies considering the experience with the COVID-19 pandemic and also workforce realignment of roles and responsibilities. In May 2021, Duke Energy management approved the sale of certain properties and entered into an agreement to exit certain leased space on December 31, 2021. The sale of the properties is subject to abandonment accounting and resulted in an impairment charge. Additionally, the exit of the leased space resulted in the impairment of related furniture, fixtures and equipment. During the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, Duke Energy recorded a pretax charge to earnings of $\n192\nmillion on the Consolidated Statements of Operations, which includes $\n133\nmillion within Impairment of assets and other charges, $\n42\nmillion within Operations, maintenance and other and $\n17\nmillion within Depreciation and amortization.\nIn 2021, Duke Energy continued to monitor recoverability of its renewable merchant plants located in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas West market and in the PJM West market due to fluctuating market pricing and long-term forecasted energy prices. The assets were not impaired as of December 31, 2021, because the carrying value of approximately $\n200\nmillion continues to approximate the aggregate estimated future undiscounted cash flows. A continued decline in energy market pricing or other factors unfavorably impacting the economics would likely result in a future impairment.

In 2020, Duke Energy determined it would no longer continue its investment in the construction of the ACP pipeline. See Notes 3 and 7 for further information.\nStorage Facilities\nPiedmont owns a\n45\n% interest in Pine Needle, an interstate LNG storage facility located in North Carolina, and a\n50\n% interest in Hardy Storage, an underground interstate natural gas storage facility located in West Virginia.\nRenewable Natural Gas Investments\nDuke Energy owns a\n29.68\n% investment in SustainRNG, a developer of renewable natural gas projects, and a\n70\n% interest in Sustain T&W, SustainRNG's renewable natural gas project located in Georgia.\nCommercial Renewables\nDS Cornerstone, LLC, which owns wind farm projects in the U.S. was part of a sale of minority interest in a certain portion of renewable assets in 2019. See Note 1 for more information on the sale. Prior to the sale, Duke Energy had a\n50\n% interest in DS Cornerstone, LLC. Subsequent to the sale, Duke Energy has a\n26\n% interest in the investment.\nIn 2020, Duke Energy completed its acquisition of\n70\ndistributed fuel cell projects from Bloom Energy Corporation, which approximates\n43\nMW of capacity serving commercial and industrial customers across the U.S. Duke Energy is not the primary beneficiary of the distributed fuel cell portfolio and does not consolidate these assets.\nOther\nDuke Energy has a\n17.5\n% indirect economic ownership interest and a\n25\n% board representation and voting rights interest in NMC, which owns and operates a methanol and MTBE business in Jubail, Saudi Arabia.\nSignificant Subsidiaries\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, Duke Energy's investment in ACP met the requirements of S-X Rule 4-08(g) to provide summarized financial information. The following table provides summary information for ACP as required under S-X Rule 1-02(bb) for the period of significance and comparative prior year periods in Duke Energy's consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended December 31, 2021, there were no investments that met the significance requirements.\n178\n13.\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nThe Subsidiary Registrants engage in related party transactions in accordance with the applicable state and federal commission regulations. Refer to the Consolidated Balance Sheets of the Subsidiary Registrants for balances due to or due from related parties.\nMaterial amounts related to transactions with related parties included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income are presented in the following table.\n(a)\nThe Subsidiary Registrants are charged their proportionate share of corporate governance and other shared services costs, primarily related to human resources, employee benefits, information technology, legal and accounting fees, as well as other third-party costs. These amounts are primarily recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(b)\nThe Subsidiary Registrants incur expenses related to certain indemnification coverages through Bison, Duke Energy’s wholly owned captive insurance subsidiary. These expenses are recorded in Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(c)\nDuke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress participate in a JDA, which allows the collective dispatch of power plants between the service territories to reduce customer rates. Revenues from the sale of power and expenses from the purchase of power pursuant to the JDA are recorded in Operating Revenues and Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power, respectively, on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n(d)\nPiedmont provides long-term natural gas delivery service to certain Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress natural gas-fired generation facilities. Piedmont records the sales in Operating Revenues, and Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress record the related purchases as a component of Fuel used in electric generation and purchased power on their respective Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. These intercompany revenues and expenses are eliminated in consolidation.\n(e)\nPiedmont has related party transactions as a customer of its equity method investments in Pine Needle, Hardy Storage, and Cardinal natural gas storage and transportation facilities. These expenses are included in Cost of natural gas on Piedmont's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n179\nIn addition to the amounts presented above, the Subsidiary Registrants have other affiliate transactions, including rental of office space, participation in a money pool arrangement, other operational transactions and their proportionate share of certain charged expenses. See Note 6 for more information regarding money pool. These transactions of the Subsidiary Registrants are incurred in the ordinary course of business and are eliminated in consolidation.\nAs discussed in Note 17, certain trade receivables have been sold by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana to CRC, an affiliate formed by a subsidiary of Duke Energy. The proceeds obtained from the sales of receivables are largely cash but do include a subordinated note from CRC for a portion of the purchase price.\nIntercompany Income Taxes\nDuke Energy and the Subsidiary Registrants file a consolidated federal income tax return and other state and jurisdictional returns. The Subsidiary Registrants have a tax sharing agreement with Duke Energy for the allocation of consolidated tax liabilities and benefits. Income taxes recorded represent amounts the Subsidiary Registrants would incur as separate C-Corporations.\nThe following table includes the balance of intercompany income tax receivables and payables for the Subsidiary Registrants.\n14.\nDERIVATIVES AND HEDGING\nThe Duke Energy Registrants use commodity and interest rate contracts to manage commodity price risk and interest rate risk. The primary use of commodity derivatives is to hedge the generation portfolio against changes in the prices of electricity and natural gas. Piedmont enters into natural gas supply contracts to provide diversification, reliability and natural gas cost benefits to its customers. Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk associated with borrowings.\nAll derivative instruments not identified as NPNS are recorded at fair value as assets or liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cash collateral related to derivative instruments executed under master netting arrangements is offset against the collateralized derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The cash impacts of settled derivatives are recorded as operating activities on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nINTEREST RATE RISK\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of their issuance or anticipated issuance of variable-rate and fixed-rate debt and commercial paper. Interest rate risk is managed by limiting variable-rate exposures to a percentage of total debt and by monitoring changes in interest rates. To manage risk associated with changes in interest rates, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into interest rate swaps, U.S. Treasury lock agreements and other financial contracts. In anticipation of certain fixed-rate debt issuances, a series of forward-starting interest rate swaps or Treasury locks may be executed to lock in components of current market interest rates. These instruments are later terminated prior to or upon the issuance of the corresponding debt.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor a derivative designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the effective portion of the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once the future transaction impacts earnings. Amounts for interest rate contracts are reclassified to earnings as interest expense over the term of the related debt. Gains and losses reclassified out of AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were not material. Duke Energy's interest rate derivatives designated as hedges include interest rate swaps used to hedge existing debt within the Commercial Renewables segment and forward-starting interest rate swaps not accounted for under regulatory accounting.\nUndesignated Contracts\nUndesignated contracts primarily include contracts not designated as a hedge because they are accounted for under regulatory accounting or contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting.\nDuke Energy’s interest rate swaps for its regulated operations employ regulatory accounting. With regulatory accounting, the mark-to-market gains or losses on the swaps are deferred as regulatory liabilities or regulatory assets, respectively. Regulatory assets and liabilities are amortized consistent with the treatment of the related costs in the ratemaking process. The accrual of interest on the swaps is recorded as Interest Expense on the Duke Energy Registrant's Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income.\n180\nThe following tables show notional amounts of outstanding derivatives related to interest rate risk.\n(a)    Duke Energy includes amounts related to consolidated VIEs of $\n665\nmillion in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2021, and $\n632\nmillion in cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2020.\nCOMMODITY PRICE RISK\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are exposed to the impact of changes in the prices of electricity purchased and sold in bulk power markets and natural gas purchases, including Piedmont's natural gas supply contracts. Exposure to commodity price risk is influenced by a number of factors including the term of contracts, the liquidity of markets and delivery locations. To manage risk associated with commodity prices, the Duke Energy Registrants may enter into long-term power purchase or sales contracts and long-term natural gas supply agreements.\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivatives designated as hedging the exposure to variable cash flows of a future transaction, referred to as a cash flow hedge, the derivative's gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings once the future transaction impacts earnings. Gains and losses reclassified out of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) for the year ended December 31, 2021\n,\n2020\nand\n2019,\nw\nere not material. Duke Energy’s commodity derivatives designated as hedges include long-term electricity sales in the Commercial Renewables segment.\nUndesignated Contracts\nFor the Subsidiary Registrants, bulk power electricity and natural gas purchases flow through fuel adjustment clauses, formula-based contracts or other cost sharing mechanisms. Differences between the costs included in rates and the incurred costs, including undesignated derivative contracts, are largely deferred as regulatory assets or regulatory liabilities. Piedmont policies allow for the use of financial instruments to hedge commodity price risks. The strategy and objective of these hedging programs are to use the financial instruments to reduce natural gas cost volatility for customers.\nVolumes\nThe tables below include volumes of outstanding commodity derivatives. Amounts disclosed represent the absolute value of notional volumes of commodity contracts excluding NPNS. The Duke Energy Registrants have netted contractual amounts where offsetting purchase and sale contracts exist with identical delivery locations and times of delivery. Where all commodity positions are perfectly offset, no quantities are shown.\n(a)    Duke Energy includes\n9,975\nGWh and\n22,048\nGWh related to cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\n181\nLOCATION AND FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\nThe following tables show the fair value and balance sheet location of derivative instruments. Although derivatives subject to master netting arrangements are netted on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, the fair values presented below are shown gross and cash collateral on the derivatives has not been netted against the fair values shown.\n182\n183\nOFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES\nThe following tables present the line items on the Consolidated Balance Sheets where derivatives are reported. Substantially all of Duke Energy's outstanding derivative contracts are subject to enforceable master netting arrangements. The gross amounts offset in the tables below show the effect of these netting arrangements on financial position and include collateral posted to offset the net position. The amounts shown are calculated by counterparty. Accounts receivable or accounts payable may also be available to offset exposures in the event of bankruptcy. These amounts are not included in the tables below.\n184\n15.\nINVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES\nDuke Energy’s investments in debt and equity securities are primarily comprised of investments held in (i) the NDTF at Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, (ii) the grantor trusts at Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida and Duke Energy Indiana related to OPEB plans and (iii) Bison. The Duke Energy Registrants classify investments in debt securities as AFS and investments in equity securities as FV-NI.\nFor investments in debt securities classified as AFS, the unrealized gains and losses are included in other comprehensive income until realized, at which time they are reported through net income. For investments in equity securities classified as FV-NI, both realized and unrealized gains and losses are reported through net income. Substantially all of Duke Energy’s investments in debt and equity securities qualify for regulatory accounting, and accordingly, all associated realized and unrealized gains and losses on these investments are deferred as a regulatory asset or liability.\nDuke Energy classifies the majority of investments in debt and equity securities as long term, unless otherwise noted.\nInvestment Trusts\nThe investments within the Investment Trusts are managed by independent investment managers with discretion to buy, sell and invest pursuant to the objectives set forth by the investment manager agreements and trust agreements. The Duke Energy Registrants have limited oversight of the day-to-day management of these investments. As a result, the ability to hold investments in unrealized loss positions is outside the control of the Duke Energy Registrants. Accordingly, all unrealized losses associated with debt securities within the Investment Trusts are recognized immediately and deferred to regulatory accounts where appropriate.\nOther AFS Securities\nUnrealized gains and losses on all other AFS securities are included in other comprehensive income until realized, unless it is determined the carrying value of an investment has a credit loss. The Duke Energy Registrants analyze all investment holdings each reporting period to determine whether a decline in fair value is related to a credit loss. If a credit loss exists, the unrealized credit loss is included in earnings. There were no material credit losses as of December 31, 2021, and 2020.\nOther Investments amounts are recorded in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n185\nDUKE ENERGY\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\n186\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows.\nPROGRESS ENERGY\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows.\n187\nDUKE ENERGY PROGRESS\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are classified as FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\n(a)    During the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, Duke Energy Florida continued to receive reimbursements from the NDTF for costs related to ongoing decommissioning activity of the Crystal River Unit 3.\n188\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were as follows.\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA\nThe following table presents the estimated fair value of investments in debt and equity securities; equity investments are measured at FV-NI and debt investments are classified as AFS.\nRealized gains and losses, which were determined on a specific identification basis, from sales of FV-NI and AFS securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, were immaterial.\nDEBT SECURITY MATURITIES\nThe table below summarizes the maturity date for debt securities.\n16.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair value is the exchange price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value definition focuses on an exit price versus the acquisition cost. Fair value measurements use market data or assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique. These inputs may be readily observable, corroborated by market data, or generally unobservable. Valuation techniques maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs. A midmarket pricing convention (the midpoint price between bid and ask prices) is permitted for use as a practical expedient.\nFair value measurements are classified in three levels based on the fair value hierarchy as defined by GAAP. Certain investments are not categorized within the fair value hierarchy. These investments are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient. The net asset value is derived based on the investment cost, less any impairment, plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes for an identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nFair value accounting guidance permits entities to elect to measure certain financial instruments that are not required to be accounted for at fair value, such as equity method investments or the company’s own debt, at fair value. The Duke Energy Registrants have not elected to record any of these items at fair value.\n189\nValuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows.\nInvestments in equity securities\nThe majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. Investments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the quarter. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as the NYSE and Nasdaq Stock Market. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. There was no after-hours market activity that was required to be reflected in the reported fair value measurements.\nInvestments in debt securities\nMost investments in debt securities are valued using Level 2 measurements because the valuations use interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3.\nCommodity derivatives\nCommodity derivatives with clearinghouses are classified as Level 1. Commodity derivatives with observable forward curves are classified as Level 2. If forward price curves are not observable for the full term of the contract and the unobservable period had more than an insignificant impact on the valuation, the commodity derivative is classified as Level 3. In isolation, increases (decreases) in natural gas forward prices result in favorable (unfavorable) fair value adjustments for natural gas purchase contracts; and increases (decreases) in electricity forward prices result in unfavorable (favorable) fair value adjustments for electricity sales contracts. Duke Energy regularly evaluates and validates pricing inputs used to estimate the fair value of natural gas commodity contracts by a market participant price verification procedure. This procedure provides a comparison of internal forward commodity curves to market participant generated curves.\nInterest rate derivatives\nMost over-the-counter interest rate contract derivatives are valued using financial models that utilize observable inputs for similar instruments and are classified as Level 2. Inputs include forward interest rate curves, notional amounts, interest rates and credit quality of the counterparties.\nOther fair value considerations\nSee Note 11 for a discussion of the valuation of goodwill and intangible assets.\nDUKE ENERGY\nThe following tables provide recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Derivative amounts in the tables below for all Duke Energy Registrants exclude cash collateral, which is disclosed in Note 14. See Note 15 for additional information related to investments by major security type for the Duke Energy Registrants.\n190\nThe following table provides reconciliations of beginning and ending balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements.\n(a)\nTransferred from Level 3 to Level 2 because observable market data became available.\nDUKE ENERGY CAROLINAS\nThe following tables provide recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n191\nPROGRESS ENERGY\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY PROGRESS\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY FLORIDA\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nDUKE ENERGY OHIO\nThe recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets were not material at December 31, 2021, and 2020.\n192\nDUKE ENERGY INDIANA\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements.\nPIEDMONT\nThe following table provides recorded balances for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of assets and liabilities measured at fair value using Level 3 measurements.\n(a)    Transferred from Level 3 to Level 2 because observable market data became available.\n193\nQUANTITATIVE INFORMATION ABOUT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS\nThe following tables include quantitative information about the Duke Energy Registrants' derivatives classified as Level 3.\nOTHER FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES\nThe fair value and book value of long-term debt, including current maturities, is summarized in the following table. Estimates determined are not necessarily indicative of amounts that could have been settled in current markets. Fair value of long-term debt uses Level 2 measurements.\n(a)    Book value of long-term de\nbt includes $\n1.25\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, and $\n1.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2020, of unamortized debt discount and premium, net in purchase accounting adjustments related to the mergers with Progress Energy and Piedmont that are excluded from fair value of long-term debt.\nAt both December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, fair value of cash and cash equivalents, accounts and notes receivable, accounts payable, notes payable and commercial paper, and nonrecourse notes payable of VIEs are not materially different from their carrying amounts because of the short-term nature of these instruments and/or because the stated rates approximate market rates.\n194\n17.\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nA VIE is an entity that is evaluated for consolidation using more than a simple analysis of voting control. The analysis to determine whether an entity is a VIE considers contracts with an entity, credit support for an entity, the adequacy of the equity investment of an entity and the relationship of voting power to the amount of equity invested in an entity. This analysis is performed either upon the creation of a legal entity or upon the occurrence of an event requiring reevaluation, such as a significant change in an entity’s assets or activities. A qualitative analysis of control determines the party that consolidates a VIE. This assessment is based on (i) what party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact its economic performance and (ii) what party has rights to receive benefits or is obligated to absorb losses that could potentially be significant to the VIE. The analysis of the party that consolidates a VIE is a continual reassessment.\nCONSOLIDATED VIEs\nThe obligations of the consolidated VIEs discussed in the following paragraphs are nonrecourse to the Duke Energy Registrants. The registrants have no requirement to provide liquidity to, purchase assets of or guarantee performance of these VIEs unless noted in the following paragraphs.\nNo\nfinancial support was provided to any of the consolidated VIEs during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, or is expected to be provided in the future, that was not previously contractually required.\nReceivables Financing – DERF/DEPR/DEFR\nDERF, DEPR and DEFR are bankruptcy remote, special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida, respectively. DERF, DEPR and DEFR are wholly owned LLCs with separate legal existence from their parent companies, and their assets are not generally available to creditors of their parent companies. On a revolving basis, DERF, DEPR and DEFR buy certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity and related services from their parent companies.\nDERF, DEPR and DEFR borrow amounts under credit facilities to buy these receivables. Borrowing availability from the credit facilities is limited to the amount of qualified receivables purchased, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligations is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facilities are reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt.\nThe most significant activity that impacts the economic performance of DERF, DEPR and DEFR are the decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Florida are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DERF, DEPR and DEFR, respectively, as they make those decisions.\nReceivables Financing – CRC\nCRC is a bankruptcy remote, special purpose entity indirectly owned by Duke Energy. On a revolving basis, CRC buys certain accounts receivable arising from the sale of electricity, natural gas and related services from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. CRC borrows amounts under a credit facility to buy the receivables from Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. Borrowing availability from the credit facility is limited to the amount of qualified receivables sold to CRC, which generally exclude receivables past due more than a predetermined number of days and reserves for expected past-due balances. The sole source of funds to satisfy the related debt obligation is cash collections from the receivables. Amounts borrowed under the credit facility are reflected on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets as Long-Term Debt.\nThe proceeds Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana receive from the sale of receivables to CRC are approximately\n75\n% cash and\n25\n% in the form of a subordinated note from CRC. The subordinated note is a retained interest in the receivables sold. Depending on collection experience, additional equity infusions to CRC may be required by Duke Energy to maintain a minimum equity balance of $\n3\nmillion.\nCRC is considered a VIE because (i) equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations, (ii) power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity is not held by the equity holder and (iii) deficiencies in net worth of CRC are funded by Duke Energy. The most significant activities that impact the economic performance of CRC are decisions made to manage delinquent receivables. Duke Energy is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates CRC as it makes these decisions. Neither Duke Energy Ohio nor Duke Energy Indiana consolidate CRC.\nReceivables Financing – Credit Facilities\nThe following table summarizes the amounts and expiration dates of the credit facilities and associated restricted receivables described above.\n195\nNuclear Asset-Recovery Bonds – Duke Energy Florida Project Finance, LLC (DEFPF)\nDEFPF is a bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiary of Duke Energy Florida. DEFPF was formed in 2016 for the sole purpose of issuing nuclear asset-recovery bonds to finance Duke Energy Florida's unrecovered regulatory asset related to Crystal River Unit 3.\nIn 2016, DEFPF issued senior secured bonds and used the proceeds to acquire nuclear asset-recovery property from Duke Energy Florida. The nuclear asset-recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable nuclear asset-recovery charge from all Duke Energy Florida retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The nuclear asset-recovery bonds are secured by the nuclear asset-recovery property and cash collections from the nuclear asset-recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Florida.\nDEFPF is considered a VIE primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support its operations. Duke Energy Florida has the power to direct the significant activities of the VIE as described above and therefore Duke Energy Florida is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates DEFPF.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of DEFPF on Duke Energy Florida's Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nStorm Recovery Bonds – Duke Energy Carolinas NC Storm Funding and Duke Energy Progress NC Storm Funding\nDuke Energy Carolinas NC Storm Funding, LLC. (DECNCSF) and Duke Energy Progress NC Storm Funding, LLC. (DEPNCSF) are bankruptcy remote, wholly owned special purpose subsidiaries of Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, respectively. These entities were formed in 2021 for the sole purpose of issuing storm recovery bonds to finance certain of Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke Energy Progress’ unrecovered regulatory assets related to storm costs.\nIn November 2021, DECNCSF and DEPNCSF issued $\n237\nmillion and $\n770\nmillion of senior secured bonds, respectively and used the proceeds to acquire storm recovery property from Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress. The storm recovery property was created by state legislation and NCUC financing orders for the purpose of financing storm costs incurred in 2018 and 2019. The storm recovery property acquired includes the right to impose, bill, collect and adjust a non-bypassable charge from all Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke Energy Progress’ retail customers until the bonds are paid in full and all financing costs have been recovered. The storm recovery bonds are secured by the storm recovery property and cash collections from the storm recovery charges are the sole source of funds to satisfy the debt obligation. The bondholders have no recourse to Duke Energy Carolinas or Duke Energy Progress. For additional information, see Notes 3 and 6.\nDECNCSF and DEPNCSF are considered VIEs primarily because the equity capitalization is insufficient to support their operations. Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress have the power to direct the significant activities of the VIEs as described above and therefore Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress are considered the primary beneficiaries and consolidate DECNCSF and DEPNCSF, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes the impact of these VIEs on Duke Energy Carolinas’ and Duke Energy Progress’ Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nCommercial Renewables\nCertain of Duke Energy’s renewable energy facilities are VIEs due to Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Assets are restricted and cannot be pledged as collateral or sold to third parties without prior approval of debt holders. Additionally, Duke Energy has VIEs associated with tax equity arrangements entered into with third-party investors in order to finance the cost of renewable assets eligible for tax credits. The activities that most significantly impacted the economic performance of these renewable energy facilities were decisions associated with siting, negotiating PPAs and EPC agreements, and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy is considered the primary beneficiary and consolidates the entities as it is responsible for all of these decisions.\n196\nThe table below presents material balances reported on Duke Energy's Consolidated Balance Sheets related to Commercial Renewables VIEs.\nNON-CONSOLIDATED VIEs\nThe following tables summarize the impact of non-consolidated VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants are not aware of any situations where the maximum exposure to loss significantly exceeds the carrying values shown above except for certain renewable energy project entities guarantees for debt services and operations and maintenance, as discussed below.\nPipeline Investments\nDuke Energy has investments in various joint ventures to construct and operate pipeline projects. These entities are considered VIEs due to having insufficient equity to finance their own activities without subordinated financial support. Duke Energy does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance, the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits of these VIEs and therefore does not consolidate these entities.\nDuke Energy has a\n47\n% ownership interest in ACP. In 2020, Duke Energy determined that it would no longer invest in the construction of the ACP pipeline. In February 2021, Duke Energy paid approximately $\n855\nmillion to fund ACP's outstanding debt, relieving Duke Energy of its guarantee. See Notes 3, 7 and 12 for further information regarding this transaction.\n197\nCommercial Renewables\nDuke Energy has investments in various renewable energy project entities. Duke Energy has a\n50\n% ownership in a VIE, which owns a portfolio of wind projects. This entity is a VIE as a result of Duke Energy issuing guarantees for debt service and operations and maintenance reserves in support of debt financings. Duke Energy does not consolidate this VIE because power to direct and control key activities is shared jointly by Duke Energy and the other owner. Duke Energy also has equity ownership in an entity, which owns a portfolio of fuel cell projects. Duke Energy does not consolidate the fuel cell portfolio as it does not have the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the entity.\nOVEC\nDuke Energy Ohio’s\n9\n% ownership interest in OVEC is considered a non-consolidated VIE due to OVEC having insufficient equity to finance its activities without subordinated financial support. The activities that most significantly impact OVEC's economic performance include fuel strategy and supply activities and decisions associated with ongoing operations and maintenance-related activities. Duke Energy Ohio does not have the unilateral power to direct these activities, and therefore, does not consolidate OVEC.\nAs a counterparty to an Inter-Company Power Agreement (ICPA), Duke Energy Ohio has a contractual arrangement to receive entitlements to capacity and energy from OVEC’s power plants through June 2040 commensurate with its power participation ratio, which is equivalent to Duke Energy Ohio's ownership interest. Costs, including fuel, operating expenses, fixed costs, debt amortization and interest expense, are allocated to counterparties to the ICPA based on their power participation ratio. The value of the ICPA is subject to variability due to fluctuation in power prices and changes in OVEC's cost of business. See Note 3 for additional information.\nCRC\nSee discussion under Consolidated VIEs for additional information related to CRC.\nAmounts included in Receivables from affiliated companies in the above table for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana reflect their retained interest in receivables sold to CRC. These subordinated notes held by Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana are stated at fair value. Carrying values of retained interests are determined by allocating carrying value of the receivables between assets sold and interests retained based on relative fair value. The allocated bases of the subordinated notes are not materially different than their face value because (i) the receivables generally turnover in less than two months, (ii) credit losses are reasonably predictable due to the broad customer base and lack of significant concentration and (iii) the equity in CRC is subordinate to all retained interests and thus would absorb losses first. The hypothetical effect on fair value of the retained interests assuming both a\n10\n% and a\n20\n% unfavorable variation in credit losses or discount rates is not material due to the short turnover of receivables and historically low credit loss history. Interest accrues to Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana on the retained interests using the acceptable yield method. This method generally approximates the stated rate on the notes since the allocated basis and the face value are nearly equivalent. An impairment charge is recorded against the carrying value of both retained interests and purchased beneficial interest whenever it is determined that an OTTI has occurred.\nKey assumptions used in estimating fair value are detailed in the following table.\nThe following table shows the gross and net receivables sold.\nThe following table shows sales and cash flows related to receivables sold.\n198\nCash flows from sales of receivables are reflected within Cash Flows From Operating Activities and Cash Flows from Investing Activities on Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCollection fees received in connection with servicing transferred accounts receivable are included in Operation, maintenance and other on Duke Energy Ohio’s and Duke Energy Indiana’s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Comprehensive Income. The loss recognized on sales of receivables is calculated monthly by multiplying receivables sold during the month by the required discount. The required discount is derived monthly utilizing a three-year weighted average formula that considers charge-off history, late charge history and turnover history on the sold receivables, as well as a component for the time value of money. The discount rate, or component for the time value of money, is the prior month-end LIBOR plus a fixed rate of\n1\n%.\n18.\nREVENUE\nDuke Energy recognizes revenue consistent with amounts billed under tariff offerings or at contractually agreed upon rates based on actual physical delivery of electric or natural gas service, including estimated volumes delivered when billings have not yet occurred. As such, the majority of Duke Energy’s revenues have fixed pricing based on the contractual terms of the published tariffs, with variability in expected cash flows attributable to the customer’s volumetric demand and ultimate quantities of energy or natural gas supplied and used during the billing period. The stand-alone selling price of related sales are designed to support recovery of prudently incurred costs and an appropriate return on invested assets and are primarily governed by published tariff rates or contractual agreements approved by relevant regulatory bodies. As described in Note 1, certain excise taxes and franchise fees levied by state or local governments are required to be paid even if not collected from the customer. These taxes are recognized on a gross basis as part of revenues. Duke Energy elects to account for all other taxes net of revenues.\nPerformance obligations are satisfied over time as energy or natural gas is delivered and consumed with billings generally occurring monthly and related payments due within 30 days, depending on regulatory requirements. In no event does the timing between payment and delivery of the goods and services exceed one year. Using this output method for revenue recognition provides a faithful depiction of the transfer of electric and natural gas service as customers obtain control of the commodity and benefit from its use at delivery. Additionally, Duke Energy has an enforceable right to consideration for energy or natural gas delivered at any discrete point in time and will recognize revenue at an amount that reflects the consideration to which Duke Energy is entitled for the energy or natural gas delivered.\nAs described above, the majority of Duke Energy’s tariff revenues are at-will and, as such, related contracts with customers have an expected duration of one year or less and will not have future performance obligations for disclosure. Additionally, other long-term revenue streams, including wholesale contracts, generally provide services that are part of a single performance obligation, the delivery of electricity or natural gas. As such, other than material fixed consideration under long-term contracts, related disclosures for future performance obligations are also not applicable.\nDuke Energy earns substantially all of its revenues through its reportable segments, Electric Utilities and Infrastructure, Gas Utilities and Infrastructure and Commercial Renewables.\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure\nElectric Utilities and Infrastructure earns the majority of its revenues through retail and wholesale electric service through the generation, transmission, distribution and sale of electricity. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale electric service customers with their full electric load requirements or with supplemental load requirements when the customer has other sources of electricity.\nRetail electric service is generally marketed throughout Duke Energy's electric service territory through standard service offers. The standard service offers are through tariffs determined by regulators in Duke Energy's regulated service territory. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, has multiple components such as an energy charge, a demand charge, a basic facilities charge and applicable riders. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing electric service, or in the case of distribution only customers in Duke Energy Ohio, for delivering electricity. Electricity is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time consistent with the series guidance and is provided and consumed over the billing period, generally one month. Retail electric service is typically provided to at-will customers who can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Additionally, Duke Energy adheres to applicable regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary. As such, revenue from contracts with customers for such contracts is equivalent to the electricity supplied and billed in that period (including unbilled estimates).\nWholesale electric service is generally provided under long-term contracts using cost-based pricing. FERC regulates costs that may be recovered from customers and the amount of return companies are permitted to earn. Wholesale contracts include both energy and demand charges. For full requirements contracts, Duke Energy considers both charges as a single performance obligation for providing integrated electric service. For contracts where energy and demand charges are considered separate performance obligations, energy and demand are each a distinct performance obligation under the series guidance and are satisfied as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided on a monthly basis. This service represents consumption over the billing period and revenue is recognized consistent with billings and unbilled estimates, which generally occur monthly. Contractual amounts owed are typically trued up annually based upon incurred costs in accordance with FERC published filings and the specific customer’s actual peak demand. Estimates of variable consideration related to potential additional billings or refunds owed are updated quarterly.\n199\nThe majority of wholesale revenues are full requirements contracts where the customers purchase the substantial majority of their energy needs and do not have a fixed quantity of contractually required energy or capacity. As such, related forecasted revenues are considered optional purchases.\nSupplemental requirements contracts that include contracted blocks of energy and capacity at contractually fixed prices have the following estimated remaining performance obligations:\nRevenues for block sales are recognized monthly as energy is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates.\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure\nGas Utilities and Infrastructure earns its revenue through retail and wholesale natural gas service through the transportation, distribution and sale of natural gas. Duke Energy generally provides retail and wholesale natural gas service customers with all natural gas load requirements. Additionally, while natural gas can be stored, substantially all natural gas provided by Duke Energy is consumed by customers simultaneously with receipt of delivery.\nRetail natural gas service is marketed throughout Duke Energy's natural gas service territory using published tariff rates. The tariff rates are established by regulators in Duke Energy's service territories. Each tariff, which is assigned to customers based on customer class, have multiple components, such as a commodity charge, demand charge, customer or monthly charge and transportation costs. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be aggregated into a single performance obligation for providing natural gas service. For contracts where Duke Energy provides all of the customer’s natural gas needs, the delivery of natural gas is considered a single performance obligation satisfied over time, and revenue is recognized monthly based on billings and unbilled estimates as service is provided and the commodity is consumed over the billing period. Additionally, natural gas service is typically at-will and customers can cancel service at any time, without a substantive penalty. Duke Energy also adheres to applicable regulatory requirements to ensure the collectability of amounts billed and receivable and appropriate mitigating procedures are followed when necessary.\nCertain long-term individually negotiated contracts exist to provide natural gas service. These contracts are regulated and approved by state commissions. The negotiated contracts have multiple components, including a natural gas and a demand charge, similar to retail natural gas contracts. Duke Energy considers each of these components to be a single performance obligation for providing natural gas service. This service represents consumption over the billing period, generally one month.\nFixed capacity payments under long-term contracts for the Gas Utilities and Infrastructure segment include minimum margin contracts and supply arrangements with municipalities and power generation facilities. Revenues for related sales are recognized monthly as natural gas is delivered and stand-ready service is provided, consistent with invoiced amounts and unbilled estimates.\nEstimated remaining performance obligations are as follows:\nCommercial Renewables\nCommercial Renewables earns the majority of its revenues through long-term PPAs and generally sells all of its wind and solar facility output, electricity and RECs to customers. The majority of these PPAs have historically been accounted for as leases. For PPAs that are not accounted for as leases, the delivery of electricity and the delivery of RECs are considered separate performance obligations.\nThe delivery of electricity is a performance obligation satisfied over time and represents generation and consumption of the electricity over the billing period, generally one month. The delivery of RECs is a performance obligation satisfied at a point in time and represents delivery of each REC generated by the wind or solar facility. The majority of self-generated RECs are bundled with energy in Duke Energy’s contracts and, as such, related revenues are recognized as energy is generated and delivered as that pattern is consistent with Duke Energy’s performance. Commercial Renewables recognizes revenue based on the energy generated and billed for the period, generally one month, at contractual rates (including unbilled estimates) according to the invoice practical expedient. Amounts are typically due within 30 days of invoice.\nCommercial Renewables also earns revenues from installation of distributed solar generation resources, which is primarily composed of EPC projects to deliver functioning solar power systems, generally completed within two to 12 months from commencement of construction. The installation of distributed solar generation resources is a performance obligation that is satisfied over time. Revenue from fixed-price EPC contracts is recognized using the input method as work is performed based on the estimated ratio of incurred costs to estimated total costs.\nOther\nThe remainder of Duke Energy’s operations is presented as Other, which does not include material revenues from contracts with customers.\n200\nDisaggregated Revenues\nFor the Electric and Gas Utility and Infrastructure segments, revenue by customer class is most meaningful to Duke Energy as each respective customer class collectively represents unique customer expectations of service, generally has different energy and demand requirements, and operates under tailored, regulatory approved pricing structures. Additionally, each customer class is impacted differently by weather and a variety of economic factors including the level of population growth, economic investment, employment levels, and regulatory activities in each of Duke Energy’s jurisdictions. As such, analyzing revenues disaggregated by customer class allows Duke Energy to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers. For the Commercial Renewables segment, the majority of revenues from contracts with customers are from selling all of the unit-contingent output at contractually defined pricing under long-term PPAs with consistent expectations regarding the timing and certainty of cash flows.\nDisaggregated revenues are presented as follows:\n(a)    Other revenue sources include revenues from leases, derivatives and alternative revenue programs that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers. Alternative revenue programs in certain jurisdictions include regulatory mechanisms that periodically adjust for over or under collection of related revenues.\n201\n(a)    Other revenue sources include revenues from leases, derivatives and alternative revenue programs that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers. Alternative revenue programs in certain jurisdictions include regulatory mechanisms that periodically adjust for over or under collection of related revenues.\n202\n(a)    Other revenue sources include revenues from leases, derivatives and alternative revenue programs that are not considered revenues from contracts with customers. Alternative revenue programs in certain jurisdictions include regulatory mechanisms that periodically adjust for over or under collection of related revenues.\nAs described in Note 1, Duke Energy adopted the new guidance for credit losses effective January 1, 2020, using the modified retrospective method of adoption, which does not require restatement of prior year reported results.\nThe following table presents the reserve for credit losses for trade and other receivables based on adoption of the new standard.\nTrade and other receivables are evaluated based on an estimate of the risk of loss over the life of the receivable and current and historical conditions using supportable assumptions. Management evaluates the risk of loss for trade and other receivables by comparing the historical write-off amounts to total revenue over a specified period. Historical loss rates are adjusted due to the impact of current conditions, as well as forecasted conditions over a reasonable time period. The calculated write-off rate can be applied to the receivable balance for which an established reserve does not already exist. Management reviews the assumptions and risk of loss periodically for trade and other receivables.\n203\nThe aging of trade receivables is presented in the table below. Duke Energy considers receivables greater than 30 days outstanding past due.\n(a)    Unbilled revenues are recognized by applying customer billing rates to the estimated volumes of energy or natural gas delivered but not yet billed and are included within Receivables and Receivables of VIEs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b)    Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana sell, on a revolving basis, nearly all of their retail accounts receivable, including receivables for unbilled revenues, to an affiliate, CRC, and account for the transfers of receivables as sales. Accordingly, the receivables sold are not reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheets of Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana. See Note 17 for further information. These receivables for unbilled revenues are $\n82\nmillion and $\n121\nmillion for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and $\n87\nmillion and $\n134\nmillion for Duke Energy Ohio and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n(c)    Due to certain customer financial hardships created by the COVID-19 pandemic and resulting stay-at-home orders, Duke Energy permitted customers to defer payment of past-due amounts through an installment payment plan over a period of several months.\n19.\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nBasic EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is computed by dividing net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders, as adjusted for distributed and undistributed earnings allocated to participating securities and accumulated preferred dividends, by the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other agreements to issue common stock, such as equity forward sale agreements, were exercised or settled.\nDuke Energy’s participating securities are RSUs that are entitled to dividends declared on Duke Energy common stock during the RSUs vesting periods. Dividends declared on preferred stock are recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Operations as a reduction of net income to arrive at net income available to Duke Energy common stockholders. Dividends accumulated on preferred stock are an adjustment to net income used in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\n204\nThe following table presents Duke Energy’s basic and diluted EPS calculations, the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and common and preferred share dividends declared.\n(a)    Performance stock awards were not included in the dilutive securities calculation because the performance measures related to the awards had not been met.\nCommon Stock\nIn November 2019, Duke Energy filed a prospectus supplement and executed an Equity Distribution Agreement (EDA) under which it may sell up to $\n1.5\nbillion of its common stock through a new at-the-market (ATM) offering program, including an equity forward sales component. Under the terms of the EDA, Duke Energy may issue and sell shares of common stock through September 2022.\nSeparately, in November 2019, Duke Energy marketed an equity offering of\n28.75\nmillion shares of common stock through an Underwriting Agreement. In connection with the offering, Duke Energy entered into equity forward sales agreements with an initial forward price of $\n85.99\nper share. In March 2020, Duke Energy marketed approximately\n940,000\nshares of common stock through an equity forward transaction under the ATM with an initial forward price of $\n89.76\nper share. In May 2020, Duke Energy marketed approximately\n903,000\nshares of common stock through an equity forward transaction under the ATM with an initial forward price of $\n82.44\nper share. In August 2020, Duke Energy marketed approximately\n936,000\nshares of common stock through an equity forward transaction under the ATM with an initial forward price of $\n79.52\nper share.\nIn December 2020, Duke Energy physically settled the equity forwards by delivering\n32\nmillion shares of common stock in exchange for net cash proceeds of approximately $\n2.6\nbillion.\nPreferred Stock\nOn March 29, 2019, Duke Energy completed the issuance of\n40\nmillion depositary shares, each representing 1/1,000th share of its Series A Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, at a price of $\n25\nper depositary share. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of $\n973\nmillion after issuance costs with proceeds used for general corporate purposes and to reduce short-term debt. The preferred stock has a $\n25\nliquidation preference per depositary share and earns dividends on a cumulative basis at a rate of\n5.75\n% per annum. Dividends are payable quarterly in arrears on the 16th day of March, June, September and December, and began on June 16, 2019.\nThe Series A Preferred Stock has no maturity or mandatory redemption date, is not redeemable at the option of the holders and includes separate call options. The first call option allows Duke Energy to call the Series A Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $\n25.50\nper depositary share prior to June 15, 2024, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after a ratings event where a rating agency amends, clarifies or changes the criteria it uses to assign equity credit for securities such as the preferred stock. The second call option allows Duke Energy to call the preferred stock, in whole or in part, at any time, on or after June 15, 2024, at a redemption price of $\n25\nper depositary share. Duke Energy is also required to redeem all accumulated and unpaid dividends if either call option is exercised.\nOn September 12, 2019, Duke Energy completed the issuance of\n1\nmillion shares of its Series B Fixed-Rate Reset Cumulative Redeemable Perpetual Preferred Stock, at a price of $\n1,000\nper share. The transaction resulted in net proceeds of $\n989\nmillion after issuance costs with proceeds being used to pay down short-term debt, repay at maturity $\n500\nmillion senior notes due September 2019, and for general corporate purposes. The preferred stock has a $\n1,000\nliquidation preference per share and earns dividends on a cumulative basis at an initial rate of\n4.875\n% per annum. Dividends are payable semiannually in arrears on the 16th day of March and September, and began on March 16, 2020. On September 16, 2024, the First Call Date, and any fifth anniversary of the First Call Date (each a Reset Date), the dividend rate will reset based on the then current five-year U.S. Treasury rate plus a spread of\n3.388\n%.\nThe Series B Preferred Stock has no maturity or mandatory redemption date, is not redeemable at the option of the holders and includes separate call options. The first call option allows Duke Energy to call the Series B Preferred Stock at a redemption price of $\n1,020\nper share, in whole but not in part, at any time within 120 days after a ratings event. The second call option allows Duke Energy to call the preferred stock, in whole or in part, on the First Call Date or any subsequent Reset Date at a redemption price in cash equal to $\n1,000\nper share. Duke Energy is also required to redeem all accumulated and unpaid dividends if either call option is exercised.\n205\nDividends issued on its Series A and Series B Preferred Stock are subject to approval by the Board of Directors. However, the deferral of dividend payments on the preferred stock prohibits the declaration of common stock dividends.\nThe Series A and Series B Preferred Stock rank, with respect to dividends and distributions upon liquidation or dissolution:\n•\nsenior to Common Stock and to each other class or series of capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock that is expressly made subordinated to the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock;\n•\non a parity with any class or series of capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock that is not expressly made senior or subordinated to the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock;\n•\njunior to any class or series of capital stock established after the original issue date of the Series A and Series B Preferred Stock that is expressly made senior to the Series A or Series B Preferred Stock;\n•\njunior to all existing and future indebtedness (including indebtedness outstanding under Duke Energy's credit facilities, unsecured senior notes, junior subordinated debentures and commercial paper) and other liabilities with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against Duke Energy; and\n•\nstructurally subordinated to existing and future indebtedness and other liabilities of Duke Energy's subsidiaries and future preferred stock of subsidiaries.\nHolders of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock have no voting rights with respect to matters that generally require the approval of voting stockholders. The limited voting rights of holders of Series A and Series B Preferred Stock include the right to vote as a single class, respectively, on certain matters that may affect the preference or special rights of the preferred stock, except in the instance that Duke Energy elects to defer the payment of dividends for a total of six quarterly full dividend periods for Series A Preferred Stock or three semiannual full dividend periods for Series B Preferred Stock. If dividends are deferred for a cumulative total of six quarterly full dividend periods for Series A Preferred Stock or three semiannual full dividend periods for Series B Preferred Stock, whether or not for consecutive dividend periods, holders of the respective preferred stock have the right to elect two additional Board members to the Board of Directors.\n20.\nSEVERANCE\nDuring 2021, Duke Energy reviewed its operations and identified opportunities for improvement to better serve its customers. This operational review included workforce realignment to ensure the company is staffed with the right skill sets and number of teammates to execute the long-term vision for Duke Energy. As such, Duke Energy extended involuntary severance benefits to certain employees in specific areas as a part of these workforce realignment efforts.\nDuring 2020, as a result of partial settlements between Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and the Public Staff, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress deferred as Regulatory assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets, approximately $\n65\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion, respectively, of previously recorded severance charges within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. These severance charges were previously recorded during 2018, as Duke Energy reviewed its operations and identified opportunities for improvement to better serve its customers. This operational review included the company's workforce strategy and staffing levels to ensure the company was staffed with the right skill sets and number of teammates to execute the long-term vision for Duke Energy. As such, Duke Energy extended voluntary and involuntary severance benefits to certain employees in specific areas as a part of workforce planning and digital transformation efforts.\nThe following table presents the direct and allocated severance and related charges accrued for approximately\n290\nemployees in 2021,\n30\ne\nmployees in 2020 and\n140\nemployees in 2019, by the Duke Energy Registrants within Operation, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n(a)    Includes amortization of deferred severance charges of approximately $\n33\nmillion, $\n22\nmillion, $\n11\nmillion and $\n11\nmillion for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n(b)    Includes adjustments associated with 2018 severance charges of approximately $(\n3\n) million, $(\n2\n) million and $(\n1\n) million for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana, respectively.\n(c)    Includes unamortized deferred severance charges of approximately $(\n86\n) million, $(\n57\n) million, $(\n29\n) million and $(\n29\n) million for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n(d)    Includes adjustments associated with 2018 severance charges of approximately $(\n6\n) million, $(\n2\n) million, $(\n3\n) million and $(\n2\n) million for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy and Duke Energy Progress, respectively.\n206\nThe table below presents the severance liability for past and ongoing severance plans including the plans described above.\n21.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the 2015 Plan) provides for the grant of stock-based compensation awards to employees and outside directors. The 2015 Plan reserves\n10\nmillion shares of common stock for issuance. Duke Energy has historically issued new shares upon exercising or vesting of share-based awards. However, Duke Energy may use a combination of new share issuances and open market repurchases for share-based awards that are exercised or vest in the future. Duke Energy has not determined with certainty the amount of such new share issuances or open market repurchases.\nThe following table summarizes the total expense recognized by the Duke Energy Registrants, net of tax, for stock-based compensation.\nDuke Energy's pretax stock-based compensation costs, the tax benefit associated with stock-based compensation expense and stock-based compensation costs capitalized are included in the following table.\nRESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS\nRSU awards generally vest over periods from immediate to\nthree years\n. Fair value amounts are based on the market price of Duke Energy's common stock on the grant date.\nThe following table includes information related to RSU awards.\n207\nThe following table summarizes information about RSU awards outstanding.\nThe total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, was $\n45\nmillion, $\n43\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Duke Energy had $\n35\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n23\nmonths.\nPERFORMANCE AWARDS\nStock-based performance awards generally vest after\nthree years\nif performance targets are met. The actual number of shares issued will range from\nzero\nto\n200\n% of target shares, depending on the level of performance achieved.\nPerformance awards contain performance conditions and a market condition. The performance conditions are based on Duke Energy's cumulative adjusted EPS and total incident case rate (total incident case rate is one of our key employee safety metrics). The market condition is based on TSR of Duke Energy relative to a predefined peer group.\nRelative TSR is valued using a path-dependent model that incorporates expected relative TSR into the fair value determination of Duke Energy’s performance-based share awards. The model uses three-year historical volatilities and correlations for all companies in the predefined peer group, including Duke Energy, to simulate Duke Energy’s relative TSR as of the end of the performance period. For each simulation, Duke Energy’s relative TSR associated with the simulated stock price at the end of the performance period plus expected dividends within the period results in a value per share for the award portfolio. The average of these simulations is the expected portfolio value per share. Actual life to date results of Duke Energy’s relative TSR for each grant are incorporated within the model. For performance awards granted in 2021, the model used a risk-free interest rate of\n0.24\n%, which reflects the yield on three-year Treasury bonds as of the grant date, and an expected volatility of\n26.9\n% based on Duke Energy's historical volatility over three years using daily stock prices.\nThe following table includes information related to stock-based performance awards.\nThe following table summarizes information about stock-based performance awards outstanding and assumes payout at the target level.\nThe total grant date fair value of shares vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020, was $\n25\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion, respectively. At December 31, 2021, Duke Energy had $\n20\nmillion of unrecognized compensation cost, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n22\nmonths.\n208\n22.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nDEFINED BENEFIT RETIREMENT PLANS\nDuke Energy and certain subsidiaries maintain, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans. The Duke Energy plans cover most employees using a cash balance formula. Under a cash balance formula, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit consisting of pay credits based upon a percentage of current eligible earnings, age or age and years of service and interest credits. Certain employees are eligible for benefits that use a final average earnings formula. Under these final average earnings formulas, a plan participant accumulates a retirement benefit equal to the sum of percentages of their (i) highest three-, four-, or five-year average earnings, (ii) highest three-, four-, or five-year average earnings in excess of covered compensation per year of participation (maximum of\n35\nyears) or (iii) highest three-year average earnings times years of participation in excess of\n35\nyears. Duke Energy also maintains, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit retirement plans that cover certain executives. The qualified and non-qualified, non-contributory defined benefit plans are closed to new participants.\nDuke Energy uses a December 31 measurement date for its defined benefit retirement plan assets and obligations. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets as of December 31, 2021, were primarily attributable to actual investment performance that was less than expected investment performance. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2021, were primarily attributable to the increase in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations. Actuarial gains experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan assets as of December 31, 2020, were attributable to actual investment performance that exceeded expected investment performance. Actuarial losses experienced by the defined benefit retirement plans in remeasuring plan obligations as of December 31, 2020, were primarily attributable to the decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan obligations.\nNet periodic benefit costs disclosed in the tables below represent the cost of the respective benefit plan for the periods presented prior to capitalization of amounts reflected as Net property, plant and equipment, on the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Only the service cost component of net periodic benefit costs is eligible to be capitalized. The remaining non-capitalized portions of net periodic benefit costs are classified as either: (1) service cost, which is recorded in Operations, maintenance and other on the Consolidated Statements of Operations; or as (2) components of non-service cost, which is recorded in Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Amounts presented in the tables below for the Subsidiary Registrants represent the amounts of pension and other post-retirement benefit cost allocated by Duke Energy for employees of the Subsidiary Registrants. Additionally, the Consolidated Statements of Operations of the Subsidiary Registrants also include allocated net periodic benefit costs for their proportionate share of pension and post-retirement benefit cost for employees of Duke Energy’s shared services affiliate that provide support to the Subsidiary Registrants. However, in the tables below, these amounts are only presented within the Duke Energy column (except for amortization of settlement charges). These allocated amounts are included in the governance and shared service costs discussed in Note 13.\nDuke Energy’s policy is to fund amounts on an actuarial basis to provide assets sufficient to meet benefit payments to be paid to plan participants. Duke Energy does not anticipate making any contributions in 2022.\nThe following table includes information related to the Duke Energy Registrants’ contributions to its qualified defined benefit pension plans.\nQUALIFIED PENSION PLANS\nComponents of Net Periodic Pension Costs\n209\n(a)    Duke Energy amounts exclude $\n3\nmillion, $\n4\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion for the years ended December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\n(b)    Duke Energy Ohio amounts exclude $\n1\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion for the years ended December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and Regulatory Assets\n210\nReconciliation of Funded Status to Net Amount Recognized\n211\nAmounts Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n212\n(a)    Included in Other within Other Noncurrent Assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b)    Included in Accrued pension and other post-retirement benefit costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nInformation for Plans with Accumulated Benefit Obligation in Excess of Plan Assets\nAssumptions Used for Pension Benefits Accounting\nThe discount rate used to determine the current year pension obligation and following year’s pension expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nThe average remaining service period for participants in active plans and life expectancy of participants in inactive plans is\n14\nyears for Duke Energy, Duke Energy Progress and Duke Energy Ohio,\n15\nyears for Progress Energy and Duke Energy Florida,\n13\nyears for Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Indiana and\nnine years\nfor Piedmont.\n213\nThe following tables present the assumptions or range of assumptions used for pension benefit accounting.\nExpected Benefit Payments\nNON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS\nThe accumulated benefit obligation, which equals the projected benefit obligation for non-qualified pension plans, was $\n300\nmillion for Duke Energy, $\n12\nmillion for Duke Energy Carolinas, $\n104\nmillion for Progress Energy, $\n31\nmillion for Duke Energy Progress, $\n41\nmillion for Duke Energy Florida, $\n3\nmillion for Duke Energy Ohio, $\n2\nmillion for Duke Energy Indiana and $\n3\nmillion for Piedmont as of December 31, 2021.\nEmployer contributions, which equal benefits paid for non-qualified pension plans, were $\n24\nmillion for Duke Energy, $\n1\nmillion for Duke Energy Carolinas, $\n8\nmillion for Progress Energy, $\n3\nmillion for Duke Energy Progress and $\n3\nmillion for Duke Energy Florida for the year ended December 31, 2021. Employer contributions were not material for Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana or Piedmont for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nNet periodic pension costs for non-qualified pension plans were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nOTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS\nDuke Energy provides, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, some health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees on a contributory and non-contributory basis. Employees are eligible for these benefits if they have met age and service requirements at retirement, as defined in the plans. The health care benefits include medical, dental, vision and prescription drug coverage and are subject to certain limitations, such as deductibles and copayments.\nDuke Energy did not make any pre-funding contributions to its other post-retirement benefit plans during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n214\nComponents of Net Periodic Other Post-Retirement Benefit Costs\n(a)\nDuke Energy amounts exclude $\n5\nmillion, $\n6\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion for the years ended December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\n(b)    Duke Energy Ohio amounts exclude $\n1\nmillion, $\n1\nmillion and $\n2\nmillion for the years ended December 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, of regulatory asset amortization resulting from purchase accounting adjustments associated with Duke Energy's merger with Cinergy in April 2006.\n215\nAmounts Recognized in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income and Regulatory Assets and Liabilities\nReconciliation of Funded Status to Accrued Other Post-Retirement Benefit Costs\n216\nAmounts Recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets\n217\n(a)    Included in Other within Current Liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n(b)    Included in Accrued pension and other post-retirement benefit costs on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAssumptions Used for Other Post-Retirement Benefits Accounting\nThe discount rate used to determine the current year other post-retirement benefits obligation and following year’s other post-retirement benefits expense is based on a bond selection-settlement portfolio approach. This approach develops a discount rate by selecting a portfolio of high-quality corporate bonds that generate sufficient cash flow to provide for projected benefit payments of the plan. The selected bond portfolio is derived from a universe of non-callable corporate bonds rated Aa quality or higher. After the bond portfolio is selected, a single interest rate is determined that equates the present value of the plan’s projected benefit payments discounted at this rate with the market value of the bonds selected.\nThe average remaining service period of active covered employees is\nfour years\nfor Duke Energy,\nseven years\nfor Duke Energy Florida,\nsix years\nfor Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont and\nfive years\nfor Duke Energy Ohio.\nThe following tables present the assumptions used for other post-retirement benefits accounting.\nAssumed Health Care Cost Trend Rate\n218\nExpected Benefit Payments\nPLAN ASSETS\nDescription and Allocations\nDuke Energy Master Retirement Trust\nAssets for both the qualified pension and other post-retirement benefits are maintained in the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Approximately\n98\n% of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust assets were allocated to qualified pension plans and approximately\n2\n% were allocated to other post-retirement plans (comprised of 401(h) accounts), as of December 31, 2021, and 2020. The investment objective of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is to invest in a diverse portfolio of assets that is expected to generate positive surplus return over time (i.e., asset growth greater than liability growth) subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of enhancing the security of benefits for plan participants.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Duke Energy assumes pension and other post-retirement plan assets will generate a long-term rate of return of\n6.5\n%. The expected long-term rate of return was developed using a weighted average calculation of expected returns based primarily on future expected returns across asset classes considering the use of active asset managers, where applicable. The asset allocation targets were set after considering the investment objective and the risk profile. Equity securities are held for their higher expected returns. Debt securities are primarily held to hedge the qualified pension plan. Return seeking debt securities, hedge funds and other global securities are held for diversification. Investments within asset classes are diversified to achieve broad market participation and reduce the impact of individual managers or investments.\nEffective January 1, 2022, the target asset allocation for the Duke Energy Retirement Master Trust is\n60\n% liability hedging assets and\n40\n% return-seeking assets. Duke Energy periodically reviews its asset allocation targets, and over time, as the funded status of the benefit plans increase, the level of asset risk relative to plan liabilities may be reduced to better manage Duke Energy's benefit plan liabilities and reduce funded status volatility.\nThe Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust is authorized to engage in the lending of certain plan assets. Securities lending is an investment management enhancement that utilizes certain existing securities of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust to earn additional income. Securities lending involves the loaning of securities to approved parties. In return for the loaned securities, the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust receives collateral in the form of cash and securities as a safeguard against possible default of any borrower on the return of the loan under terms that permit the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust to sell the securities. The Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust mitigates credit risk associated with securities lending arrangements by monitoring the fair value of the securities loaned, with additional collateral obtained or refunded as necessary. The fair value of securities on loan was approximately $\n542\nmillion and $\n482\nmillion at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Cash and securities obtained as collateral exceeded the fair value of the securities loaned at December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively. Securities lending income earned by the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust was immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nQualified pension and other post-retirement benefits for the Subsidiary Registrants are derived from the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust, as such, each are allocated their proportionate share of the assets discussed below.\nThe following table includes the target asset allocations by asset class at December 31, 2021, and the actual asset allocations for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust.\n219\nOther post-retirement assets\nDuke Energy's other post-retirement assets are comprised of Voluntary Employees' Beneficiary Association (VEBA) trusts and 401(h) accounts held within the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust. Duke Energy's investment objective is to achieve sufficient returns, subject to a prudent level of portfolio risk, for the purpose of promoting the security of plan benefits for participants.\nThe following table presents target and actual asset allocations for the VEBA trusts at December 31, 2021.\nFair Value Measurements\nDuke Energy classifies recurring and non-recurring fair value measurements based on the fair value hierarchy as discussed in Note 16.\nValuation methods of the primary fair value measurements disclosed below are as follows:\nInvestments in equity securities\nInvestments in equity securities are typically valued at the closing price in the principal active market as of the last business day of the reporting period. Principal active markets for equity prices include published exchanges such as NASDAQ and NYSE. Foreign equity prices are translated from their trading currency using the currency exchange rate in effect at the close of the principal active market. Prices have not been adjusted to reflect after-hours market activity. The majority of investments in equity securities are valued using Level 1 measurements. When the price of an institutional commingled fund is unpublished, it is not categorized in the fair value hierarchy, even though the funds are readily available at the fair value.\nInvestments in corporate debt securities and U.S. government securities\nMost debt investments are valued based on a calculation using interest rate curves and credit spreads applied to the terms of the debt instrument (maturity and coupon interest rate) and consider the counterparty credit rating. Most debt valuations are Level 2 measurements. If the market for a particular fixed-income security is relatively inactive or illiquid, the measurement is Level 3. U.S. Treasury debt is typically Level 2.\nInvestments in short-term investment funds\nInvestments in short-term investment funds are valued at the net asset value of units held at year end and are readily redeemable at the measurement date. Investments in short-term investment funds with published prices are valued as Level 1. Investments in short-term investment funds with unpublished prices are valued as Level 2.\nDuke Energy Master Retirement Trust\nThe following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust qualified pension and other post-retirement assets.\n220\n(a)    Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont were allocated approximately\n26\n%,\n32\n%,\n15\n%,\n17\n%,\n5\n%,\n7\n% and\n4\n%, respectively, of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust at December 31, 2021. Accordingly, all amounts included in the table above are allocable to the Subsidiary Registrants using these percentages.\n(b)    Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\n(a)    Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress, Duke Energy Florida, Duke Energy Ohio, Duke Energy Indiana and Piedmont were allocated approximately\n26\n%,\n32\n%,\n15\n%,\n17\n%,\n5\n%,\n7\n% and\n4\n%, respectively, of the Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust at December 31, 2020. Accordingly, all amounts included in the table above are allocable to the Subsidiary Registrants using these percentages.\n(b)    Certain investments that are measured at fair value using the net asset value per share practical expedient have not been categorized in the fair value hierarchy.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of beginning and ending balances of Duke Energy Master Retirement Trust qualified pension and other post-retirement assets at fair value on a recurring basis where the determination of fair value includes significant unobservable inputs (Level 3).\nOther post-retirement assets\nThe following tables provide the fair value measurement amounts for VEBA trust assets.\n221\nEMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS\nRetirement Savings Plan\nDuke Energy or its affiliates sponsor, and the Subsidiary Registrants participate in, employee savings plans that cover substantially all U.S. employees. Most employees participate in a matching contribution formula where Duke Energy provides a matching contribution generally equal to\n100\n% of employee before-tax and Roth 401(k) contributions of up to\n6\n% of eligible pay per pay period. Dividends on Duke Energy shares held by the savings plans are charged to retained earnings when declared and shares held in the plans are considered outstanding in the calculation of basic and diluted EPS.\nFor new and rehired employees who are not eligible to participate in Duke Energy’s defined benefit plans, an additional employer contribution of\n4\n% of eligible pay per pay period, which is subject to a\nthree-year\nvesting schedule, is provided to the employee’s savings plan account. Certain Piedmont employees whose participation in a prior Piedmont defined benefit plan (that was frozen as of December 31, 2017) are eligible for employer transition credit contributions of\n3\n% to\n5\n% of eligible pay per period, for each pay period during the\nthree-year\nperiod ending December 31, 2020.\nThe following table includes pretax employer matching contributions made by Duke Energy and expensed by the Subsidiary Registrants.\n23.\nINCOME TAXES\nNorth Carolina's 2021 Appropriations Act\nOn November 18, 2021, North Carolina Senate Bill 105 (SB 105) was signed into law by Governor Roy Cooper. Starting with tax year 2025, SB 105 begins phasing out the North Carolina corporate income tax rate over five years, from a statutory rate of 2.5% to zero. Duke Energy recorded a net reduction of approximately $\n490\nmillion to its North Carolina deferred tax liability in the fourth quarter of 2021. The majority of this deferred tax liability reduction was offset by recording a regulatory liability pending NCUC determination of the disposition of the amounts related to Duke Energy Carolinas, Duke Energy Progress and Piedmont. In addition, Duke Energy recorded a net reduction of North Carolina consolidating deferred tax assets of approximately $\n25\nmillion to deferred state income tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2021. North Carolina SB 105 did not have a significant impact on the financial position, results of operation, or cash flows of Duke Energy, Duke Energy Carolinas, Progress Energy, Duke Energy Progress or Piedmont.\nConsolidated Appropriations Act\nOn December 27, 2020, the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) was signed into law. In addition to the CAA providing funding for government operations, it also provided tax provisions to assist with COVID-19 relief, including extending certain expiring tax provisions. The company has reviewed the provisions of the CAA and has determined that there are no material impacts on the financial statements as a result of the CAA being signed into law.\nCARES Act\nOn March 27, 2020, the CARES Act was enacted. The CARES Act is an emergency economic stimulus package in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Among other provisions, the CARES Act accelerates the remaining AMT credit refund allowances resulting in taxpayers being able to immediately claim a refund in full for any AMT credit carryforwards and deferral of certain 2020 payroll taxes. In the third quarter of 2020, Duke Energy received $\n572\nmillion related to these AMT credit carryforwards and $\n19\nmillion of interest income. In addition, the company deferred approximately $\n117\nmillion of payroll taxes, of which, 50% were paid by December 31, 2021, with the remaining 50% payable by December 31, 2022. The other provisions within the CARES Act do not materially impact Duke Energy's income tax accounting.\n222\nIncome Tax Expense\nComponents of Income Tax Expense\n(a)     Total deferred income taxes includes the generation of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $\n32\nmillion at Duke Energy Carolinas, $\n8\nmillion at Duke Energy Indiana, and $\n3\nmillion at Piedmont. In addition, total deferred income taxes includes utilization of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $\n150\nmillion at Duke Energy, $\n95\nmillion at Progress Energy, $\n14\nmillion at Duke Energy Progress, $\n64\nmillion at Duke Energy Florida, and $\n2\nmillion at Duke Energy Ohio.\n(a)    Total deferred income taxes includes the generation of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $\n20\nmillion at Duke Energy Carolinas, $\n3\nmillion at Duke Energy Progress, $\n8\nmillion at Duke Energy Indiana, and $\n11\nmillion at Piedmont. In addition, total deferred income taxes includes utilization of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $\n39\nmillion at Progress Energy, $\n30\nmillion at Duke Energy Florida and $\n79\nmillion at Duke Energy.\n223\n(a)    Total deferred income taxes includes the generation of tax credit carryforwards of $\n8\nmillion at Duke Energy Carolinas. In addition, total deferred income taxes includes utilization of NOL carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards of $\n243\nmillion at Progress Energy, $\n35\nmillion at Duke Energy Progress, $\n152\nmillion at Duke Energy Florida, $\n25\nmillion at Duke Energy Ohio, $\n60\nmillion at Duke Energy Indiana, $\n90\nmillion at Piedmont and $\n775\nmillion at Duke Energy.\nDuke Energy Income from Continuing Operations before Income Taxes\nStatutory Rate Reconciliation\nThe following tables present a reconciliation of income tax expense at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate to the actual tax expense from continuing operations.\n(a)    In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company recognized a federal capital gain in the amount of $\n426\nmillion. As a result, a valuation allowance of $\n85\nmillion related to a federal capital loss carryforward was released. This valuation allowance was originally recorded as a result of the 2019 sale of minority interest of certain renewable assets within the Commercial Renewables segment.\n224\nValuation allowances have been established for certain state NOL carryforwards and state income tax credits that reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that will be realized on a more-likely-than-not basis. The net change in the total valuation allowance is included in state income tax, net of federal income tax effect, in the above tables.\n225\nDEFERRED TAXES\nNet Deferred Income Tax Liability Components\n(a)    Primarily related to lease obligations and debt fair value adjustments.\nThe following table presents the expiration of tax credits and NOL carryforwards.\n(a)    A valuation allowance of $\n4\nmillion has been recorded on the Federal NOL carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(b)    A valuation allowance of $\n112\nmillion has been recorded on the state NOL and attribute carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(c)    A valuation allowance of $\n12\nmillion has been recorded on the foreign NOL carryforwards, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(d)    A valuation allowance of $\n390\nmillion has been recorded on the foreign tax credits, as presented in the Net Deferred Income Tax Liability Components table.\n(e)    Indefinite carryforward for Federal NOLs, and NOLs for states that have adopted the Tax Act's NOL provisions, generated in tax years beginning after December 31, 2017.\n226\n(a)    Primarily related to lease obligations and debt fair value adjustments.\nUNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS\nThe following tables present changes to unrecognized tax benefits.\n(a)    In the fourth quarter of 2021, the company recognized a federal capital gain in the amount of $\n426\nmillion. As a result of the capital gain, a previously recorded unrecognized tax benefit related to the character of a taxable loss has been reversed. See note (a) under the Statutory Rate Reconciliation table for more details.\n227\nThe following table includes additional information regarding the Duke Energy Registrants' unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021. Duke Energy Registrants do not anticipate a material increase or decrease in unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months.\n(a)    The Duke Energy Registrants are unable to estimate the specific amounts that would affect the ETR versus the regulatory liability.\nDuke Energy and its subsidiaries are no longer subject to federal, state, local or non-U.S. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2016, aside from certain state tax attributes carried forward for utilization in future years.\n24.\nOTHER INCOME AND EXPENSES, NET\nThe components of Other income and expenses, net on the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows.\n228\n25.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nFor information on subsequent events related to regulatory matters and commitments and contingencies, see Notes 3 and 4, respectively.\n229"

Customer Connect was previously implemented at Duke Energy Carolinas during the second quarter of 2021. As a result of this implementation, we modified certain existing internal controls and implemented new controls and procedures related to Customer Connect. We evaluated the design and operating effectiveness of these internal controls and do not believe this implementation had an adverse effect on our internal control over financial reporting.\nUnder the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, the Duke Energy Registrants have evaluated changes in internal control over financial reporting (as such term is defined in Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, and other than with respect to the Customer Connect SAP implementation, there were no other changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the year ended December 31, 2021, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal controls over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f). The Duke Energy Registrants’ internal control system was designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes, in accordance with GAAP. Due to inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with policies and procedures may deteriorate.\nThe Duke Energy Registrants’ management, including their Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of their internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the framework in the Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. Based on that evaluation, management concluded that its internal controls over financial reporting were effective as of December 31, 2021.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP, Duke Energy’s independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on the effectiveness of Duke Energy’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein. This report is not applicable to the Subsidiary Registrants as these companies are not accelerated or large accelerated filers.\n230\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the shareholders and the Board of Directors of Duke Energy Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of Duke Energy Corporation and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 24, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nManagement's Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.

    "text": "Equity Compensation Plan Information\nThe following table shows information as of December 31, 2021, about securities to be issued upon exercise of outstanding options, warrants and rights under Duke Energy's equity compensation plans, along with the weighted average exercise price of the outstanding options, warrants and rights and the number of securities remaining available for future issuance under the plans.\n(1)    As of December 31, 2021, no options were outstanding under equity compensation plans.\n(2)    Includes RSUs and performance shares (assuming the maximum payout level) granted under the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan, as well as shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Duke Energy Corporation Executive Savings Plan (Executive Savings Plan) or the Directors’ Savings Plan.\n(3)    Includes shares remaining available for issuance pursuant to stock awards under the Duke Energy Corporation 2015 Long-Term Incentive Plan.\n(4)    Includes shares that could be payable with respect to certain compensation deferred under the Executive Savings Plan or the Duke Energy Corporation Directors' Savings Plan (Directors' Savings Plan), each of which is a non-qualified deferred compensation plan described in more detail below.\n(5)    The number of shares remaining available for future issuance under equity compensation plans not approved by security holders cannot be determined because it is based on the amount of future voluntary deferrals, if any, under the Executive Savings Plan and the Directors' Savings Plan.\nUnder the Executive Savings Plan, participants can elect to defer a portion of their base salary and short‑term incentive compensation. Participants also receive a company matching contribution in excess of the contribution limits prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code under the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, which is the 401(k) plan in which employees are generally eligible to participate. Eligible participants may also earn pay credits based on age and length of service on eligible earnings that exceed limited prescribed by the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn general, payments are made following termination of employment or death in the form of a lump sum or installments, as selected by the participant. Participants may direct the deemed investment of their accounts (with certain exceptions) among investment options available under the Duke Energy Retirement Savings Plan, including the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. Participants may change their investment elections on a daily basis. Deferrals of equity awards are credited with earnings and losses based on the performance of the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund. The benefits payable under the plan are unfunded and subject to the claims of Duke Energy’s creditors.\nUnder the Directors’ Savings Plan, outside directors may elect to defer all or a portion of their annual compensation, generally consisting of retainers. Deferred amounts are credited to an unfunded account, the balance of which is adjusted for the performance of phantom investment options, including the Duke Energy Common Stock Fund, as elected by the director, and generally are paid when the director terminates his or her service from the Board of Directors.\nDuke Energy will provide additional information that is responsive to this Item 12 in its definitive proxy statement or in an amendment to this Annual Report not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year covered by this Annual Report. That information is incorporated in this Item 12 by reference."
