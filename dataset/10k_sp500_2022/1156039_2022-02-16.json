    "text": "General\nAt Anthem, our purpose\n–\nto improve the health of humanity\n–\nis central to who we are. It inspires all we do and is the driving force behind our unique approach to health. We know to meaningfully improve health we must take a broader view. That is why our foundational approach looks at whole health and its most critical drivers: social, behavioral and physical. We believe in working together to achieve our goals of improving lives and communities, simplifying healthcare and expecting more. We strive to accomplish these goals through a collaborative focus on execution and delivering for those we serve in order to become a lifetime, trusted health partner. With an unyielding commitment to meeting the needs of our diverse customers, we are guided by the following values:\n•\nLeadership\n– Redefine what is possible\n•\nCommunity\n– Committed, connected, invested\n•\nIntegrity\n– Do the right thing, with a spirit of excellence\n•\nAgility\n– Delivery today, transform tomorrow\n•\nDiversity\n– Open your hearts and minds\nIn pursuing our strategy and becoming a lifetime, trusted health partner, we intend to transform healthcare by taking a whole health approach and providing trusted and caring solutions, delivering quality products and services that give customers access to the care they need and removing barriers to health.\nWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving greater than 45 million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2021. We offer a broad spectrum of network-based managed care risk-based plans to Individual, Group, Medicaid and Medicare markets. In addition, we provide a broad array of managed care services to fee-based customers, including claims processing, stop loss insurance, provider network access, medical management, care management and wellness programs, actuarial services and other administrative services. We also provide services to the federal government in connection with our Federal Health Products & Services business, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. We provide an array of specialty services both to our subsidiary health plans and also unaffiliated health plans, including pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) services and dental, vision, life, disability and supplemental health insurance benefits, as well as integrated health services.\nWe are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states and Puerto Rico as AIM Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, Beacon, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. PBM services are offered through our IngenioRx, Inc. (“IngenioRx”) subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries.\nWe believe healthcare is local and that we have the strong local presence required to understand and meet local customer needs with regard to any product they are enrolled in with us. Further, we believe we are well-positioned to deliver what customers want: innovative, choice-based and affordable products; distinctive service; simplified transactions; and better access to information for quality care. Our local presence, combined with our national expertise, has created opportunities for collaborative programs that reward physicians and hospitals for clinical quality and excellence. We feel that our commitment to health improvement and care management provides added value to customers and healthcare professionals. Ultimately, we believe that practical and sustainable improvements in healthcare must focus on improving healthcare quality while managing\n-3-\ncosts for total affordability. We have implemented initiatives driving payment innovation and partnered with providers to lower cost and improve the quality of healthcare for our members, and we continue to develop new and innovative ways to effectively manage risk and engage our members. Further, we are expanding our financial arrangements with providers to include payment models that encourage value-based care. We believe focusing on quality of care rather than volume of care is the foundation for improving patient outcomes. Our value-based payment model supports patient-centered care by improving collaboration between providers and health partners and delivering to our patients the right care, at the right time, in the right place. In addition, we are focused on achieving efficiencies from our national scale while optimizing service performance for our customers. Finally, we expect to continue to rationalize our portfolio of businesses and products and align our investments to capitalize on new opportunities to drive growth in our existing markets and expand into new markets in the future.\nImpact on Our Results of Operations\nOur results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members, product pricing, medical management and health and wellness programs, including service coordination and case management for addressing complex and specialized healthcare needs, innovative product design and our ability to maintain or achieve improvement in our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) Star ratings. CMS Star ratings affect Medicare Advantage plan reimbursements as well as our eligibility to earn quality-based bonus payments for those plans. See “Regulation” below in this “Business” section for additional information on our CMS Star ratings. For additional information on our networks and provider relations, product pricing and healthcare cost management programs, see “Pricing and Underwriting of Our Products,” “Networks and Provider Relations,” “Medical Management Programs,” “Care Management and Wellness Products and Programs” and “Healthcare Quality Initiatives” below in this “Business” section.\nAdvances in medical technology, increases in specialty drug costs, increases in hospital expenditures and other provider costs, the aging of the population, other demographic characteristics and the COVID-19 pandemic continue to contribute to rising healthcare costs. Our managed care plans and products are designed to encourage providers and members to participate in quality, cost-effective health benefit programs by using the full range of our innovative medical management services, quality initiatives and financial incentives. We believe our market position and high business retention rates will enable us to realize the long-term benefits of investing in preventive and early detection programs. Our ability to provide cost-effective health benefits products and services is enhanced through a disciplined approach to internal cost containment, prudent management of our risk exposure and successful integration of acquired businesses. In addition, our ability to manage selling, general and administrative costs continues to be a driver of our overall profitability.\nThe future results of our operations will also be impacted by certain external forces and resulting changes in our business model and strategy. Changes to our business environment will continue as elected officials at the national and state levels enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election propose, modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. For additional discussion, see “Regulation” below in this “Business” section and Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur results of operations are also impacted by levels and mix of membership, which can change as a result of the quality and pricing of our health benefits products and services, an aging population, economic conditions, changes in unemployment, acquisitions, entry into new markets and expansions in or exits from existing markets. These membership trends could be negatively impacted by various factors that could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations such as general economic downturns that result in business failures, failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers, premium increases, benefit changes or our exit from a specific market. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” and Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continue to enhance interactions with customers, providers, brokers, agents, employees and other stakeholders through digital technology and improvements to internal operations. Our approach includes not only the sales and distribution of health benefits products through digital technology, but also implementing advanced capabilities that improve services benefiting customers, agents, brokers and providers while optimizing administrative costs. These enhancements can also help improve the quality, coordination and safety of healthcare through increased communications between patients and their physicians.\n-4-\nThrough our participation in various federal government programs, we generated approximately 20.7%, 20.3% and 20.7% of our total consolidated revenues from agencies of the U.S. government for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. These revenues are contained in our Government Business segment as described below. An immaterial amount of our total consolidated revenues is derived from activities outside of the U.S.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy, cause market instability and uncertainty in the labor market and put pressure on the healthcare system, and it has impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our membership, our benefit expense and our member behavior, including how members access healthcare services. We continue to assist our customers, providers, members and communities in addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by providing expanded benefit coverage for COVID-19 diagnostic tests, treatment and vaccine administration and taking steps to increase vaccinations by enabling, educating and encouraging vaccine acceptance among our members as well as in the communities in which we operate.\nCOVID-19 care, testing and vaccine administration, and the impact of new COVID-19 variants, have resulted in increased medical costs for us in 2021. In 2021, our Medicaid membership continued to grow as a result of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect will remain suspended at least until the second quarter of 2022. Our Commercial fee-based membership decreased in 2021 due to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. See Part II, Item 7, “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditions and Results of Operations - Business Trends - Medical Cost Trends” for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our healthcare costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as well as resulting legislative and regulatory changes to manage our response and assess and mitigate potential adverse impacts to our business. For additional discussion regarding our risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and our other risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nReportable Segments\nWe manage our operations by customer type through four reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other. We regularly evaluate the appropriateness of our reportable segments, particularly in light of organizational changes, merger and acquisition activity and changing laws and regulations.\nOur Commercial & Specialty Business segment offers plans and services to our Individual, Group risk-based, Group fee-based and BlueCard\n®\nmembers. The Commercial & Specialty Business segment offers health products on a full-risk basis; provides a broad array of administrative managed care services to our fee-based customers; and provides a variety of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life, disability and supplemental health insurance benefits as described below.\nOur Government Business segment includes our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services (“NGS”) and services provided to the federal government in connection with the FEHB business.\nOur IngenioRx segment includes our PBM business. IngenioRx markets and offers PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers, as well as to external customers outside of the health plans we own. IngenioRx has a comprehensive PBM services portfolio, which includes services such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities.\nOur Other segment includes our Diversified Business Group, which is our health services business focused on lowering the cost and improving the quality of healthcare by enabling and creating new care delivery and payment models, with a special emphasis on serving those with complex and chronic conditions. This segment also includes certain eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments.\nFor additional information, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-5-\nMembership\nOur medical membership includes seven different customer types: Individual, Group risk-based, Group fee-based, BlueCard\n®\n,\nMedicare, Medicaid and FEHB. In addition, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.\nOur products are generally developed and marketed with an emphasis on the differing needs of our customers. In particular, our product development and marketing efforts take into account the differing characteristics between the various customers served by us, as well as the unique needs of educational and public entities, labor groups, the FEHB program, national employers and state-run programs servicing low-income, high-risk and underserved markets. Overall, we seek to establish pricing and product designs to provide value for our customers while achieving an appropriate level of profitability for each of our customer categories balanced with the competitive objective to grow market share. We believe that one of the keys to our success has been our focus on these distinct customer types, which better enables us to develop benefit plans and services that meet our customers’ unique needs. Further, IngenioRx was built to simplify pharmacy care and focus on the whole person, and we expect it will make it easier for our customers to achieve better health outcomes at a lower total cost of care.\nWe market our Individual, Medicare and certain Group products with a smaller employee base through direct marketing activities and an extensive network of independent agents, brokers and retail partnerships. Products for Commercial customers with a larger employee base are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. In the Individual markets, we offer on-exchange products through state- or federally-facilitated marketplaces (the “Public Exchange”) in compliance with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the “ACA”) and off-exchange products. Federal subsidies are available for certain members, subject to income and family size, who purchase Public Exchange products.\nIn 2021, we made the decision to modestly expand our participation in the Public Exchange market for 2022 after also expanding in 2021. As a result, for 2022 we are offering Individual Public Exchange products in 122 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate, in comparison to 103 of 143 rating regions in 2021. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment and underlying market characteristics.\nBeing a licensee of the BCBS association of companies, of which there were 34 independent primary licensees including us as of December 31, 2021, provides significant market value, especially when competing for very large multi-state employer groups. For example, each BCBS member company is able to utilize other BCBS licensees’ substantial provider networks and discounts when any BCBS member works or travels outside of the state in which their policy is written. This program is referred to as BlueCard\n®\n. BlueCard\n®\nhost members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan serviced by a non-Anthem controlled BCBS licensee, which is the “home” plan. We perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard\n®\nhost members, including claims pricing and administration, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard\n®\nmembers’ home plan. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer services, are performed by the home plan. See “BCBSA Licenses” below in this “Business” section for additional information on our BCBSA licenses. We refer to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA as our BCBS-branded business. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded Amerigroup, Freedom Health, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as HealthLink and UniCare members.\nFor additional information describing each of our customer types and changes in medical membership over the last three years, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -\nMembership\n” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-6-\nProduct and Service Descriptions\nVarious forms of managed care products have been developed to contain the cost of healthcare by negotiating contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers to deliver high-quality healthcare to members at favorable rates. These products usually feature medical management and other quality and cost optimization measures such as pre-admission review and approval for certain non-emergency services, pre-authorization of outpatient surgical procedures, network credentialing to determine that network physicians and hospitals have the required certifications and expertise, and various levels of care management programs to help members better understand and navigate the healthcare system. In addition, providers may have incentives to achieve certain quality measures, may share medical cost risk or may have other incentives to deliver quality medical services in a cost-effective manner. Also, certain plans offer members incentives for healthy behaviors, such as smoking cessation and weight management. Members are charged periodic, prepaid premiums and generally pay co-payments, coinsurance and/or deductibles when they receive services.\nCommercial & Specialty Business\n•\nCommercial Risk-Based Products.\nOur Commercial & Specialty Business offers a diversified mix of managed care risk-based products including: Preferred Provider Organization (“PPO”), Health Maintenance Organization (“HMO”), Consumer-Driven Health Plans (“CDHP”), Traditional Indemnity and Point-of-Service (“POS”) plans. PPO plans generally provide members the freedom to choose any healthcare provider, but require the member to pay a greater portion of the provider’s fee in the event the member chooses not to use a provider participating in the PPO’s network. HMOs include comprehensive managed care benefits generally through a participating network of physicians, hospitals and other providers. CDHPs generally combine a high-deductible PPO plan with an employer-funded and/or employee-funded personal care account, which may result in tax benefits to the employee and allow some or all of the dollars remaining in the personal care account at year-end to be rolled over to the next year for future healthcare needs. Traditional indemnity plans offer the member an option to select any healthcare provider for covered services, with coverage subject to deductibles and coinsurance and with member cost-sharing usually limited by out-of-pocket maximums. POS products blend the characteristics of HMO, PPO and indemnity plans. In general, POS plans allow members to choose to seek care from a provider within the plan’s network or outside the network, subject to, among other things, certain deductibles and coinsurance.\nWe also offer Individual risk-based products on and off the Public Exchange, covering essential health benefits (as defined in the ACA) along with many other requirements and cost-sharing features.\n•\nCommercial Fee-Based Products.\nOur Commercial & Specialty Business provides a broad array of managed care services to fee-based customers, including claims processing, stop loss insurance, provider network access, medical management, care management and wellness programs, actuarial services and other administrative services. Fee-based health plans are also able to use our provider networks and to realize savings through our negotiated provider arrangements, while allowing employers the ability to design certain health benefit plans in accordance with their own requirements and objectives. We also charge a premium to underwrite stop loss insurance for employers that maintain fee-based plans but want to limit their retained risk.\nIn addition, we perform certain administrative functions for BlueCard\n®\nhost members, discussed under “Membership” above, including claims pricing and administration, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard\n®\nmembers’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan.\n•\nSpecialty Products.\nWe offer an array of products and services to both risk-based and fee-based customers in conjunction with our health plans as well as to unaffiliated healthcare plans that are not Anthem subsidiaries.\n◦\nDental.\nOur dental plans include networks in certain states in which we operate and are offered on both a risk-based and fee-based basis. Our members also have access to additional dental providers through our participation in the National Dental GRID, a national dental network developed by and for BCBS plans that offers in-network discounts across the country.\n◦\nVision.\nOur vision plans include networks within the states in which we operate and are offered on both a risk-based and fee-based basis.\n-7-\n◦\nLife.\nWe offer an array of competitive individual and group term life insurance benefit products. The life insurance products include term life and accidental death and dismemberment.\n◦\nDisability.\nWe offer short-term and long-term disability and leave of absence products.\n◦\nSupplemental Health.\nWe offer supplemental health products, including accident, critical illness and hospital indemnity, which provide coverage for specific conditions or circumstances.\nGovernment Business\n•\nMedicare Plans.\nWe offer a wide variety of plans, products and options to individuals age 65 and older such as Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans (“MMPs”), Medicare Supplement plans and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (“Medicare Part D”).\nMedicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our Medicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Medicare Advantage members in our Group Retiree Solutions business who are retired members of Commercial accounts, or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our Commercial accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through us. MMP is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries.\n•\nMedicaid Plans and Other State-Sponsored Programs.\nOur Medicaid business includes our managed care alternatives through public-funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid; Medicaid expansion programs; Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (“TANF”); programs for seniors and people with disabilities (“SPD”); Children’s Health Insurance Programs (“CHIP”); and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support (“LTSS”), HIV/AIDS, children living in foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities and/or developmental disabilities. The Medicaid program makes federal matching funds available to all states for the delivery of healthcare benefits for low income and/or high medical risk individuals. These programs are managed by the individual states based on broad federal guidelines. Our Medicaid plans also cover certain dual-eligible customers, as previously described above, who also receive Medicare benefits. As of December 31, 2021, we provide Medicaid and other state sponsored services, such as administrative services, in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Puerto Rico, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin.\n•\nFederal Employees Health Benefits Program.\nFEHB members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management.\n•\nMedicare Administrative Operations.\nThrough our NGS subsidiary, we serve as a fiscal intermediary, carrier and Medicare administrative contractor for the federal government by providing administrative services for the Medicare program, Parts A and B, which generally provides coverage for persons who are 65 or older and for persons who are under 65 and disabled or with end-stage renal disease. Part A of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by hospitals, skilled nursing facilities and other healthcare facilities. Part B of the Medicare program provides coverage for services provided by physicians, physical and occupational therapists and other professional providers, as well as certain durable medical equipment and medical supplies.\nIngenioRx\nOur subsidiary IngenioRx markets and offers PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country in both our Commercial & Specialty and our Government business segments, as well as to customers outside of\n-8-\nthe health plans we own. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, a prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities.\nIngenioRx delegates certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation (“CVS Health”), pursuant to a five-year agreement (the “CVS PBM Agreement”). With IngenioRx, we retain the responsibilities for clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy. From December 2009 through December 2019, we delegated certain PBM functions and administrative services to Express Scripts Inc. (“Express Scripts”). Express Scripts managed the network of pharmacy providers, operated mail order pharmacies and processed prescription drug claims on our behalf, while we sold and supported the product for our members, made formulary decisions, sold drug benefit design strategy and provided front line member support. We began transitioning existing members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx in the second quarter of 2019, and completed the transition by January 1, 2020.\nCompetition\nThe managed care industry is highly competitive, both nationally and in our local markets. Competition continues to be intense due to aggressive marketing, pricing, bid activity for government-sponsored programs, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, new competitors in the market, a proliferation of new products, technological advancements, the impact of legislative reform, increased quality awareness and price sensitivity among customers and changing market practices, such as increased usage of telehealth.\nWe believe that participants in the managed care industry compete for customers based on quality of service, price, access to provider networks, access to care management and wellness programs (including health information), innovation, effective use of digital technology, breadth and flexibility of products and benefits, expertise and reputation (including National Committee on Quality Assurance (“NCQA”) accreditation status as well as CMS Star ratings), brand recognition and financial stability. Our ability to attract and retain customers is substantially tied to our ability to distinguish ourselves from our competitors in these areas.\nWe believe our exclusive right to market products under the most recognized brand in the industry, BCBS, in our most significant markets provides us with greater brand recognition over competitive product offerings. Typically, we are the largest participant in each of our BCBS branded markets and, thus, are closely-watched by other health benefits companies.\nProduct pricing remains competitive and we strive to price our health benefit products and design our Medicare and Medicaid bids consistent with anticipated underlying medical trends. We believe our pricing and bid strategy, based on predictive modeling, proprietary research and data-driven processes, has positioned us to benefit from the potential growth opportunities available through entry into new markets, expansions in existing markets and as a result of any future changes to the current regulatory scheme. We believe that our pricing and bid strategy, brand name and network quality will provide a strong foundation for membership growth opportunities in the future.\nOur provider networks give us a highly competitive unit cost position and provide distinctive service levels which allow us to offer a broad range of affordable health benefit products to our customers. To build our provider networks, we compete with other health benefits plans for the best contracts with hospitals, physicians and other providers. We believe that physicians and other providers primarily consider customer volume, reimbursement rates, timeliness of reimbursement and administrative service capabilities along with the reduction of non-value added administrative tasks when deciding whether to contract with a health benefits plan.\nAt the sales and distribution level, we compete for qualified agents and brokers to recommend and distribute our products. Strong competition exists among insurance companies and health benefits plans for agents and brokers with demonstrated ability to secure new business and maintain existing accounts. We believe that the quality and price of our products, support services, reputation and prior relationships, along with a reasonable commission structure, are the factors agents and brokers consider in choosing whether to market our products. We believe that we have good relationships with our agents and brokers, and that our products, support services and commission structure compare favorably to those of our competitors in all of our markets.\n-9-\nIn addition, the PBM industry is highly competitive, and IngenioRx is subject to competition from national, regional and local PBMs, insurers, health plans, large retail pharmacy chains, large retail stores, supermarkets, mail order pharmacies, web pharmacies and specialty pharmacies. Strong competition within the PBM industry has generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings.\nPricing and Underwriting of Our Products\nWe price our products based on our assessment of current healthcare claim costs and emerging healthcare cost trends, combined with charges for administrative expenses, risk and profit. We continually review our product designs and pricing guidelines on a national and regional basis so that our products remain competitive and consistent with our profitability goals and strategies.\nOur revenue on Medicare policies is based on annual bids submitted to CMS. We base the Commercial and Medicaid premiums we charge and our Medicare bids on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period. In applying our pricing to each employer group and customer, we aim to maintain consistent, competitive and disciplined underwriting standards. We employ our proprietary accumulated actuarial and financial data to determine underwriting and pricing parameters for both our risk-based and fee-based businesses.\nIn most circumstances, our pricing and underwriting decisions follow a prospective rating process in which a fixed premium is determined at the beginning of the contract period. For our risk-based business, any deviation, favorable or unfavorable, from the medical costs assumed in determining the premium is our responsibility. Some of our larger groups employ retrospective rating reviews, where positive experience is partially refunded to the group, and negative experience is charged against a rate stabilization fund established from the group’s favorable experience or charged against future favorable experience. In addition, our ACA and government risk-based contracts may include minimum medical loss ratio, risk adjustment, or risk corridor arrangements, which also stabilize premiums based upon claims experience.\nOur pharmacy pricing through IngenioRx is presented to market via discounts off the average wholesale price for drugs dispensed through the retail, mail and specialty channels as well as through rebate projections. We utilize group-specific script data, formulary, network and clinical care program selection combined with administrative expense, risk and profit guidance to set market competitive pricing discounts and rebate projections. Pharmacy pricing guidelines guide the underwriting process and undergo an annual external review process to ensure market competitiveness.\nNetworks and Provider Relations\nOur relationships with physicians, hospitals and professionals that render healthcare services to our members are guided by local, regional and national standards for network development, reimbursement and contract methodologies. While following industry standards, we are simultaneously seeking to lead transformation efforts within our healthcare system, moving from a fragmented model premised on episodic intervention to one based on proactive, coordinated care built around the needs of the patient. A key element of this transformation involves a transition from traditional fee-for-service payment models to models where providers are paid based on the value, both in quality and affordability, of the care they deliver.\nWe establish “market-based” hospital reimbursement payments that we believe are fair, but aggressive, and among the most competitive in the market. We also seek to ensure that physicians in our network are paid in a timely manner at appropriate rates. In many instances, we deploy multi-year contracting strategies, including case rates or fixed rates, to limit our exposure to medical cost inflation and to increase cost predictability. We maintain both broad and narrow provider networks to ensure member choice, based on both price and access needs, while implementing programs designed to improve the quality of care our members receive. Increasingly, we are supplementing our broad-based networks with smaller or more cost-effective networks that are designed to be attractive to a more price-sensitive customer segment, such as Public Exchange customers.\nOur reimbursement strategies vary across markets and depend on the degree of consolidation and integration of physician groups and hospitals. Under a fee-for-service reimbursement methodology for physicians, fee schedules are developed at the state level based on an assessment of several factors and conditions, including the CMS resource-based relative value system (“RBRVS”), medical practice cost inflation and physician supply. We utilize CMS RBRVS fee schedules as a reference point for fee schedule development and analysis. The RBRVS structure was developed, maintained, and updated by CMS and is used by the Medicare program and other major health plans. In addition, we have implemented\n-10-\nand continue to expand physician incentive contracting, or “pay-for-performance,” which ties physician payment levels to performance on clinical measures.\nWhile we generally do not delegate full financial responsibility to our physician providers in the form of capitation-based reimbursement, we maintain capitation-based arrangements in certain markets where we determine that market dynamics result in it being a useful method to lower costs and reduce underwriting risk.\nOur hospital contracts provide for a variety of reimbursement arrangements depending on local market dynamics and current hospital utilization efficiency. Most hospitals are reimbursed a fixed amount per day or reimbursed a per-case amount, per admission, for inpatient covered services. A small percentage of hospitals, primarily rural, sole community hospitals, are reimbursed on a discount from approved charge basis for covered services. Our “per-case” reimbursement methods utilize many of the same attributes contained in Medicare’s Diagnosis Related Groups methodology. Hospital outpatient services are reimbursed by fixed case rates, fee schedules or percent of approved charges. Our hospital contracts recognize unique hospital attributes, such as academic medical centers or community hospitals, and the volume of care performed for our members. To improve predictability of expected costs, we frequently use a multi-year contracting approach with providers. In addition, the majority of our hospital contracts include a pay-for-performance component where reimbursement levels are linked to improved clinical performance, patient safety and medical error reduction.\nOur provider engagement and contracting strategies have evolved to include several new value-based contracting arrangements that meet providers where they are in the movement from traditional fee-for-service to value-based care. These programs are designed to support Commercial, Medicare and Medicaid programs and the unique characteristics of these populations. Our value-based contracting programs are designed to reward our contracted providers for improving the overall quality of care they deliver by adhering to evidence-based medicine. In addition, these value-based contracts also share with the providers total cost of care savings that are achieved by adhering to evidence-based medicine over time. For providers who contract in one of our value-based programs, we work with them to share gaps in care information and other important data to assist them in managing the care of their patients. Often providers will also grant us access to data to support the efficient administration of program components. This data can allow us to more efficiently capture information regarding the risk of our membership and the overall adherence to evidence-based medicine, as well as information to more efficiently perform utilization management administration.\nSeasonality\nWe experience seasonality in our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments. While our premium revenues are not seasonal, our benefit costs typically increase during the year as our risk-based members pay their annual deductibles and reach their out-of-pocket maximum limits. However, this seasonality may change in the future as the COVID-19 pandemic continues.\nMedical Management Programs\nOur medical management programs include a broad array of activities that facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost-effective medical care. These medical management activities and programs are administered and directed by physicians and nurses. The goals of our medical management strategies are to ensure that the care delivered to our members is supported by appropriate medical and scientific evidence, is received on a timely basis and occurs in the most appropriate setting. The following is a general description of our medical management programs, which are available to our members depending on the particular plan or product in which they participate:\nCare coordination:\nA traditional medical management strategy we use is care coordination, which is based on nationally recognized criteria developed by third-party medical specialists. With inpatient care coordination, the requirements and intensity of services during a patient’s hospital stay are reviewed, at times by an onsite, skilled nurse professional in collaboration with the hospital’s medical and nursing staff, in order to coordinate care and determine the most effective transition of care from the hospital setting. In addition, continued stay cases are reviewed with physician medical directors to ensure appropriate utilization of medical services. We also coordinate care for outpatient services to help ensure that patients with chronic conditions who receive care from multiple physicians are able to manage the exchange of information between physicians and coordinate office visits to their physicians.\n-11-\nCase management:\nWe have implemented a medical management strategy focused on identifying the small percentage of the membership that will require a high level of intervention and assistance to manage their healthcare needs. Case management identifies members who are likely to be re-admitted to the hospital through claims analysis using predictive modeling techniques, the use of health risk assessment data, utilization management reports and referrals from a physician or one of our other programs, such as the 24/7 NurseLine. Registered nurses, medical directors, behavioral health experts, pharmacists and other clinicians focus on these members and help them coordinate their care through pharmacy compliance, post-hospital care, follow-up visits to see their physician and support in their home. Increasingly, we collaborate with our providers and key health partners within the member’s provider care team by providing actionable patient data insights, practice-coaching capabilities, technology and programs, and products that help our providers and health partners to successfully deliver the right care, at the right time, in the right place.\nPrecertification:\nPrecertification involves assessment of the appropriateness of certain hospitalizations and other medical services prior to the services being rendered. For example, precertification is used to determine whether a set of hospital and medical services is being appropriately applied to the member’s clinical condition, in accordance with criteria for medical necessity as that term is defined in the member’s benefits contract. All of our health plans have implemented precertification programs for selected medical services including surgeries, major diagnostic procedures, devices, drugs and other services to help members maximize benefits and avoid unnecessary charges or penalties.\nFormulary management:\nWe have developed formularies, which are selections of drugs based on clinical quality and effectiveness. A pharmacy and therapeutics committee of physicians uses scientific and clinical evidence to ensure that our members have access to the appropriate drug therapies and receive these therapies through proper settings.\nMedical policy:\nA medical policy committee determines our national policies and guidelines for the application of medical technologies, procedures and services. This committee is comprised of internal and external physician leaders from various specialties and areas of the country. We also work in cooperation with academic medical centers, practicing community physicians and medical specialty organizations. All guidelines and policies are reviewed at least once a year or as new published clinical evidence becomes available.\nQuality programs:\nWe are actively engaged with our hospital and physician networks to enable them to improve medical and surgical care and achieve better outcomes for our members. We endorse, encourage and incentivize hospitals and physicians to support national initiatives to improve the quality of clinical care and patient outcomes and to reduce medication errors and hospital infections.\nExternal review procedures:\nWe work with outside experts through a process of external review to provide our members scientifically and clinically, evidence-based medical care. When we receive member concerns, we have formal appeals procedures that ultimately allow coverage disputes related to medical necessity decisions under the benefits contract to be settled by independent expert physicians.\nProvider cost comparison tools:\nWe offer web-based tools that allow our members to compare cost estimates, quality accreditation data and patient reviews for common services at contracted providers and cost estimates for facility, professional and ancillary services. Members can also estimate out-of-pocket costs based on a member’s own benefit coverage, deductible and out-of-pocket maximum. We continue to work on enhancing and evolving our tools to assist members in making informed and value-based healthcare decisions. In addition, we collaborate with an external independent vendor to support employers wanting to purchase a consumer engagement solution with certain additional functionality.\nAnthem Health Guide:\nAnthem Health Guide is an educational resource that integrates the customer service experience with clinical and wellness coaching to provide easier navigation of healthcare services for our members. Anthem Health Guide provides members with education on benefit options and digital opportunities that fit member preferences, and makes recommendations for eligible clinical programs to ensure members are connected to the most appropriate care and clinical resources. By allowing members to connect with us using voice, click-to-chat, secure email and mobile technology, we enhance our ability to engage with our members.\nAnthem Whole Health Connection:\nAnthem Whole Health Connection is included when our health benefits are combined with one or more of our pharmacy, dental, vision, life, disability, behavioral health or supplemental health coverage plans and connects medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, disability, behavioral health and supplemental health clinical\n-12-\nand claims data to proactively identify health issues earlier and engage our members with their health providers in new ways to support health, lower costs and deliver a better healthcare experience.\nCare Management and Wellness Products and Programs\nWe continue to expand our suite of integrated care management programs and tools and offer the following programs, among others, which are available to our members depending on the particular plan or product in which they participate, and have been designed to increase quality and reduce medical costs for our members:\nSydney Health\nis our digital engagement platform. Sydney Health gives our members access to personalized health and wellness resources; medical, pharmacy, dental, vision, life, and disability benefits details; as well as virtual care services, all in one place.\nConditionCare\nand\nFutureMoms\nare care management and maternity management programs that serve as adjuncts to physician care. Skilled nurse professionals, with added support from our team of dietitians, social workers, pharmacists, health educators and other health professionals, help participants understand their condition, their doctor’s orders and how to become a better self-manager of their condition. We also offer members infertility consultation through our SpecialOffers@Anthem program, a comprehensive and integrated assembly of discounted health and wellness products and services from a variety of the nation’s leading retailers.\n24/7 NurseLine\noffers access to qualified, registered nurses anytime. This allows our members to make informed decisions about the appropriate level of care and avoid unnecessary worry. This program also includes a referral process to the nearest urgent care facility, a robust audio library, accessible by phone, with more than 600 health and wellness topics, as well as on-line health education topics designed to educate members about symptoms and treatment of many common health concerns.\nMyHealth Advantage\nutilizes integrated information systems and sophisticated data analytics to help our members improve their compliance with evidence-based care guidelines, providing personal care notes that alert members to potential gaps in care, enable more prudent healthcare choices and assist in the realization of member out-of-pocket cost savings. Key opportunities are also shared with physicians through Availity\n®\nat the time of membership eligibility verification. Availity\n®\nis an electronic data interchange system that allows for the exchange of health information among providers over a secure network.\nMyHealth Coach\nprovides our members with a professional guide who helps them navigate the healthcare system and make better decisions about their well-being.\nMyHealth Coach\nproactively reaches out to people who are at risk for potentially serious health issues or have complex healthcare needs. Our health coaches help participants understand and manage chronic conditions, handle any health and wellness related services they need and make smart lifestyle choices.\nHealthyLifestyles\nhelps employees transform unhealthy habits into positive ones by focusing on behaviors that can have a positive effect on their health and their employer’s financial well-being.\nHealthyLifestyles\nprograms include smoking cessation, weight management, stress management, physical activity, and diet and nutrition.\nWellbeing Coach\nprovides our members with an experienced health educator who provides counseling, tools, and support to transform unhealthy habits into positive ones, focusing on tobacco cessation or weight management.\nBehavioral Health Case Management\nis a comprehensive program supporting a wide range of members who are impacted by their behavioral health condition, including specialty areas such as eating disorders, anxiety, depression and substance abuse. The program assists members and their families with obtaining appropriate behavioral health treatment, offering community resources, providing education and telephonic support, and promoting provider collaboration.\nAutism Spectrum Disorder Program\nis a specialized case management program staffed by a dedicated team of clinicians who have been trained on the unique challenges and needs of families with a member who has a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. These clinicians provide education, information on community resources to help with care and support, guidance on the appropriate usage of benefits and assistance in exploring effective treatments, such as medical services, that may help the member and their families.\n-13-\nEmployee Assistance Programs\nprovide 24/7 telephonic support for personal and crisis events and provide resources such as counseling and referral assistance with childcare, health and wellness, financial issues, legal issues, adoption and daily living.\nHealthcare Quality Initiatives\nIncreasingly, the healthcare industry is able to define quality healthcare based on preventive health measurements, outcomes of care and optimal care management for chronic disease. A key to our success has been our ability to work with our network physicians and hospitals to improve the quality and outcomes of the healthcare services provided to our members. Our ability to promote quality medical care has been recognized by NCQA, the largest and most respected national accreditation program for managed care health plans.\nSeveral quality healthcare measures, including the Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (“HEDIS\n®\n”), have been incorporated into NCQA’s accreditation processes. HEDIS\n®\nmeasures range from preventive services, such as screening mammography and pediatric immunization, to elements of care, including decreasing the complications of diabetes, improving treatment for patients with heart disease, integration of behavioral health, and racial and ethnic stratification measurement to help close healthcare disparities.\nOur health outcomes research subsidiary, HealthCore, Inc. (“HealthCore”), generates consistent and actionable evidence to support decision making while helping to guide fresh initiatives for a range of stakeholders in the healthcare industry. By leveraging a rich array of medical and pharmacy utilization data queried from administrative claims, patient surveys, medical charts and laboratory diagnostics, among other health records, HealthCore’s multi-disciplinary research teams develop a broad spectrum of safety, clinical research trials, effectiveness, pharmacoepidemiology and health economics evidence. HealthCore’s real world evidence and comparative effectiveness research, among other data, have played roles in the product planning and development campaigns of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies and today it lists most of the leading biologics and drug manufacturers as clients or alliance partners.\nThrough our American Imaging Management, Inc. subsidiary, doing business as AIM Specialty Health (“AIM”), we promote appropriate, safe and affordable member care in the areas of imaging, sleep disorders, cardiac testing, oncology drugs and musculoskeletal procedures. These expanded specialty benefit management solutions leverage clinical expertise and technology to engage provider communities and members in the more effective and efficient use of outpatient services and to promote the most appropriate use of clinical services to improve the quality of overall healthcare delivered to our members and members of other health plans that are covered under AIM’s programs.\nThrough our subsidiary myNEXUS, Inc. (“myNEXUS”), we perform management review for home health services provided to Medicare members, with the goal of ensuring they receive appropriate, high-quality care and supporting their transition back into the home. Effective management of these services can help reduce preventable hospital admissions and readmissions, thereby improving healthcare outcomes for patients. Additionally, myNEXUS has developed programs to address healthcare quality by identifying social determinants of health needs of our members and seeking to close gaps in care through an in-home assessment. Both AIM and myNEXUS programs are examples of how we facilitate improvements in the quality of care provided to our members and promote cost-effective medical care.\nBCBSA Licenses\nWe are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive, and in certain areas, non-exclusive use of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks in assigned geographic territories. BCBSA is a national association of independent Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, the primary function of which is to promote and preserve the integrity of the BCBS names and marks, as well as provide certain coordination among the member companies. Each BCBSA licensee is an independent legal organization and is not responsible for obligations of other BCBSA member organizations. We currently have no right to market products and services using the BCBS names and marks outside of the states in which we are licensed to sell BCBS products. However, if the terms of the subscriber settlement agreement and release (“Subscriber Settlement Agreement”) that was agreed to in 2020 by the BCBSA and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees, including us (the “Blue plans”), are approved, some large national employers with self-funded plans will have a right to request a second Blue plan bid in addition to the local Blue plan. We are required to pay an annual license fee to the BCBSA based on enrollment and also to comply with various requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks. These requirements and restrictions include, among other things: minimum capital and liquidity\n-14-\nrequirements; enrollment and customer service performance requirements; participation in programs that provide portability of membership between plans; disclosures to the BCBSA relating to enrollment and financial conditions; disclosures as to the structure of the BCBS system in contracts with third parties and in public statements; plan governance requirements; cybersecurity requirements; a requirement that at least 80% (or, in the case of Blue Cross of California, substantially all) of a licensee’s annual combined local net revenue, as defined by the BCBSA, attributable to healthcare plans and related services within its service areas must be sold, marketed, administered or underwritten under the BCBS names and marks; a requirement that neither a plan nor any of its licensed affiliates may permit an entity other than a plan or a licensed affiliate to obtain control of the plan or the licensed affiliate or to acquire a substantial portion of its assets related to licensable services; governance requirements such as a requirement that we divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms; a requirement that we guarantee certain contractual and financial obligations of our licensed affiliates; and a requirement that we indemnify the BCBSA against any claims asserted against it resulting from the contractual and financial obligations of any subsidiary that serves as a fiscal intermediary providing administrative services for Medicare Parts A and B. In addition, a change of control or violation of the BCBSA ownership limitations on our capital stock, impending financial insolvency or the appointment of a trustee or receiver or the commencement of any action against us seeking our dissolution could cause a termination of our license agreements.\nWe believe that we and our licensed affiliates are currently in compliance with these standards. The standards under the license agreements may be modified in certain instances by the BCBSA. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional details on the impact if we were not to comply with these license agreements and Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies -\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation”\nof the Notes to our Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K for additional information on the Subscriber Settlement Agreement.\nRegulation\nGeneral\nOur operations are subject to comprehensive and detailed state, federal and international regulation throughout the jurisdictions in which we do business. These laws and regulations, which can vary significantly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, restrict how we conduct our businesses and result in additional burdens and costs to us. Further, federal and state laws and regulations are subject to amendments and changing interpretations in each jurisdiction. The application of these complex legal and regulatory requirements to the detailed operation of our businesses creates areas of uncertainty. In addition, there are numerous proposed healthcare laws and regulations at the federal and state levels, including single payer, Medicare for All and public option proposals, some of which could materially adversely affect our businesses if they were to be enacted.\nSupervisory agencies, including federal and state regulators and departments of health, insurance and corporation, have broad authority to:\n•\ngrant, suspend and revoke licenses to transact business;\n•\nregulate our products and services in great detail;\n•\nregulate, limit, or suspend our ability to market products, including participation in Medicare and the ACA Public Exchanges;\n•\ndetermine through a procurement process our ability to participate in certain programs, including state Medicaid programs;\n•\nretroactively adjust premium rates;\n•\nmonitor our solvency and reserve adequacy;\n•\nscrutinize our investment activities on the basis of quality, diversification and other quantitative criteria; and\n•\nimpose monetary and criminal sanctions for non-compliance with regulatory requirements.\nTo carry out these tasks, these government entities periodically examine our operations and accounts.\nThe health benefits business also may be adversely impacted by court and regulatory decisions that expand or invalidate the interpretations of existing statutes and regulations. It is uncertain whether we could recoup, through higher premiums or\n-15-\nother measures, the increased costs of mandated benefits or other increased costs caused by potential legislation, regulation or court rulings. See Part I, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19\nFederal and state governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, legislation and regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on health benefits, consumer eligibility for public programs and our cash flows for all lines of business, and introduce increased uncertainty around our cost structure. These actions, which are or have been in effect for various durations, provide, among other things:\n•\nmandates to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing (including over-the-counter testing in accordance with state and federal requirements such as California SB 510 and January 2022 federal requirements), treatment, vaccines and related services;\n•\nreforms, including waiving Medicare originating site restrictions for qualified providers of telehealth services;\n•\nfinancial support to healthcare providers, including expansion of the Medicare accelerated payment program to all providers receiving Medicare payments;\n•\nmandated expansion of premium payment terms, including the time period for which claims can be denied for lack of payment; and\n•\nmandates related to prior authorizations and payment levels to providers, additional consumer enrollment windows and an increased ability to provide telehealth services.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which was enacted in December 2020 (the “Appropriations Act”), contains a number of provisions that may have a material effect upon our business, including procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills and new mandates for continuity of care for certain patients, price comparison tools, disclosure of broker compensation, mental health parity reporting, and reporting on pharmacy benefits and drug costs. The health plan-related requirements of the Appropriations Act have varying effective dates beginning as early as December 2021, some of which have been extended since the enactment of the Appropriations Act.\nImplementation of the Appropriations Act brings with it significant oversight responsibilities by health insurers that may result in increased governmental audits, increased assertions of False Claims Act violations, and an increased risk of other litigation. Federal regulatory agencies continue to issue regulations and guidance related to the Appropriations Act.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “Rescue Plan”), which was enacted in March 2021, contains several health-related provisions that have impacted our business, including expansion of premium tax credits for our Public Exchange business and full subsidization of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) continuation coverage for those who were involuntarily terminated or had their work hours reduced. The Rescue Plan’s premium tax provisions became effective in January 2021, while the COBRA premium subsidization was effective from April 2021 through September 2021.\nState Regulation of Insurance Companies and HMOs\nOur insurance and HMO subsidiaries must obtain a certificate of authority and maintain that license in the jurisdictions in which they conduct business. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has adopted model regulations that, where adopted by states, require expanded governance practices, risk and solvency assessment reporting and the filing of periodic financial and operating reports. Most states have adopted these or similar measures to expand the scope of regulations relating to corporate governance and internal control activities of HMOs and insurance companies. Health insurers and HMOs are subject to state examination and periodic license renewal.\nIn addition, we are regulated as an insurance holding company and are subject to the insurance holding company acts of the states in which our insurance company and HMO subsidiaries are domiciled. These acts contain certain reporting requirements, as well as restrictions on transactions between an insurer or HMO and its affiliates, and may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends to our holding companies. These holding company laws and regulations\n-16-\ngenerally require registration with applicable state departments of insurance and the filing of reports describing capital structure, ownership, financial condition, certain intercompany transactions, enterprise risks, corporate governance and general business operations. State insurance holding company laws and regulations require notice or prior regulatory approval of transactions including acquisitions, material intercompany transfers of assets, guarantees and other transactions between the regulated companies and their affiliates, including parent holding companies. Applicable state insurance holding company acts also restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. “Control” is generally defined as the direct or indirect power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of a person and is presumed to exist if a person directly or indirectly owns or controls 10% or more of the voting securities of another person. Dispositions of control generally are also regulated under the state insurance holding company acts.\nThe states of domicile of our regulated subsidiaries have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs based on the Risk-Based Capital (“RBC”) For Health Organizations Model Act. These RBC requirements are intended to assess the capital adequacy of life and health insurers and HMOs, taking into account the risk characteristics of a company’s investments and products. In general, under these laws, an insurance company or HMO must submit a report of its RBC level to the insurance department or insurance commissioner of its state of domicile for each calendar year. The law requires increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as a company’s RBC declines. As of December 31, 2021, the RBC levels of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries exceeded all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. For more information on RBC capital and additional liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations–Liquidity and Capital Resources–\nCapital Resources\n,” included in Part II, Item 7 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOngoing Requirements and Changes Stemming from the ACA\nSince its enactment in 2010, the ACA has introduced new risks, regulatory challenges and uncertainties, and required changes in the way our products are designed, underwritten, priced, distributed and administered. The ACA has evolved and various legal challenges since its enactment introduced increased uncertainty to our business. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion and dismissed the latest legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, leaving the law intact. We expect that most of the ACA will remain in place and continue to significantly impact our business operations and results of operations, including pricing, minimum medical loss ratios (“MLRs”) and the geographies in which our products are available; however, federal regulatory agencies continue to modify regulations and guidance related to the ACA and our businesses more broadly. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. CMS is also proposing changes to its program that audits data submitted under the risk adjustment programs in a way that would increase financial recoveries from plans. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as any further developments or judicial rulings occur.\nCertain significant provisions of the ACA include, among others:\n•\nProhibitions against lifetime limits, certain annual limits, member cost-sharing on specified preventive benefits and pre-existing condition exclusions.\n•\nMandated coverage requirements and benefits associated with commercial health insurance.\n•\nThe creation of Public Exchanges for individuals and small group customers.\n•\nEstablishment of minimum MLR thresholds by line of business for the Commercial market (which may be subject to more restrictive MLR thresholds under state regulations, such as those in New York). Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D prescription drug plans that do not meet the mandated threshold will have to pay a minimum MLR rebate, will be subject to restricted enrollment if MLR is below the threshold for three consecutive years, and are subject to contract termination if the plan’s MLR is below the threshold for five consecutive years. In addition, state Medicaid programs are required to set managed care capitation rates such that a minimum MLR is projected to be achieved; however, states are not required to collect remittances if the minimum MLR is not achieved.\nApproximately 53.6% and 20.7% of our premium revenue and medical membership, respectively, were subject to the minimum MLR regulations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021. Approximately 54.8% and 20.2% of our premium revenue and medical membership, respectively, were subject to the minimum MLR regulations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n-17-\n•\nThe creation of an incentive payment program for Medicare Advantage plans. CMS developed the Medicare Advantage Star ratings system, which awards between 1.0 and 5.0 Stars to Medicare Advantage plans based on performance in several categories, including quality of care and customer service. The Star ratings are used by CMS to award quality-based bonus payments to plans that receive a rating of 4.0 or higher. The methodology and measures included in the Star ratings system can be modified by CMS annually. As of December 31, 2021, all of our Medicare Advantage plans have received a rating of 3.0 or higher.\n•\nFederal review requirements for unreasonable premium rate increases for Individual and small group products, or where the state does not have an effective rate review system.\n•\nThe establishment of the non-deductible Health Insurance Provider Fee (“HIP Fee”), which was permanently eliminated effective January 1, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $1,570 as selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee.\n•\nImplementation of a Medicare Advantage payment formula, which prevents reimbursement rates from increasing as much as otherwise would be expected.\nIn general, the Individual market risk pool that includes Public Exchange markets has become less healthy since its inception in 2014 and continues to exhibit risk volatility. In addition, insurers have faced uncertainties related to federal government funding for various ACA programs. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals. Any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, or other assumptions utilized in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position and cash flows. We make adjustments to our premium rates and participation footprint on an ongoing basis, based on our experience in Public Exchange markets to date, and continue to evaluate the performance of our Public Exchange plans. In 2021, we made the decision to modestly expand our participation in the Individual ACA-compliant market for 2022 after also expanding in 2021. As a result, for 2022 we are offering Individual ACA-compliant products in 122 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate, in comparison to 103 of 143 rating regions in 2021. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics.\nIn a separate development, in August 2020, the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the federal government’s unambiguous obligation to make unpaid cost sharing reduction (“CSR”) payments to qualified health plans, but held that a plan’s payments should be reduced by the amount of additional premium tax credits an issuer received as a result of the government’s termination of CSR payments. We recognized the net premium impact of the CSR recoveries for 2017 in the fourth quarter of 2021. We will continue to review and evaluate the impact of this litigation as any further developments or judicial rulings occur.\nDrug Benefit and Pharmacy Benefit Manager Regulation\nPharmacy benefit managers are regulated at both the federal and state levels and must comply with federal and state statutes and regulations governing labeling, packaging, advertising and adulteration of prescription drugs, dispensing of controlled substances and licensing. In recent years the federal government has banned certain business practices, including “gag clauses,” which prohibited pharmacists from informing patients when a lower cost drug was available as a substitute, and “clawbacks,” which occurred when pharmacy benefit managers sought to recoup the difference between the reimbursed cost of the drug and the patient’s copay when the drug itself was less expensive than the copay paid by the patient. Regulation in the states varies dramatically and ranges from licensure of PBMs as third-party administrators, licensure specifically as a pharmacy benefit manager, and licensure accompanied by additional disclosures and limitations of business practices to varying degrees. The NAIC finalized a PBM model law that, if adopted widely, could result in a more standardized approach to PBM regulation in the states in the future. Additionally, in December 2020, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand an Arkansas law regulating PBMs, which could be a precursor to greater state regulation of PBMs in the future. In June 2021, the NAIC announced a proposed white paper addressing PBMs and examining the impact of this Supreme Court case on its model law, which could result in expansion of the NAIC model law and additional regulatory oversight, which could materially affect current industry practices and our PBM business.\nA number of proposals are being considered at the federal and state levels that would increase regulation of drug benefits and pharmacy benefit managers. Such proposals under consideration include (1) regulation of rebates from drug\n-18-\nmanufacturers that would require rebate dollars to be applied at the point-of-sale, (2) federal policy changes to set the prices for a subset of drugs covered under the Medicare program, (3) reforms to the Medicare drug benefit, such as beneficiary cost-sharing changes that aim to lower consumer costs, (4) attempts at both the federal and state levels to prohibit the use of spread pricing contracts in both the Commercial and Medicaid markets, and (5) electronic prior authorizations of drugs. These reforms have the potential to have broad impacts on our PBM business and could materially adversely affect our business if they are enacted.\nPrivacy, Confidentiality and Data Standards Regulation\nThe federal Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (“HIPAA”) and the administrative simplification provisions of HIPAA impose a number of requirements on covered entities (including insurers, HMOs, group health plans, providers and clearinghouses) and their business associates relating to the use, disclosure and safeguarding of protected health information. These requirements include uniform standards of common electronic healthcare transactions; privacy and security regulations; and unique identifier rules for employers, health plans and providers.\nAlso, the Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (“HITECH”) Act provisions of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 and corresponding implementing regulations have imposed additional requirements on the use and disclosure of protected health information such as additional breach notification and reporting requirements, contracting requirements for HIPAA business associate agreements, strengthened enforcement mechanisms and increased penalties for HIPAA violations. Federal consumer protection laws may also apply in some instances to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information.\nThe federal Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act generally places restrictions on the disclosure of non-public information to non-affiliated third parties, and requires financial institutions, including insurers, to provide customers with notice regarding how their non-public personal information is used, including an opportunity to “opt out” of certain disclosures. State departments of insurance and certain federal agencies adopted implementing regulations as required by federal law.\nThe Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 encourages organizations to share cyber threat indicators with the federal government and, among other things, directed HHS to develop a set of voluntary cybersecurity best practices for organizations in the healthcare industry, which were issued in 2018.\nIn addition, Public Exchanges are required to adhere to privacy and security standards with respect to personally identifiable information and to impose privacy and security standards that are at least as protective as those the Public Exchange has implemented for itself on insurers offering plans through the Public Exchanges and their designated downstream entities, including pharmacy benefit managers and other business associates. These standards may differ from, and be more stringent than, HIPAA.\nFurthermore, states have begun enacting more comprehensive privacy laws and regulations addressing consumer rights to data protection or transparency that may affect our privacy and security practices, such as state laws like the California Privacy Rights Act of 2020 that govern the use, disclosure and protection of member data and impose additional breach notification requirements. The NAIC is planning potential revisions to one or more of its privacy model acts, which could expand consumer privacy rights. State consumer protection laws may also apply to privacy and security practices related to personally identifiable information, including information related to consumers and care providers. Complying with conflicting cybersecurity regulations and varying enforcement philosophies, which may differ from state to state, requires significant resources and may materially and adversely affect our ability to standardize our products and services across state lines.\nFederal regulations have been finalized in the following areas that will materially impact our operations:\n•\nFederal regulations on data interoperability that will require claims data to be made available to third parties unaffiliated with us; and\n•\nFederal regulations requiring hospitals and health insurers to publish negotiated prices for services, including the health plan price transparency regulations issued in October 2020 by the U.S. Departments of Health and Human Services, Labor and Treasury (the “Health Plan Transparency Rule”).\n-19-\nBeginning in July 2022, the Health Plan Transparency Rule will require us to disclose, on a monthly basis, detailed pricing information regarding negotiated rates for all covered items and services between the plan or issuer and in-network providers and historical payments to, and billed charges from, out-of-network providers. Additionally, beginning in 2023, we will be required to make available to members personalized out-of-pocket cost information and the underlying negotiated rates for 500 covered healthcare items and services, including prescription drugs. In 2024, this requirement will expand to all items and services.\nFederal regulations were proposed that would have expanded the final regulation on data interoperability to require health insurers to build new application programming interfaces to afford patients access to their health information and require electronic prior authorizations for Commercial Qualified Health Plans in the federal exchange, as well as Medicaid and CHIP fee-for-service and managed care organizations. These regulations were withdrawn in early 2021 and are expected to materially impact our operations if re-proposed in substantially similar form.\nEmployee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974\nThe provision of services to certain employee welfare benefit plans is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), a complex set of laws and regulations subject to interpretation and enforcement by the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Labor. ERISA regulates certain aspects of the relationships between us, the employers that maintain employee welfare benefit plans subject to ERISA and participants in such plans. Some of our administrative services and other activities may also be subject to regulation under ERISA. In addition, certain states require licensure or registration of companies providing third-party claims administration services for benefit plans. We provide a variety of products and services to employee welfare benefit plans that are covered by ERISA. Plans subject to ERISA can also be subject to state laws, and the question of whether and to what extent ERISA preempts a state law has been, and will continue to be, interpreted by many courts.\nGuaranty Fund Assessments\nUnder insolvency or guaranty association laws in most states, insurance companies and HMOs can be assessed for amounts paid by guaranty funds for policyholder losses incurred when an insurance company or HMO becomes insolvent. Most state insolvency or guaranty association laws currently provide for assessments based upon the amount of premiums received on insurance underwritten within such state (with a minimum amount payable even if no premium is received). Under many of these guaranty association laws, assessments are made retrospectively. Some states permit insurers or HMOs to recover assessments paid through full or partial premium tax offsets or through future policyholder surcharges. The amount and timing of any future assessments cannot be predicted with certainty; however, future assessments are likely to occur.\nInternational Regulation\nWe have various international subsidiaries, which provide back-office services, that are subject to different, and sometimes more stringent, legal and regulatory requirements, which vary widely by jurisdiction.\nIn addition, our non-U.S. operations are subject to U.S. laws regulating the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, including but not limited to, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and corresponding foreign laws governing anti-bribery, anti-corruption and anti-money laundering.\nHuman Capital\nAt Anthem, it starts with our culture, and our associates are critical to fulfilling our purpose of improving the health of humanity.

We offer various instructor-led and virtual instructor-led programs and maintain a vast curriculum of relevant, on-demand learning and development resources.\nHealth & Wellbeing\nWe have the privilege of touching the lives of millions of people each day, and for us, this starts with the health of our own associates. To improve the health and wellbeing of our associates, we offer a comprehensive compensation package, including competitive salaries, a 401(k) plan and medical, dental, vision and disability coverage. In addition, we offer our associates wellness and behavioral programs and tools to help them get and stay healthy and more easily manage their work and personal lives.

    "text": "In evaluating our business, the risks described below, as well as the other information contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, should be carefully considered. Any one or more of such risks could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and stock price and could cause our actual results of operations and financial condition to vary materially from past or anticipated future results of operations and financial condition. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect us.\nBUSINESS RISKS\nThe outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic and measures taken to prevent its spread are adversely affecting our business in a number of ways, and we are unable to predict the full extent of those impacts on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations, but the impact could be material.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve, and the impact of COVID-19, and the actions taken to contain its spread or address its impact, have adversely impacted our business and could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results in the future. The extent of this impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time, including, but not limited to, the transmission rate, duration and spread of the outbreak, its severity, the emergence of variants of the virus which could be more contagious, more severe or less responsive to treatment or vaccines, the extent and effectiveness of the actions taken to contain the spread of the virus and address its impacts, including widespread availability of vaccines, the exercise of emergency powers by governments, and how quickly and to what extent normal economic and operating conditions can resume. Factors that could negatively impact our ability to operate successfully, or that could otherwise materially adversely impact and disrupt our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nContinued increases in healthcare costs due to higher utilization rates of medical facilities and services, medical expenses and other increases in associated hospital and pharmaceutical costs, as well as COVID-19 related testing, treatment, and the administration of vaccines and other therapeutics. We continue to offer our members expanded benefit coverage, such as providing coverage for COVID-19 testing (including over-the-counter testing in accordance with state and federal requirements) and vaccine administration, and governmental action has required, and may continue to require, us to provide additional coverage. In addition, we may experience an increase in medical care costs as people seek care that was deferred during the pandemic, or during periods of increased infection, and individuals with chronic conditions may require additional care resulting from missed treatments.\n•\nDecreased predictability of Medicare and Medicaid rates due to changes in utilization of medical facilities and services, medical expenses and other costs as a result of the impact of COVID-19. We experienced rate adjustments from certain state Medicaid regulators in 2021 in response to decreased utilization of medical facilities and services, and we may experience further adjustments in the future with regard to current and prior year rates.\n•\nIncreased estimation uncertainty on our claims liability due to the impact of COVID-19 on healthcare utilization and medical claims submission.\n•\nA reduction in enrollment in our health benefits, products and services or a continued change in membership mix to less profitable lines of business as a result of reductions in workforce by existing customers and other impacts of an economic downturn.\n•\nCash flow volatility or shortfalls caused by an increase in delayed, delinquent or non-collectable payments from customers and government payers.\n•\nReductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees continue to work from home or otherwise are impacted by COVID-19. The majority of our workforce continues to work remotely, which may exacerbate certain risks to our business, including increased risk of cybersecurity attacks, phishing and unauthorized dissemination of sensitive, proprietary or confidential information.\n-23-\n•\nDisruptions in our normal business operations due to disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including communications, financial services and supply chains.\n•\nLoss of functionality due to the disruption of services provided to us by third-party vendors, including due to financial, staffing or supply chain difficulties.\n•\nDisruption and volatility in the financial markets, which may cause a decrease in the value of our investments, increased cost of capital or a downgrade in our credit ratings.\nIf we fail to appropriately predict, price for and manage healthcare costs, the profitability of our products and services could decline, which could materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur profitability depends in large part on accurately predicting and pricing healthcare costs and on our ability to manage future healthcare costs through medical management, product design, negotiation of favorable provider contracts and underwriting criteria. Total healthcare costs are affected by the number of individual services rendered, the cost of each service and the type of service rendered. Numerous factors affecting the cost of healthcare may adversely affect our ability to predict and manage healthcare costs, as well as our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. These factors include, among others, changes in healthcare practices, demographic characteristics including the aging population, medical cost inflation, the introduction of new technologies, drugs and treatments, increased cost of individual services, increases in the cost and number of prescription drugs, clusters of high cost cases, increased use of services, including due to natural catastrophes or other large-scale medical emergencies, epidemics or pandemics such as COVID-19, new treatment guidelines, new mandated benefits (such as the expansion of essential benefits coverage) and changes to other regulations impacting our business.\nRelatively small differences between predicted and actual medical costs or utilization rates as a percentage of premium revenues can result in significant changes in our results of operations. Generally, our premiums on Commercial policies and Medicaid contracts are fixed for a 12-month period and may be determined based on data from several months prior to the commencement of the premium period. Our revenue on Medicare policies is based on bids submitted to CMS six months prior to the start of the contract year. Accordingly, the costs we incur in excess of our benefit cost projections generally are not recovered in the contract year through higher premiums. Existing Medicaid contract rates are often established by the applicable state, and our actual costs may exceed those rates. Although we base our Commercial premiums, our Medicare and Medicaid bids, and our acceptance of state-established Medicaid rates on our estimates of future medical costs over the fixed contract period, many factors, including those discussed above, may cause actual costs to exceed those estimated and reflected in premiums and bids.\nAlthough federal and state premium and risk adjustment mechanisms could help offset health benefit costs in excess of our projections if our assumptions utilized in setting our premium rates are significantly different than actual results, our results of operations and financial condition could still be adversely affected. The reserves that we establish for health insurance policy benefits and other contractual rights and benefits are based upon assumptions concerning a number of factors, including trends in healthcare costs, expenses, general economic conditions and other factors. To the extent the actual claims experience is unfavorable as compared to our underlying assumptions, our incurred losses would increase and future earnings could be adversely affected.\nIn addition to the challenge of managing healthcare costs, we face pressure to contain premium rates. Our customers may renegotiate their contracts to seek to contain their costs or may move to a competitor to obtain more favorable premiums. Further, federal and state regulatory agencies may restrict or prevent entirely our ability to implement changes in premium rates. A limitation on our ability to increase or maintain our premium or reimbursement levels or a significant loss of membership resulting from our need to increase or maintain premium or reimbursement levels could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, based on our experience in Public Exchange markets to date, we have made adjustments to our premium rates and geographic participation (including our modest expansion in the Public Exchange markets in 2022), and we will continue to evaluate the performance of our Public Exchange plans, the future viability of the Public Exchanges and availability of federal subsidies, and may make further adjustments to our rates and participation going forward. These factors may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations if premiums are not adequate or do not appropriately reflect the acuity of these individuals. Any variation from our expectations regarding acuity, enrollment levels, adverse selection, or\n-24-\nother assumptions utilized in setting premium rates could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial position, and cash flows.\nA significant reduction in the enrollment in our health benefits programs or PBM products or services, particularly in states where we have large regional concentrations, could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nA significant reduction in the number of enrollees in our health benefits programs or PBM products or services could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Factors that could contribute to a reduction in enrollment include: reductions in workforce by existing customers; a general economic upturn that results in fewer individuals being eligible for Medicaid programs; the end of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification for Medicaid recipients in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which will likely result in a reduction in our Medicaid membership; a general economic downturn that results in business failures and high unemployment rates; employers no longer offering certain healthcare coverage as an employee benefit or electing to offer coverage on a voluntary, employee-funded basis; participation on Public Exchanges; federal and state regulatory changes; failure to obtain new customers or retain existing customers; premium increases and benefit changes; our exit from a specific market; negative publicity and news coverage; and failure to attain or maintain nationally recognized accreditations.\nThe states in which we operate that have the largest concentrations of revenues include California, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, New York, Ohio, Texas and Virginia. Due to this concentration of business in these states, we are exposed to potential losses resulting from the risk of state-specific or regional economic downturns impacting these states. If any such negative economic conditions do not improve, we may experience a reduction in existing and new business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nA cyber-attack or other privacy or data security incident could result in an unauthorized disclosure of sensitive or confidential information, cause a loss of data, disrupt our operations, give rise to remediation or other expenses, expose us to liability under federal and state laws, and subject us to litigation and investigations, which could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAs part of our normal operations, we collect, process, retain and transmit large amounts of sensitive and confidential information, including, among other information, corporate strategy, customer and employee information. Some of the data we process, store and transmit is outside of the U.S. We are subject to a variety of continuously evolving federal, state and international laws and rules regarding the use and disclosure of certain sensitive or confidential information, including HIPAA, the HITECH Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and numerous state laws governing personal information. Our facilities and systems, and those of our third-party service providers, are regularly the target of, and may be vulnerable to, cyber-attacks, security breaches, acts of vandalism, computer viruses, misplaced or lost data, programming and/or human errors, negligent or wrongful conduct by employees or others with permitted access to our systems and information or other threats.\nWe have been, and may in the future be, subject to litigation and governmental investigations related to cyber-attacks and security breaches, which could divert the attention of management from the operation of our business, result in reputational damage and have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. While we have contingency plans and insurance coverage for potential liabilities of this nature, they may not be sufficient to cover all claims and liabilities.\nWe cannot ensure that we will be able to identify, prevent or contain the effects of cyber-attacks or other cybersecurity risks that bypass our security measures or disrupt our information technology systems or business. We have security technologies, processes and procedures in place to protect against cybersecurity risks and security breaches. However, hardware, software or applications we develop or procure from third parties may contain defects in design, manufacturer defects or other problems that could unexpectedly compromise information security. In addition, because the techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable, disrupt or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, are becoming increasingly sophisticated, and may not immediately produce signs of intrusion, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques, timely discover or counter them or implement adequate preventative measures. Viruses, worms or other malicious software programs may be used to attack our systems or otherwise exploit any security vulnerabilities, and such security attacks may cause system disruptions or shutdowns, or may cause personal information or proprietary or confidential\n-25-\ninformation to be disclosed, misappropriated or compromised. This risk is heightened due to the increased number of our employees working from home. As a result, cybersecurity and the continued development and enhancement of our controls, processes and practices designed to protect our systems, computers, software, data and networks from attack, damage and unauthorized access remain a priority for us.\nNoncompliance with any privacy or security laws and regulations, or any security breach, cyber-attack or cybersecurity breach, and any incident involving the misappropriation, theft, loss or other unauthorized disclosure or use of, or access to, sensitive or confidential information, whether by us or by one of our third-party service providers, could require us to expend significant resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures and to remediate any damage. In addition, this could negatively affect our operations, cause system disruptions, damage our reputation, cause membership losses and contract breaches, and could also result in regulatory enforcement actions, material fines and penalties, litigation or other actions that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThere are various risks associated with participating in Medicare and Medicaid programs, including dependence upon government funding and the timing of payments, compliance with government contracts and increased regulatory oversight.\nWe contract with various federal and state agencies, including CMS, to provide managed healthcare services, such as Medicare Advantage, Medicare Part D, Medicare Supplement, Medicaid, TANF, SPD, LTSS, CHIP, Medicaid expansion programs and various specialty programs, products and services. We also provide various administrative services for other entities offering medical and/or prescription drug plans to their Medicaid or Medicare eligible members through our affiliated companies, and we offer employer group waiver plans which provide medical and/or prescription drug coverage to retirees. We also participate in programs in several states for the care of dual-eligible members. Regulatory reform initiatives or changes in existing laws or regulations applicable to these programs, or their interpretations, are difficult to predict and could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nRevenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments, and base premium rates paid by each state or federal agency differ depending upon a combination of factors such as defined upper payment limits, a member’s health status, age, gender, county or region, benefit mix, member eligibility category and risk scores. Future rates may be affected by continued government efforts to contain costs as well as federal and state budgetary constraints, and certain state contracts are subject to cancellation in the event of the unavailability of state funds. Additionally, ongoing CMS system changes related to the data it uses to calculate risk scores in the Medicare Advantage program may impact our federal funding. If the federal government or any state in which we operate were to decrease rates paid to us, pay us less than the amount necessary to keep pace with our cost trends, cancel our contracts retroactively or seek an adjustment to previously negotiated rates, it could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, various states’ MMPs are still subject to uncertainty surrounding payment rates and other requirements, which could affect where we seek to participate in these programs. An unexpected reduction in payments, inadequate government funding or significantly delayed payments for these programs may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOther potential risks associated with Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D plans include increased medical or pharmaceutical costs, data corrections identified as a result of ongoing auditing and monitoring activities, potential uncollectability of receivables resulting from processing and/or verifying enrollment, inadequacy of underwriting assumptions, inability to receive and process correct information (including inability due to systems issues by the federal government, the applicable state government or us), uncollectability of premiums from members and limited enrollment periods. Actual results may be materially different than our assumptions and estimates and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. Finally, there is the possibility that the Medicare Advantage program could be significantly impacted by future legislation.\nOur contracts with CMS and state governmental agencies contain certain provisions regarding data submission, risk adjustment, provider network and directory maintenance, quality measures, claims payment, timely and accurate processing of appeals and grievances, oversight of service providers, encounter data, continuity of care, call center performance and other requirements specific to federal and state program regulations. We have been subject in the past, and may again be in the future, to administrative actions, fines, penalties, liquidated damages or retrospective adjustments in payments made to our health plans as a result of a failure to comply with those requirements, which has impacted and in the future could impact\n-26-\nour profitability. Due to decreased utilization of medical facilities and services as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced retroactive rate adjustments by certain state Medicaid agencies, and rate adjustments may continue in the future. As members have accessed care during the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced increased difficulty obtaining provider information required by CMS and state governmental agencies and, as a result, may have difficulty meeting these quality measures. In addition, we could be required to file a corrective plan of action with additional penalties for noncompliance, which could have a negative impact on future membership enrollment levels. Further, our existing CMS or state Medicaid contracts have not always been renewed, we have not always been awarded new contracts as a result of the competitive procurement process, and in some cases we have lost members under existing contracts as a result of a post-award challenge by unsuccessful bidders, each of which could take place again in the future and have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nFurther, the Star Rating System utilized by CMS to evaluate Medicare Advantage Plans may have a significant effect on our revenue, as higher-rated plans tend to experience increased enrollment and plans with a Star rating of 4.0 or higher are eligible for quality-based bonus payments and can market to and enroll members year-round. If we do not maintain or continue to improve our Star ratings, fail to meet or exceed our competitors’ Star ratings, or if quality-based bonus payments are reduced or eliminated, we may experience a negative impact on our revenues and the benefits that our plans can offer, which could materially and adversely affect the marketability of our plans, our membership levels, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. Similarly, if we fail to meet or exceed any performance standards imposed by state Medicaid programs in which we participate, we may not receive performance-based bonus payments or may incur penalties.\nIn addition, our failure to comply with federal and state healthcare laws and regulations applicable to our participation in Medicaid and Medicare programs, including those directed at preventing fraud, abuse and discrimination, could result in investigations, litigation, fines, restrictions on, or exclusions from, program participation, or the imposition of corporate integrity agreements or other agreements with a federal or state governmental agency, any of which could adversely impact our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are periodically subject to government audits, including CMS Risk Adjustment Data Validation (“RADV”) audits of our Medicare Advantage Plans to validate diagnostic data, patient claims and financial reporting, and audits of our Medicare Part D plans by the Medicare Part D Recovery Audit Contractor (“RAC”), as well as state Medicaid RAC programs. These audits could result in significant adjustments in payments made to our health plans, which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations. If we fail to report and correct errors discovered through our own auditing procedures or during a RADV or RAC audit, or otherwise fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations, we could be subject to fines, civil penalties or other sanctions, which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to participate in these programs, and on our financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nOur Medicare and Medicaid contracts are also subject to various MLR rules, including minimum MLR thresholds, rebate requirements and audits, which could adversely affect our membership and revenues if any of our state Medicare or Medicaid plans do not meet an applicable minimum MLR threshold. If a Medicare Advantage, MMP or Medicare Part D contract pays minimum MLR rebates for three consecutive years, it will become ineligible to participate in open enrollment. If a Medicare Advantage or Medicare Part D contract pays such rebates for five consecutive years, it will be terminated by CMS.\nA change in our healthcare product mix may impact our profitability.\nOur healthcare products that involve greater potential risk generally tend to be more profitable than administrative services products and those healthcare products where the employer groups assume the underwriting risks. Individuals and small employer groups are more likely to purchase our higher-risk healthcare products because such purchasers are generally unable or unwilling to bear greater liability for healthcare expenditures. Typically, government-sponsored programs also involve our higher-risk healthcare products. A shift of enrollees from more profitable products to less profitable products could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIf we fail to develop and maintain satisfactory relationships with hospitals, physicians, PBM service providers and other healthcare providers, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected.\nOur profitability is dependent in part upon our ability to contract on favorable terms with hospitals, physicians, PBM service providers and supply chain partners and other healthcare providers. Healthcare providers may elect not to contract with us, and the failure to secure or maintain cost-effective healthcare provider contracts on competitive terms may result in a\n-27-\nloss of membership or higher medical costs, which could adversely affect our business. In addition, consolidation among healthcare providers, ACO practice management companies, and other organizational structures that physicians, hospitals and other care providers choose, as well as the ability of larger employers to contract directly with providers, may change the way that these providers interact with us and change the competitive landscape. Such organizations or groups of physicians may compete directly with us, which may impact our relationship with these providers or affect the way that we price our products and services and estimate our costs and may require us to incur costs to change our operations, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, price transparency initiatives, such as the Health Plan Transparency Rule, may impact our ability to obtain or maintain favorable contract terms.\nOur inability to contract with providers, or if providers attempt to use their market position to negotiate more favorable contracts or place us at a competitive disadvantage, or the inability of providers to provide adequate care, could adversely affect our business. In addition, we do not have contracts with all providers that render services to our members and, as a result, may not have a pre-established agreement about the amount of compensation those out-of-network providers will accept for the services they render, which can result in significant litigation or arbitration proceedings, or provider attempts to obtain payment from our members for the difference between the amount we have paid and the amount they have charged.\nWe are dependent on the success of our relationships with third parties for various services and functions.\nWe contract with various third parties to perform certain functions and services and provide us with certain information technology systems. Certain of these third parties provide us with significant portions of our business infrastructure and operating requirements. For example, a couple of vendors provide us with a wide range of technology infrastructure services, including end user (help desk and field support), data center, mainframe, storage and database services, certain cloud infrastructure and multi-cloud management services, and we are subject to the risks of any operational failure, termination or other restraints in these arrangements. We could become overly dependent on key vendors, which could cause us to lose core competencies. A termination of our agreements with, or disruption in the performance of, one or more of these service providers could result in service disruptions or unavailability, reduced service quality and effectiveness, increased or duplicative costs or an inability to meet our obligations to our customers. In addition, we may also have to seek alternative service providers, which may be unavailable or only available on less favorable contract terms. Any of these outcomes could adversely affect our business, reputation, cash flows, financial condition and operating results.\nOur PBM services business in particular would be adversely affected if we are unable to contract on favorable terms with third-party vendors, including pharmaceutical manufacturers. We delegate certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CVS Health pursuant to the CVS PBM Agreement. If CVS Health fails to provide PBM services as contractually required, we may not be able to meet the full demands of our customers, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation and results of operations. For additional information on the CVS PBM Agreement, see “Business — Product and Service Descriptions,” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nThe failure to effectively maintain and upgrade our information systems, or the availability and integrity of our data, could adversely affect our business.\nOur business depends significantly on effective information systems, and we have many different information systems for our various businesses, including those that we have acquired as a result of our merger and acquisition activities. Our information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology, emerging cybersecurity risks and threats, changing customer preferences, evolving industry and regulatory standards and legal requirements, including as a result of the ACA, the Health Plan Transparency Rule, the Appropriations Act and proposed federal data interoperability regulations. In addition, we may from time to time obtain significant portions of our systems-related or other services or facilities from independent third parties, which may make our operations vulnerable if such third parties fail to perform adequately.\nFailure to adequately implement and maintain effective and efficient information systems with sufficiently advanced technological capabilities, or failure to efficiently and effectively consolidate our information systems to eliminate redundant or obsolete applications, could result in investigations, audits, fines and penalties, competitive and cost disadvantages to us compared to our competitors and a diversion of management’s time and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The volume of health care data generated and the uses of this data, including\n-28-\nelectronic health records, are rapidly expanding. Our ability to develop, implement, price and support new and existing products and services depends on the integrity of this data. If the information we rely upon to run our business were found to be inaccurate or unreliable or if we fail to adequately maintain our information systems and data integrity effectively, we could experience problems in determining medical cost estimates and establishing appropriate pricing and reserves, have disputes with customers and providers, face regulatory problems, including sanctions and penalties, incur increases in operating expenses or suffer other adverse consequences, including a decrease in membership.\nLarge-scale medical emergencies, natural disasters, war, terrorism, political events, civil unrest and global climate change may have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nNatural disasters, war, terrorism, political events, civil unrest, global climate change and other similar occurrences could create large-scale medical emergencies or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. Large-scale medical emergencies can take many forms and can cause widespread illness and death and have other far-reaching impact. For example, the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic has caused illness, deaths, quarantines, business and school shutdowns, reductions in business activity, travel and financial transactions, unemployment, inflation, labor shortages, supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability. In addition, federal and state law enforcement officials have issued warnings about potential terrorist activity involving biological and other weapons, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and the potential for a widespread pandemic of influenza or other illness coupled with the lack of availability of appropriate preventative medicines could have a significant impact on the health of the population of widespread areas. If the United States were to experience widespread bioterrorism or other attacks, large-scale natural disasters or civil unrest in our concentrated coverage areas or an epidemic or pandemic such as the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, our covered medical expenses could rise, our operations could be interrupted and we could experience a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations or, in the event of extreme circumstances, our viability could be threatened. Furthermore, global climate change could result in certain types of natural disasters occurring more frequently or with more intense effects, and may have a long-term effect on general economic conditions and the healthcare or pharmacy industry in particular, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. For additional information, see the risk factor above describing the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND PUBLIC POLICY RISKS\nWe are subject to significant government regulation, and changes or proposed changes in the regulation of our business by federal and state regulators may adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations and the market price of our securities.\nWe are subject to significant state and federal regulation associated with many aspects of our business, including, but not limited to, licensing, premiums, marketing activities, provider contracting, access and payment standards, and corporate governance and financial reporting matters, as described in greater detail in Part I, Item 1 “Business—Regulation” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Further, the integration into our business of entities that we acquire, or the expansion of our business into new businesses or jurisdictions, may affect the way in which existing laws and rules apply to us, including by subjecting us to laws and rules that did not previously apply to us.\nNew or changed laws, rules, regulations or judicial interpretation, application or enforcement thereof could force us to change how we conduct our business, affect the products and services we offer (and where we offer them), restrict revenue and enrollment growth, increase our costs, including operating, healthcare technology and administrative costs, restrict our ability to obtain new product approvals and implement changes in premium rates and require enhancements to our compliance infrastructure and internal controls environment, which could adversely impact our business and results of operations. In addition, legislative and/or regulatory policies or proposals that seek to manage the healthcare industry or otherwise impact our business may cause the market price of our securities to decrease, even if such policies or proposals never become effective. In particular, further regulations and modifications to the ACA could impact the market for our products, federal government funding for various ACA programs, the regulations applicable to us and the fees and taxes payable by us and otherwise affect our business and future operations, some of which may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations.\n-29-\nWe are required to obtain and maintain insurance and other regulatory approvals to market certain of our products and services, to increase prices for certain regulated products and services and to consummate some of our acquisitions and dispositions. Delays in obtaining or failure to obtain or maintain these approvals, as well as future regulatory action by state or federal authorities, could have a material adverse effect on the profitability or marketability of our health benefits or managed care products or on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For example, requirements in the Health Plan Transparency Rule and the Appropriations Act including the price comparison tool and other requirements have the potential to increase healthcare costs and our operating costs in order to comply, and also may impact provider negotiations and market pricing. In addition, changes in government regulations or policies that apply to government-sponsored programs such as Medicare and Medicaid including, among other things, reimbursement levels, eligibility and recertification requirements, benefit coverage requirements and additional governmental participation, could also adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations. The annual recertification process for Medicaid recipients has been temporarily suspended in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the end of this suspension will likely result in a reduction in our Medicaid membership.\nIn addition, where states allow certain programs to expire or have not opted for Medicaid expansion under the ACA, we could experience reduced Medicaid enrollment and reduced growth opportunities. If future modifications to laws and regulations significantly reduce Medicaid enrollment, our Medicaid business will be negatively impacted.\nWe have experienced assessments in the past under state or federal insolvency or guaranty association laws applicable to insurance companies, HMOs and other payers, and may experience assessments in the future if, for example, premiums established by other companies for their health insurance products, including certain long-term care products, are inadequate to cover their costs. Any such assessment could expose us to the risk of paying a portion of an impaired or insolvent insurance company’s claims through state guaranty associations. We are not currently able to estimate our potential financial obligations, losses, or the availability of offsets associated with potential guaranty association assessments; however, any significant increase in guaranty association assessments could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe expect state legislatures will continue to focus on healthcare delivery and financing issues, including actions to reduce or limit increases to premium payments, provider billing protections, greater access to care and broader reforms of health insurance markets. State ballot initiatives can also be put to voters that could materially impair our operating environment and have a material adverse impact on our business, cash flows, operations or financial condition.\nAdditionally, Congress has considered, and may consider in the future, various forms of managed care reform legislation which, if adopted, could fundamentally alter the treatment of coverage decisions under ERISA and other laws and could increase our costs, expose us to expanded liability or require us to revise the ways in which we conduct business. There have been legislative attempts to limit ERISA’s preemptive effect on state laws and litigants’ ability to seek damages beyond the benefits offered under their plans. If adopted, such limitations could increase our liability exposure, permit greater state regulation of our operations, and expand the scope of damages, including punitive damages, litigants could be awarded.\nWe are subject to various risks associated with our international operations.\nAs we expand and operate our business outside of the U.S., we are presented with different challenges, including challenges in adapting to new markets, languages, business, labor and cultural practices and regulatory environments. Adapting to these challenges could require us to devote significant senior management attention and other resources. If we are unable to successfully manage our international operations, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected. In the future, we may acquire or operate new businesses outside of the U.S., increasing our exposure to these risks.\nOur subsidiaries that operate internationally are also subject to regulation in the jurisdictions where they are organized or conduct business, including regulations related to, among other things, local and cross-border taxation, intellectual property, investment, management control, labor, anti-fraud, anti-corruption and privacy and data protection, which vary by jurisdiction. In addition, we are subject to U.S. laws that regulate the conduct and activities of U.S.-based businesses operating abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. Violations of these laws and regulations could result in fines, criminal sanctions against us, our officers or employees, restrictions or outright prohibitions on the conduct of our business and significant reputational harm.\n-30-\nWe face risks related to litigation.\nWe are, and may in the future be, a party to a variety of legal actions that may affect our business, such as administrative charges before government agencies, employment and employment discrimination-related suits, employee benefit claims, breach of contract actions, tort claims and intellectual property-related litigation. In addition, because of the nature of our business, we are subject to a variety of legal actions relating to our business operations, including the design, administration and offering of our products and services. These could include claims relating to the denial or limitation of health benefits; federal and state false claims act laws; dispensing of drugs associated with our PBM business; professional liability claims arising out of the delivery of healthcare and related services to the public; development or application of medical policies and coverage and clinical guidelines; medical malpractice actions; product liability claims; allegations of anti-competitive and unfair business activities; provider disputes over reimbursement and contracts; provider tiering programs; narrow networks; termination of provider contracts; the recovery of overpayments from providers; fee-based business; disputes over co-payment calculations; reimbursement of out-of-network claims; the failure to disclose certain business practices; the failure to comply with various state or federal laws, including but not limited to, ERISA and the Mental Health Parity Act; and customer audits and contract performance, including government contracts. These actions or proceedings could result in substantial costs to us, require management to spend substantial time focused on litigation, result in negative media attention and may adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are also involved in, or may in the future be party to, pending or threatened litigation incidental to the business we transact or arising out of our operations, including, but not limited to, breaches of security and violations of privacy requirements, shareholder actions, compliance with federal and state laws and regulations (including qui tam or “whistleblower” actions), or sales and acquisitions of businesses or assets. From time to time, we are involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings, including challenges relating to the award of government contracts. These investigations, audits and reviews include routine and special investigations by various state insurance departments, federal regulators including CMS and the HHS Office of Inspector General, state attorneys general, the Department of Justice and various offices of the U.S. Attorney General. Following an investigation, we may be subject to civil or criminal fines, penalties and other sanctions if we are determined to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations. Liabilities that may result from these actions could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nRecent court decisions and legislative activity may increase our exposure for any of these types of claims. In some cases, substantial non-economic (including injunctive relief), treble or punitive damages may be sought. In addition, we operate in international jurisdictions where contractual rights, tax positions and applicable regulations may be subject to interpretation or uncertainty to a greater degree than in the U.S., and therefore subject to dispute by government authorities or others. Although we maintain insurance coverage for some of these potential liabilities, some liabilities and damages may not be covered by insurance, insurers may dispute coverage or the amount of insurance may not be enough to cover the damages awarded. In addition, insurance coverage for all or certain forms of liability may become unavailable or prohibitively expensive in the future. Any adverse judgment against us resulting in such damage awards could result in negative publicity and have an adverse effect on our cash flows, results of operations and financial condition.\nThere are various risks associated with providing healthcare services.\nThe direct provision of healthcare services by certain of our subsidiaries involves risks of additional litigation brought against us or our associates for alleged malpractice or professional liability claims arising out of treatment decisions or the delivery of healthcare and related services. In addition, liability may arise from maintaining healthcare premises that serve the public. The defense of any actions may result in significant expenses, and if we fail to maintain adequate insurance coverage for these liabilities, or if such insurance is not available, the resulting costs could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nAdditionally, many states in which certain of our subsidiaries operate limit the practice of medicine to licensed individuals or professional organizations comprised of licensed individuals. Business corporations generally may not exercise control over the medical decisions of physicians, and we are not licensed to practice medicine. Rules and regulations relating to the practice of medicine, fee-splitting between physicians and referral sources, and similar issues vary from state to state. Further, certain federal and state laws, including those covering our Medicare and Medicaid plans, prohibit the offer, payment, solicitation or receipt of any form of remuneration to induce, or in return for, the referral of patient care\n-31-\nopportunities and also generally prohibit physicians from making referrals to any entity providing certain designated health services if the referring physician or related person has an ownership or financial interest in the entity. Any enforcement actions by governmental officials alleging non-compliance with these rules and regulations could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur PBM services business and related operations are subject to risks and uncertainties that are in addition to those we face in our core healthcare business.\nWe provide PBM services through our IngenioRx business, and we are responsible to regulators and our customers for the delivery of those PBM services that we contract to provide. Our PBM services business is subject to the risks inherent in the dispensing, packaging, fulfillment and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products, including exposure to liabilities and reputational harm related to purported dispensing and other operational errors by us or our PBM services suppliers. Any failure by us or one of our PBM services suppliers to adhere to the laws and regulations applicable to the dispensing of pharmaceuticals could subject our PBM business to civil and criminal penalties.\nOur PBM services business is subject to federal and state laws and regulations that govern its relationships with pharmaceutical manufacturers, physicians, pharmacies and customers, including without limitation, federal and state anti-kickback laws, beneficiary inducement laws, consumer protection laws, ERISA, HIPAA and laws related to the operation of internet and mail-service pharmacies, as well as an increasing number of licensure, registration and other laws and accreditation standards that impact the business practices of a PBM services business. In addition, the practice of pharmacy is subject to federal and state laws and regulations, including those of state boards of pharmacy, individual state-controlled substance authorities, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Also, we and our third-party vendors are subject to registration requirements and state and federal laws concerning labeling, packaging, advertising, handling and adulteration of prescription drugs and dispensing of controlled substances. Noncompliance with applicable laws and regulations by us or our third-party vendors could have material adverse effects on our business, results of operations, financial condition, liquidity and reputation.\nFederal and state legislatures and regulators also regularly consider new laws and regulations and changes to existing policies for the industry that could materially affect current industry practices and our business, including the Rebate Rule released in November 2020 by HHS related to drug manufacturer rebates, spread pricing contract arrangements and the pricing of pharmaceuticals, and the Appropriations Act. Other potential new regulations include those regarding rebates, fees from pharmaceutical companies, the development and use of formularies and other utilization management tools, the use of average wholesale prices or other pricing benchmarks, pricing for specialty pharmaceuticals, limited access to networks, pharmacy network reimbursement methodologies and PBM reporting requirements, along with state regulations that may result from the June 2021 NAIC proposed white paper addressing PBMs.\nWe are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA that entitle us to the exclusive and, in certain areas, non-exclusive use of the BCBS names and marks in our geographic territories. The termination of these license agreements or changes in the terms and conditions of these license agreements could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur license agreements with the BCBSA contain certain requirements and restrictions regarding our operations and our use of the BCBS names and marks, and failure to comply with those requirements could result in a termination of the license agreements. The license agreements may be modified by the BCBSA, which could have a material adverse effect on our future expansion plans or results of operations. Further, BCBS licensees have certain requirements to perform administrative services for members of other BCBS licensees. As of December 31, 2021, we provided services to approximately 32 million Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees. If we or another BCBS licensee are not in compliance with all legal requirements or are unable to perform administrative services as required, this could have an adverse effect on our members and our ability to maintain our licenses, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nUpon the occurrence of an event causing termination of the license agreements, we would no longer have the right to use the BCBS names and marks or to sell BCBS health insurance products and services in one or more of our service areas. Furthermore, the BCBSA would be free to issue a license to use the BCBS names and marks in these service areas to another entity. Our existing BCBS members would be provided with instructions for obtaining alternative products and services\n-32-\nlicensed by the BCBSA. We believe that the BCBS names and marks are valuable identifiers of our products and services in the marketplace.\nUpon termination of either license agreement, the BCBSA would have the right to impose a “Re-establishment Fee” upon us, which would be used in part to fund the establishment of a replacement Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee in the vacated service area. The fee is set at $98.33 per licensed enrollee. If the Re-establishment Fee was applied to our total Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield enrollees of approximately 32 million as of December 31, 2021, we would be assessed approximately $3 billion by the BCBSA. As a result, termination of the license agreements would have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor more information on the BCBSA license agreements, including requirements, restrictions and termination events set forth in these license agreements, see Part I, Item 1, “Business — BCBSA Licenses” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndiana law, other applicable laws, our articles of incorporation and bylaws, and provisions of our BCBSA license agreements may prevent or discourage takeovers and business combinations that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interest.\nIndiana law, other applicable laws and regulations and provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws may delay, defer, prevent or render more difficult a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. For instance, they may prevent our shareholders from receiving the benefit from any premium to the market price of our common stock offered by a bidder in a takeover context or adversely affect the price that some investors are willing to pay for our stock.\nThe insurance holding company systems acts and certain health statutes of the states in which our insurance company or HMO subsidiaries are regulated restrict the ability of any person to obtain control of an insurance company or HMO without prior regulatory approval. Further, the Indiana Business Corporation Law contains business combination provisions that, in general, prohibit for five years any business combination with a beneficial owner of 10% or more of our common stock unless the holder’s acquisition of the stock was approved in advance by our Board of Directors.\nOur articles of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could have anti-takeover effects and may delay, defer or prevent a takeover attempt that our shareholders might consider to be in their best interests. Our articles of incorporation provide that no person may beneficially own shares of voting capital stock in excess of specified ownership limits, except with the prior approval of a majority of the “continuing directors.” The ownership limits, which may not be exceeded without the prior approval of the BCBSA, are the following: (1) for any institutional investor (as defined in our articles of incorporation), one share less than 10% of our outstanding voting securities; (2) for any non-institutional investor (as defined in our articles of incorporation), one share less than 5% of our outstanding voting securities; and (3) for any person, one share less than the number of shares of our common stock or other equity securities (or a combination thereof) representing a 20% ownership interest in us.\nIn addition, our articles of incorporation and bylaws: divide our Board of Directors into three classes serving staggered three-year terms (which is required by our license agreement with the BCBSA); permit our Board of Directors to determine the terms of and issue one or more series of preferred stock without further action by shareholders; restrict the maximum number of directors and the ability to increase that number; limit the ability of shareholders to remove directors; impose restrictions on shareholders’ ability to fill vacancies on our Board of Directors; impose advance notice requirements for shareholder proposals and nominations of directors to be considered at meetings of shareholders; prohibit shareholders from amending certain provisions of our bylaws; and impose restrictions on who may call a special meeting of shareholders.\nThe health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nThe health benefits industry is subject to negative publicity, which can arise from, among other things, increases in premium rates, industry consolidation, cost of care initiatives and debate around existing or proposed legislation. Negative publicity may result in increased regulation and legislative review of industry practices, which may further increase our costs of doing business and adversely affect our profitability by limiting our ability to market or provide our products and services, requiring us to change our products and services, or increasing the regulatory oversight under which we operate. In addition, any negative publicity concerning the BCBSA or other BCBSA licensees may adversely affect us and the sale of our health benefits products and services. Negative public perception or publicity of the health benefits industry in general, the BCBSA,\n-33-\nother BCBSA licensees, or us or our key vendors could adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nSTRATEGIC RISKS\nWe face competition in many of our markets, and if we fail to adequately adapt to changes in our industry and develop and implement strategic growth opportunities, our ability to compete and grow may be adversely affected.\nAs a health benefits company, we operate in a highly competitive environment and in an industry that is subject to significant changes from and competition due to legislative reform, business consolidations, new strategic alliances, new market entrants, aggressive marketing practices, technological advancements and changing market practices such as increasing usage of telehealth. We also will have to respond to pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and potentially disruptive new entrants in the public exchanges and in our other lines of business. These factors have produced and will likely continue to produce significant pressures on our profitability and membership. Furthermore, decisions to buy our products and services are increasingly made or influenced by consumers through means such as direct purchasing (for example, Medicare Advantage plans) and insurance exchanges that allow individual choice, or by large employers that may increasingly have the ability to contract directly with providers. This creates unique market pressures, and in order to compete effectively in the consumer-driven marketplace, we will be required to develop and deliver innovative and potentially disruptive products and services to satisfy evolving market demands.\nIn addition, the PBM industry is highly competitive, and IngenioRx is subject to competition from national, regional and local PBMs, other insurers, health plans, large retail pharmacy chains, large retail stores, supermarkets, mail order and web pharmacies, discount cards and specialty pharmacies. Strong competition within the PBM business has generated greater demand for lower product and service pricing, increased revenue sharing and enhanced product and service offerings. Our inability to maintain positive trends, contract on favorable terms with pharmaceutical manufacturers for, among other things, rebates, discounts and administrative fees or a failure to identify and implement new ways to mitigate pricing pressures, could negatively impact our ability to attract or retain customers, negatively impact our margins and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, legislative reforms such as the regulation recently issued by HHS related to rebates, and the Appropriations Act, which requires reporting of plan spending, the cost of plan pharmacy benefits, enrollee premiums and any manufacturer rebates received by the plan or issuer, may adversely affect our competitive position, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn order to profitably grow our business in the future, we need to not only grow our profitable medical membership, but also continue to diversify our sources of revenue and earnings, including through the increased sale of our specialty products, such as dental, vision and other supplemental products, expansion of products, expansion of our non-insurance assets and establishment of new cost of care solutions, including innovations in PBM services. If we are unable to acquire or develop and successfully manage new opportunities that further our strategic objectives and differentiate our products and services from our competitors, our ability to profitably grow our business could be adversely affected.\nWe are currently dependent on the non-exclusive services of independent agents and brokers in the marketing of our healthcare products, particularly with respect to individuals, seniors and certain group customers. We face intense competition for the services and allegiance of these independent agents and brokers, who may also market the products of our competitors. Our relationship with our brokers and independent agents could be adversely impacted by changes in our business practices to address legislative changes, including potential reductions in commissions and consulting fees paid to agents and brokers. We cannot ensure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors for these services or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially and adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nFor additional information, see “Business — Competition,” in Part I, Item 1 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-34-\nWe have built a significant portion of our current business through mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances and investments, and we expect to pursue such opportunities in the future.\nThe following are some of the risks associated with mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and strategic alliances and investments, referred to collectively as business combinations, that could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations:\n•\nsome business combinations may not achieve anticipated revenues, earnings or cash flow, business opportunities, synergies, growth prospects or other anticipated benefits;\n•\nwe may assume liabilities that were not disclosed to us or which were underestimated, and which could lead to legal challenges, investigations and enforcement actions;\n•\nwe may experience difficulties in integrating business combinations, including into our internal control environment and culture, be unable to integrate business combinations successfully or as quickly as expected and be unable to realize anticipated economic, operational and other benefits in a timely manner or at all;\n•\nbusiness combinations, and proposed business combinations that are not completed, could disrupt our ongoing business, lead to the incurrence of significant fees, distract management, result in the loss of key employees, divert resources, result in tax costs or inefficiencies and make it difficult to maintain our current business standards, controls, information technology systems, policies and procedures;\n•\nwe may finance future business combinations by issuing common stock for some or all of the purchase price, which could dilute the ownership interests of our shareholders;\n•\nwe may compete with other firms, some of which may have greater financial and other resources, to acquire attractive companies;\n•\nwe may experience disputes with our partners in our strategic alliances, investments and joint ventures, which could result in litigation or a loss of business; and\n•\nfuture business combinations may make it difficult to comply with the requirements of the BCBSA and lead to a risk that our BCBSA license agreements may be terminated.\nWe face intense competition to attract and retain employees. Further, managing key executive transition, succession and retention is critical to our success.\nOur success depends on our ability to attract and retain qualified employees and to integrate employees who have joined us through acquisitions. We face intense competition for qualified employees, and we may\nbe unable to attract and retain such employees or competition among potential employers may result in increasing salaries. An inability to retain existing employees or attract additional employees could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe would be adversely affected if we fail to adequately plan for the succession of our President and Chief Executive Officer and other key executives. While we have succession plans in place for members of our senior management, and employment arrangements with certain key executives, these plans and arrangements do not guarantee that the services of our senior executives will continue to be available to us or that we will be able to attract, transition and retain suitable successors.\nFINANCIAL RISKS\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on dividends from our subsidiaries, which are necessary to pay our outstanding indebtedness. Our regulated subsidiaries are subject to state regulations, including restrictions on the payment of dividends, maintenance of minimum levels of capital and restrictions on investment portfolios.\nAs a holding company, we are dependent on dividends and administrative expense reimbursements from our subsidiaries. Our regulated subsidiaries are not obligated to make funds available to us, and creditors of our subsidiaries will have a superior claim to certain of our subsidiaries’ assets. Furthermore, among other restrictions, state insurance and HMO laws may restrict the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In some states, we have made special undertakings that may limit the ability of our regulated subsidiaries to pay dividends. In most states, we are required to seek approval by state regulatory authorities before we transfer money or pay dividends from our regulated subsidiaries exceeding specified amounts. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make any payments to us will also depend on their earnings, the terms of their indebtedness, business and tax considerations and other legal restrictions. Our ability to repurchase shares, pay dividends to our shareholders and meet our obligations, including paying operating expenses and debt service on our\n-35-\noutstanding and future indebtedness, will depend upon the receipt of dividends from our subsidiaries. An inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends in an amount sufficient for us to meet our financial obligations may materially adversely affect our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nMost of our regulated subsidiaries are subject to RBC standards or other forms of minimum capital requirements that require them to report their results of risk-based capital calculations to the departments of insurance and the NAIC. Failure to maintain these minimum standards could subject our regulated subsidiaries to corrective action, including state supervision or liquidation. In addition, as discussed in more detail above, we are a party to license agreements with the BCBSA which contain additional minimum capital and liquidity requirements. Changes to existing RBC standards or minimum capital requirements could further restrict our or our regulated subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends and adversely affect our business.\nOur regulated subsidiaries are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of their investment portfolios and limit the amount of investments in certain riskier investment categories, such as below-investment-grade fixed maturity securities, mortgage loans, real estate and equity investments, which could generate higher returns on their investments. Failure to comply with these laws and regulations might cause investments exceeding regulatory limitations to be treated as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and risk-based capital, and, in some instances, require the sale of those investments.\nWe have substantial indebtedness outstanding and may incur additional indebtedness in the future, which could adversely affect our ability to pursue desirable business opportunities and to react to changes in the economy or our industry and exposes us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate indebtedness.\nOur debt service obligations require us to use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal on debt instead of for other corporate purposes, including funding future expansion. If our cash flow and capital resources are insufficient to service our debt obligations, we may be forced to seek extraordinary dividends from our subsidiaries, sell assets, seek additional equity or debt capital or restructure our debt. However, these measures might be unsuccessful or inadequate to meet scheduled debt service obligations or may not be available on commercially reasonable terms.\nWe may also incur future debt obligations that might subject us to restrictive covenants that could affect our financial and operational flexibility. Our breach or failure to comply with any of these covenants could result in a default under our credit facilities or other indebtedness. If we default under our credit agreement, the lenders could cease to make further extensions of credit or cause all of our outstanding debt obligations under our credit agreement to become immediately due and payable, together with accrued and unpaid interest. If the indebtedness under our notes or our credit agreement or our other indebtedness is accelerated, we may be unable to repay or finance the amounts due, on commercially reasonable terms, or at all.\nA downgrade in our credit ratings could have an adverse effect on our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations.\nClaims-paying ability, financial strength and debt ratings by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance and health benefits companies. We believe our strong credit ratings are an important factor in marketing our products to customers. In addition, if our credit ratings are downgraded or placed under review, our business, cash flows, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs. Each of the ratings organizations reviews our ratings periodically, and there can be no assurance that our current ratings will be maintained in the future.\nThe value of our intangible assets may become impaired.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $35 billion of goodwill and other intangible assets, representing 36% of our total consolidated assets. In accordance with applicable accounting standards, we periodically evaluate our goodwill and other intangible assets for potential impairment, using assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units. Estimated fair values might be significantly different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. If estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives in future impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.\n-36-\nThe value we place on intangible assets may be adversely impacted if existing or future business combinations fail to perform in a manner consistent with our assumptions. In addition, from time to time we divest businesses, and any such divestiture could result in significant asset impairment and disposition charges, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, the estimated value of our reporting units may be impacted as a result of business decisions we make associated with any future changes to laws and regulations, which could unfavorably affect the carrying value of certain goodwill and other intangible assets and result in impairment charges in future periods. Any future evaluations requiring an impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets could materially affect our results of operations and shareholders’ equity which could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.\nThe value of our investments is influenced by varying economic and market conditions, and a decrease in value may result in a loss charged to income.\nWe maintain a significant investment portfolio of cash equivalents and short-term and long-term investments in a variety of securities, which are subject to general credit, liquidity, market and interest rate risks. As a result, we may experience a reduction in value or loss of our investments, which may have a negative adverse effect on our results of operations, liquidity and financial condition. Changes in the economic environment, including periods of increased volatility in the securities markets such as those experienced in connection with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, can increase the difficulty of assessing investment impairment and increase the risk of potential impairment of these assets. Declines in the fair value of our investments may occur and material impairments may be charged to income in future periods, resulting in recognized losses.\nGENERAL RISKS\nChanges in tax laws and regulations, or challenges to our tax positions, could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we may not be able to realize the value of our deferred tax assets.\nWe have operations in the U.S and internationally. As a result, we are subject to the tax laws of several jurisdictions. From time to time, proposals are made in the U.S. and other jurisdictions that could adversely affect our tax positions, effective tax rate or tax payments. Changes in tax laws and regulations, including a potential increase in U.S. or international corporate tax rates or changes in the deductibility of expenses, or changes in the interpretation of tax laws and regulations by\ngovernmental authorities, could have a material impact on the future value of our deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities, could result in significant one-time charges in the current or future taxable years and could increase our future tax expense. In addition, we are regularly audited by federal U.S. and other tax authorities. Although we believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, the final determination of audits and any related litigation in the jurisdictions where we are subject to taxation could be materially different from our historical income provisions and accruals. These changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, cash flow, financial condition and results of operations.\nIn addition, any future increase in our valuation allowance with regard to our deferred tax assets would result in additional income tax expense and a decrease in shareholders’ equity, which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations in the period in which the increase occurs. A material decrease in shareholders’ equity could, in turn, negatively impact our debt ratings or potentially impact our compliance with existing debt covenants.\nWe also face other risks that could adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations, which include:\n•\nadverse securities and credit market conditions, which could impact our ability to meet liquidity needs;\n•\nany requirement to restate financial results in the event of inappropriate application of accounting principles;\n•\na significant failure of our internal control over financial reporting;\n•\nfailure of our prevention and control systems related to employee compliance with internal policies, including data security and data privacy;\n•\nprovider fraud that is not prevented or detected and impacts our medical costs or those of self-insured customers;\n•\nfailure to protect our proprietary information and other sensitive data; and\n•\nfailure of our corporate governance policies or procedures.\n-37-"

References to the terms “we,” “our,” “us,” “Anthem” or the “Company” used throughout this MD&A refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and, unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries. References to the “states” include the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, unless the context otherwise requires.\nThis section of this Annual Report on Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. A detailed discussion of 2019 items and year-over-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOverview\nWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving greater than 45 million medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2021. We are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding 30 counties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. In addition, we conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states across the country as AIM Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, Beacon, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. We offer pharmacy benefits management (“PBM”) services through our IngenioRx, Inc. (“IngenioRx”) subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries.\nWe manage our operations by customer types through four reportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other.\nOur results of operations discussed throughout this MD&A are determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). We also calculate operating gain and operating margin to further aid investors in understanding and analyzing our core operating results. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense. Operating margin is calculated as operating gain divided by operating revenue. Our definition of operating gain and operating margin may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. We use these measures as a basis for evaluating segment performance, allocating resources, forecasting future operating periods and setting incentive compensation targets. This information is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for income before income tax expense, net income or fully-diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) prepared in accordance with GAAP. For additional details on operating gain, see our “Reportable Segments Results of Operations” discussion included in this MD&A. For a reconciliation of reportable segment operating revenue to the amounts of total revenue included in the consolidated statements of income and a reconciliation of reportable segment operating gain to income before income tax expense, see Note 20, “Segment Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nOur operating revenue consists of premiums, product revenue, and administrative fees and other revenue. Premium revenue is generated from risk-based contracts where we indemnify our policyholders against costs for covered health and life insurance benefits. Product revenue represents services performed by IngenioRx for unaffiliated PBM customers and includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and\n-41-\nadministrative fees. Unaffiliated PBM customers include our fee-based groups that contract with IngenioRx for PBM services and external customers outside of the health plans we own. Administrative fees and other revenue come from fees from our fee-based customers for the processing of transactions or network discount savings realized, revenues from our Medicare processing business and revenues from other health-related businesses, including care management programs and miscellaneous other income.\nOur benefit expense primarily includes costs of care for health services consumed by our risk-based members, such as outpatient care, inpatient hospital care, professional services (primarily physician care) and pharmacy benefit costs. All four components are affected both by unit costs and utilization rates. Unit costs include the cost of outpatient medical procedures per visit, inpatient hospital care per admission, physician fees per office visit and prescription drug prices. Utilization rates represent the volume of consumption of health services and typically vary with the age and health status of our members and their social and lifestyle choices, along with clinical protocols and medical practice patterns in each of our markets. A portion of benefit expense recognized in each reporting period consists of actuarial estimates of claims incurred but not yet paid by us. Any changes in these estimates are recorded in the period the need for such an adjustment arises. While we offer a diversified mix of managed care products and services through our managed care plans, our aggregate cost of care can fluctuate based on a change in the overall mix of these products and services. Our managed care plans include: Preferred Provider Organizations; Health Maintenance Organizations; Point-of-Service plans; traditional indemnity plans and other hybrid plans, including Consumer-Driven Health Plans; and hospital only and limited benefit products.\nWe classify certain quality improvement costs as benefit expense. Quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. They also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members. These quality improvement costs may be comprised of expenses incurred for: (i) medical management, including care coordination and case management; (ii) health and wellness, including disease management services for such conditions as diabetes, high-risk pregnancies, congestive heart failure and asthma management and wellness initiatives like weight-loss programs and smoking cessation treatments; and (iii) clinical health policy, such as identification and use of best clinical practices to avoid harm, identifying clinical errors and safety concerns, and identifying potential adverse drug interactions.\nOur cost of products sold represents the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by IngenioRx for our unaffiliated PBM customers (net of rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment and certain direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.\nOur selling, general and administrative expenses consist of fixed and variable costs. Examples of fixed costs are depreciation, amortization and certain facilities expenses. Certain variable costs, such as premium taxes, vary directly with premium volume. Commission expense generally varies with premium or membership volume. Other variable costs, such as salaries and benefits, do not vary directly with changes in premium but are more aligned with changes in membership. The acquisition or loss of a significant block of business would likely impact staffing levels and thus, associated compensation expense. Other variable costs include professional and consulting expenses and advertising. Other factors can impact our administrative cost structure, including systems efficiencies, inflation and changes in productivity.\nOur results of operations depend in large part on our ability to accurately predict and effectively manage healthcare costs through effective contracting with providers of care to our members, product pricing, medical management and health and wellness programs, innovative product design and our ability to maintain or achieve improvement in our Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Star ratings. Several economic factors related to healthcare costs, such as regulatory mandates of coverage as well as direct-to-consumer advertising by providers and pharmaceutical companies, have a direct impact on the volume of care consumed by our members. The potential effect of escalating healthcare costs, any changes in our ability to negotiate competitive rates with our providers and any regulatory or market-driven restrictions on our ability to obtain adequate premium rates to offset overall inflation in healthcare costs, including increases in unit costs and utilization resulting from the aging of the population and other demographics, the impact of epidemics and pandemics, as well as advances in medical technology, may impose further risks to our ability to profitably underwrite our business and may have a material adverse impact on our results of operations.\nWe intend to expand through a combination of organic growth, strategic acquisitions and efficient use of capital in both existing and new markets. Our growth strategy is designed to enable us to take advantage of additional economies of scale, as\n-42-\nwell as provide us access to new and evolving technologies and products. In addition, we believe geographic and product diversity reduces our exposure to local or regional regulatory, economic and competitive pressures and provides us with increased opportunities for growth. In 2019, we began using our subsidiary IngenioRx to market and offer PBM services, and we expect IngenioRx to continue to improve our ability to integrate pharmacy benefits within our medical and specialty platform. In 2021, we continued growing our government-sponsored business through organic growth and the acquisition of MMM Holdings, LLC (“MMM”). In all other markets, we intend to maintain our position by delivering excellent service, offering competitively priced products, providing access to high-quality provider networks and effectively capitalizing on the brand strength of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield names and marks.\nFor additional information about our business and reportable segments, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” and Note 20, “Segment Information” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nCOVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to impact the global economy, cause market instability and uncertainty in the labor market and put pressure on the healthcare system, and it has impacted, and will likely continue to impact, our membership, our benefit expense and our member behavior, including how members access healthcare services. We continue to assist our customers, providers, members and communities in addressing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, including by providing expanded benefit coverage for COVID-19 diagnostic tests, treatment and vaccine administration and taking steps to increase vaccinations by enabling, educating and encouraging vaccine acceptance among our members as well as in the communities in which we operate.\nCOVID-19 care, testing and vaccine administration, and the impact of new COVID-19 variants, have resulted in increased medical costs for us in 2021. In 2021, our Medicaid membership continued to grow as a result of the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which we expect will remain suspended at least until the second quarter of 2022. Our Commercial fee-based membership decreased in 2021 due to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. See “Business Trends -\nMedical Cost Trends\n” below for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our healthcare costs.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic continues to evolve and the full extent of its impact will depend on future developments, which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted at this time. We will continue to monitor the COVID-19 pandemic as well as resulting legislative and regulatory changes to manage our response and assess and mitigate potential adverse impacts to our business. For additional discussion regarding our risks related to the COVID-19 pandemic and our other risk factors, see Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nBusiness Trends\nThe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively, the “ACA”), has impacted our business model and strategy, and various legal challenges since its enactment have introduced increased uncertainty to our business. In June 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its opinion and dismissed the latest legal challenge to the constitutionality of the ACA, leaving the law intact. We expect that most of the ACA will continue to remain in place and continue to impact our business operations and results of operations, including pricing, minimum medical loss ratios and the geographies in which our products are available.\nIn 2021, we made the decision to modestly expand our participation in on-exchange products through state- or federally-facilitated market places (the “Public Exchange”) for 2022 after also expanding in 2021. As a result, for 2022 we are offering Public Exchange products in 122 of the 143 rating regions in which we operate, in comparison to 103 of 143 rating regions in 2021. Our strategy has been, and will continue to be, to only participate in rating regions where we have an appropriate level of confidence that these markets are on a path toward sustainability, including, but not limited to, factors such as expected financial performance, regulatory environment, and underlying market characteristics. Changes to our business environment are likely to continue as elected officials at the national and state levels continue to enact, and both elected officials and candidates for election continue to propose, significant modifications to existing laws and regulations, including changes to taxes and fees. In addition, the continuing growth in our government-sponsored business exposes us to increased regulatory oversight.\n-43-\nOur IngenioRx subsidiary markets and offers PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers throughout the country, as well as to customers outside of the health plans we own. Our comprehensive PBM services portfolio includes features such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, a prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities. IngenioRx delegates certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, pursuant to a five-year agreement. With IngenioRx, we retain the responsibilities for clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy.\nPricing Trends:\nWe strive to price our health benefit products consistent with anticipated underlying medical cost trends. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic (including new COVID-19 variants, which may be more contagious or severe, or less responsive to treatment or vaccines) and the impacts it may have on our pricing, such as surges in COVID-19 related hospitalizations, infection rates, the cost of COVID-19 vaccines, testing and treatment and the return of non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization to our estimate of normal levels, based on historical utilization patterns. We frequently make adjustments to respond to legislative and regulatory changes as well as pricing and other actions taken by existing competitors and new market entrants. Product pricing in our Commercial & Specialty Business segment, including our Individual and small group lines of business, remains competitive. Revenues from the Medicare and Medicaid programs are dependent, in whole or in part, upon annual funding from the federal government and/or applicable state governments. The ACA imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee (“HIP Fee”) on health insurers that write certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks. We priced our affected products to cover the impact of the HIP Fee when it was in effect. The HIP Fee was in effect for 2020 but was permanently repealed beginning in 2021.\nMedical Cost Trends:\nOur medical cost trends are primarily driven by increases in the utilization of services across all provider types and the unit cost increases of these services. We work to mitigate these trends through various medical management programs such as care and condition management, program integrity and specialty pharmacy management and utilization management, as well as benefit design changes. There are many drivers of medical cost trends that can cause variance from our estimates, such as changes in the level and mix of services utilized, regulatory changes, aging of the population, health status and other demographic characteristics of our members, epidemics, pandemics, advances in medical technology, new high cost prescription drugs, and healthcare provider or member fraud.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic initially caused a decrease in utilization of non-COVID-19 health services, which decreased our claim costs in 2020. Over the course of the first half of 2021, our non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization experience gradually increased toward normalized levels, while COVID-19 related healthcare expenses declined and COVID-19 vaccination administration costs increased. During the second half of 2021, the COVID-19 Delta variant caused a significant increase in COVID-19 related healthcare utilization as a result of increased testing, treatment, and hospitalization costs, which was partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization. The reduction in non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization was particularly notable in the inpatient setting, as some regions limited elective surgeries to preserve limited resources to treat patients hospitalized with COVID-19. Costs related to child vaccinations and adult boosters were also incurred during the fourth quarter of 2021.\nThe COVID-19 Omicron variant increased confirmed COVID-19 cases to significant levels at the end of 2021 and the beginning of 2022. This is expected to further increase COVID-19 costs related to testing, treatment and hospitalization costs, but is expected to be partially offset by a reduction in non-COVID-19 healthcare utilization. In 2022, we anticipate additional claim costs for new pharmaceutical treatments for COVID-19 and compliance with governmental regulations on COVID-19 testing reimbursement. We expect claims costs related to COVID-19 testing, treatment and hospitalizations to continue throughout 2022 even after the latest wave of COVID-19 infections in the U.S. subsides. The continued cost and volume of covered services related to the COVID-19 pandemic may have a material adverse effect on our future claim costs. We continue to closely monitor the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on our business, financial condition, results of operations and medical cost trends.\nFor additional discussion regarding business trends, see Part I, Item 1, “Business” of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRegulatory Trends and Uncertainties\nFederal and state governments have enacted, and may continue to enact, legislation and regulations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that have had, and we expect will continue to have, a significant impact on health benefits, consumer\n-44-\neligibility for public programs and our cash flows for all of our lines of business. These actions, which are or have been in effect for various durations, provide, among other things:\n•\nmandates to waive cost-sharing for COVID-19 testing, treatment (including over-the-counter testing in accordance with state and federal requirements such as California SB 510 and the January 2022 federal requirements), vaccines and related services;\n•\nreforms, including waiving Medicare originating site restrictions for qualified providers of telehealth services;\n•\nfinancial support to healthcare providers, including expansion of the Medicare accelerated payment program to all providers receiving Medicare payments;\n•\nmandated expansion of premium payment terms, including the time period for which claims can be denied for lack of payment; and\n•\nmandates related to prior authorizations and payment levels to providers, additional consumer enrollment windows and an increased ability to provide telehealth services.\nThe Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2021, which was enacted in December 2020 (the “Appropriations Act”), contains a number of provisions that may have a material effect upon our business, including procedures and coverage requirements related to surprise medical bills and new mandates for continuity of care for certain patients, price comparison tools, disclosure of broker compensation and reporting on pharmacy benefits and drug costs. The health plan-related requirements of the Appropriations Act have varying effective dates beginning as early as December 2021, some of which have been extended since the enactment of the Appropriations Act.\nThe American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, (the “Rescue Plan”), which was enacted in March 2021, contains several health-related provisions that have impacted our business, including expansion of premium tax credits for our Public Exchange business and full subsidization of the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (“COBRA”) continuation coverage for those who were involuntarily terminated or had their work hours reduced. The Rescue Plan’s premium tax provisions became effective in January 2021, while the COBRA premium subsidization extended from April through September 2021.\nThe ACA has evolved and various legal challenges since its enactment introduced increased uncertainty to our business. We expect that most of the ACA will remain in place and continue to significantly impact our business operations and results of operations; however, federal regulatory agencies continue to modify regulations and guidance related to the ACA and our businesses more broadly. We also expect further and ongoing regulatory guidance on a number of issues related to Medicare, including evolving methodology for ratings and quality bonus payments. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) is also proposing changes to its program that audits data submitted under the risk adjustment programs in a way that would increase financial recoveries from plans. We will continue to evaluate the impact of the ACA as any further developments or judicial rulings occur.\nBeginning in July 2022, the Health Plan Transparency Rule will require us to disclose, on a monthly basis, detailed pricing information regarding negotiated rates for all covered items and services between the plan or issuer and in-network providers and historical payments to, and billed charges from, out-of-network providers. Additionally, beginning in 2023, we will be required to make available to members personalized out-of-pocket cost information and the underlying negotiated rates for 500 covered healthcare items and services, including prescription drugs. In 2024, this requirement will expand to all items and services.\nThe non-deductible HIP Fee was permanently eliminated beginning in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $1,570 as selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding expense for 2021 due to the elimination of the HIP Fee beginning in 2021.\nFor additional discussion regarding regulatory trends and uncertainties, and risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements made in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, see Part I, Item 1, “Business —\nRegulation\n” and Part I, Item 1A, “Risk Factors.”\n-45-\nOther Significant Items\nBusiness and Operational Matters\nOn November 10, 2021, we announced our entrance into an agreement with Personal Touch Holding Corporation to acquire Integra Managed Care (“Integra”). Integra is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own homes. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2022 and is subject to standard closing conditions and customary approvals.\nOn June 29, 2021, we completed our acquisition of MMM and its Medicare Advantage plan, Medicaid plan and other affiliated companies from InnovaCare Health, L.P. MMM is a Puerto Rico-based integrated healthcare organization and seeks to provide its Medicare Advantage and Medicaid members with a whole health experience through its network of specialized clinics and wholly owned independent physician associations. This acquisition aligns with our vision to be an innovative, valuable and inclusive healthcare partner by providing care management programs that improve the lives of the people we serve.\nOn April 28, 2021, we completed our acquisition of myNEXUS, Inc. (“myNEXUS”) from WindRose Health Investors. myNEXUS is a comprehensive home-based nursing management company for payors and, at the time of acquisition, delivered integrated clinical support services for Medicare Advantage members across twenty states. This acquisition aligns with our strategy to manage integrated, whole person multi-site care and support by providing national, large-scale expertise to manage nursing services in the home and facilitate transitions of care.\nOn February 28, 2020, we completed our acquisition of Beacon Health Options, Inc. (“Beacon”), which was the largest independently held behavioral health organization in the country. At the time of acquisition, Beacon served more than thirty-four million individuals across all fifty states. This acquisition aligned with our strategy to diversify into health services and deliver both integrated solutions and care delivery models that personalize care for people with complex and chronic conditions.\nFor additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K.\nIn 2020, we introduced enterprise-wide initiatives to optimize our business and as a result, recorded a charge of $653 in selling, general and administrative expenses. We believe these initiatives largely represent the next step forward in our progression towards becoming a more agile organization, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we identified additional office space reductions and related fixed asset impairments due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic and recorded a charge of $202 in selling general and administrative expenses. For additional information, see Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives” and Note 18, “Leases,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLitigation Matters\nIn the consolidated multi-district proceeding in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”) captioned\nIn re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\n(“BCBSA Litigation”), the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association (the “BCBSA”), and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees, including us (the “Blue plans”) have approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”) with the plaintiffs representing a putative nationwide class of health plan subscribers. Generally, the lawsuits in the BCBSA Litigation challenge elements of the licensing agreements between the BCBSA and the independently owned and operated Blue plans. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers, and the Subscriber Settlement Agreement applies only to the putative subscriber class. No settlement agreement has been reached with the provider plaintiffs at this time, and the defendants continue to contest the consolidated cases brought by the provider plaintiffs.\nIf approved by the Court, the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will require the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment, our portion of which is estimated to be $594, and will include certain terms imposing non-monetary obligations on the defendants. As of December 31, 2021, the liability balance accrued for our estimated remaining payment obligation was $507, net of payments made. All terms of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement are subject to approval by the\n-46-\nCourt before they become effective. For additional information regarding the BCBSA Litigation, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies –\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings – Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\n,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIn January 2019, we exercised our contractual right to terminate our PBM agreement (the “ESI PBM Agreement”) with Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”). We completed the transition of our members from Express Scripts to IngenioRx by January 1, 2020. Notwithstanding our termination of the ESI PBM Agreement, the litigation between us and Express Scripts regarding the ESI PBM Agreement continues. For additional information regarding this lawsuit, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies -\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings - Express Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation,\n” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSelected Operating Performance\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, total medical membership increased by 2 million, or 5.7%. The increase in medical membership was driven primarily by growth in our Government Business’ Medicaid membership, including organic growth resulting from the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic, growth resulting from our acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021 and the launch of our HealthyBlue managed care alliance in North Carolina. Our Medicare Advantage membership also increased due to organic growth and the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021. Increases in Group risk-based membership resulting from sales exceeding lapses, increases in Individual membership due to our Public Exchange expansion in 2021 and BlueCard® increases also contributed to overall membership increases. Declines in our Group fee-based membership relating to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset the increases in our medical membership.\nOperating revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $136,943, an increase of $16,135, or 13.4%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in operating revenue was primarily driven by higher premium revenue due mainly to membership growth in our Government Business segment, including the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021, and increased product revenue in our IngenioRx segment. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021.\nNet income for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $6,095, an increase of $1,523, or 33.3%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net income was primarily due to increased operating gain in all of our business units, as well as increased investment income. The increased operating gain in our business units was due to the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA litigation accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020 and reduced business optimization charges in 2021. The increase in our investment income resulted from an increase in income derived from our alternative investments in comparison to 2020, partially offset by reduced dividends received on our equity investments.\nOur fully-diluted shareholders' earnings per share (“EPS”) for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $24.73, an increase of $6.75, or 37.5%, from the year ended December 31, 2020. Our diluted shares for the year ended December 31, 2021 were 246.8, a decrease of 7.5, or 2.9%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in EPS resulted from the increase in net income, as well as lower shares outstanding in 2021.\nOperating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $8,364, or approximately 1.4 times net income. Operating cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $10,688, or approximately 2.3 times net income. The decrease in operating cash flow was primarily due to the impact of working capital changes year-over-year, including an increase in receivables and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher net income in 2021.\n-47-\nMembership\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we updated our medical membership reporting to better align with how we view our business. Our medical membership now includes the following customer types: Individual, Group risk-based, Group fee-based, BlueCard\n®\n, Medicare, Medicaid and our Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. BCBS-branded business generally refers to members in our service areas licensed by the BCBSA. Non-BCBS-branded business refers to members in our non-BCBS-branded Amerigroup, Freedom Health, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare and Simply Healthcare plans, as well as HealthLink and UniCare members. In addition to the above medical membership, we also serve customers who purchase one or more of our other products or services that are often ancillary to our health business.\n•\nIndividual consists of individual customers under age 65 and their covered dependents. Individual policies are generally sold through independent agents and brokers, retail partnerships, our in-house sales force or via the Public Exchanges. Individual business is sold on a risk-based basis. We offer on-exchange products through Public Exchanges and off-exchange products. Federal premium subsidies are available only for certain Public Exchange Individual products. Unsubsidized Individual customers are generally more sensitive to product pricing and, to a lesser extent, the configuration of the network and the efficiency of administration. Customer turnover is generally higher with Individual as compared to Group risk-based. Individual business accounted for 1.7%, 1.6% and 1.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nGroup risk-based consists of employer customers who purchase products on a full-risk basis, which are products for which we charge a premium and indemnify our policyholders against costs for health benefits. Group risk-based accounts include Local Group customers and National Accounts. Local Group consists of those employer customers with less than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state, as well as customers with more than 5% of eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state with up to 5,000 eligible employees. In addition, Local Group includes Student Health members. National Accounts generally consist of multi-state employer groups primarily headquartered in an Anthem service area with at least 5% of the eligible employees located outside of the headquarter state and with more than 5,000 eligible employees. Some exceptions are allowed based on broker and consultant relationships. Group risk-based accounts are generally sold through brokers or consultants who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force and are offered both on and off the Public Exchanges. Group risk-based accounted for 8.8%, 8.9% and 9.6% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nGroup fee-based customers represent employer groups, Local Group, including UniCare members, and National Accounts, who purchase fee-based products and elect to retain most or all of the financial risk associated with their employees’ healthcare costs. Some fee-based customers choose to purchase stop loss coverage to limit their retained risk. Group fee-based accounts are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer working with our in-house sales force. Group fee-based accounted for 42.7%, 45.5% and 47.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nBlueCard\n®\nhost customers represent enrollees of Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield plans not owned by Anthem who receive healthcare services in our BCBSA licensed markets. BlueCard\n®\nmembership consists of estimated host members using the national BlueCard\n®\nprogram. Host members are generally members who reside in or travel to a state in which an Anthem subsidiary is the Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensee and who are covered under an employer-sponsored health plan issued by a non-Anthem controlled BCBSA licensee (the “home plan”). We perform certain functions, including claims pricing and administration, for BlueCard\n®\nmembers, for which we receive administrative fees from the BlueCard\n®\nmembers’ home plans. Other administrative functions, including maintenance of enrollment information and customer service, are performed by the home plan. Host members are computed using, among other things, the average number of BlueCard\n®\nclaims received per month. BlueCard\n®\nhost membership accounted for 13.6%, 14.1% and 14.8% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nMedicare customers are Medicare-eligible individual members age 65 and over who have enrolled in Medicare Advantage, including Special Needs Plans (“SNPs”), also known as Medicare Advantage SNPs; dual-eligible programs through Medicare-Medicaid Plans (“MMPs”); Medicare Supplement plans; and Medicare Part D Prescription Drug Plans (“Medicare Part D”). Medicare Advantage plans provide Medicare beneficiaries with a managed care alternative to traditional Medicare and often include a Medicare Part D benefit. In addition, our\n-48-\nMedicare Advantage SNPs provide tailored benefits to special needs individuals who are institutionalized or have severe or disabling chronic conditions and to dual-eligible customers, who are low-income seniors and persons under age 65 with disabilities. Medicare Advantage SNPs are coordinated care plans specifically designed to provide targeted care, covering all the healthcare services considered medically necessary for members and often providing professional care coordination services, with personal guidance and programs that help members maintain their health. Medicare Advantage membership also includes Medicare Advantage members in our Group Retiree Solutions business who are retired members of Commercial accounts or retired members of groups who are not affiliated with our Commercial accounts who have selected a Medicare Advantage product through us. Medicare Supplement plans typically pay the difference between healthcare costs incurred by a beneficiary and amounts paid by Medicare. Medicare Part D offers a prescription drug plan to Medicare and MMP beneficiaries. MMP, which was established as a result of the passage of the ACA, is a demonstration program focused on serving members who are dually eligible for Medicaid and Medicare. Medicare Supplement and Medicare Advantage products are marketed in the same manner, primarily through independent agents and brokers. Medicare program business accounted for 6.2%, 5.5% and 5.2% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nMedicaid membership represents eligible members who receive health benefits through publicly funded healthcare programs, including Medicaid, ACA-related Medicaid expansion programs, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, programs for seniors and people with disabilities, Children’s Health Insurance Programs, and specialty programs such as those focused on long-term services and support, HIV/AIDS, foster care, behavioral health and/or substance abuse disorders, and intellectual disabilities or developmental disabilities, among others. Total Medicaid program business accounted for 23.4%, 20.6% and 17.7% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n•\nFEHB members consist of United States government employees and their dependents within our geographic markets through our participation in the national contract between the BCBSA and the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. FEHB business accounted for 3.6%, 3.8% and 3.9% of our medical members at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n-49-\nThe following table presents our medical membership by reportable segment and customer type as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Also included below is other membership by product. The medical membership and other membership presented are unaudited and in certain instances include estimates of the number of members represented by each contract at the end of the period.\nDecember 31, 2021 Compared to December 31, 2020\nMedical Membership\nTotal medical membership increased primarily due to growth in our Government Business’ Medicaid membership, including organic growth resulting from the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification during the COVID-19 pandemic, growth resulting from our acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021 and the launch of our HealthyBlue managed care alliance in North Carolina. Our Medicare Advantage membership also increased due to organic growth and our acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021. Increases in Group risk-based membership resulting from sales exceeding lapses, increases in Individual membership due to our Public Exchange expansion in 2021 and BlueCard\n®\nincreases also contributed to overall membership increases. Declines in our Group fee-based membership relating to in-group attrition likely attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic partially offset the increases in our medical membership.\nOther Membership\nOur other membership can be impacted by changes in our medical membership, as our medical members often purchase our other products that are ancillary to our health business. Life and disability membership decreased primarily due to the loss of a Group risk-based account and membership decreases in our Group fee-based business. Dental membership increased\n-50-\nprimarily due to higher sales in our Individual and Group risk-based accounts and penetration increases in our FEHB program. Dental administration membership increased due to growth in our FEHB program. Vision membership increased primarily as a result of growth in our Medicare Advantage business.\nConsolidated Results of Operations\nOur consolidated summarized results of operations and other information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nCertain of the following definitions are also applicable to all other results of operations tables in this discussion:\nNM\nNot meaningful.\n1\nIncludes interest expense, amortization of other intangible assets and loss on extinguishment of debt.\n2\nBenefit expense ratio represents benefit expense as a percentage of premium revenue. Premiums for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $117,373, $104,109 and $94,173, respectively. Premiums are included in total operating revenue presented above.\n3\nbp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.\n4\nSelling, general and administrative expense ratio represents selling, general and administrative expense as a percentage of total operating revenue.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nTotal operating revenue increased primarily as a result of higher premium revenue due mainly to membership growth in our Government Business segment, including related to the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021, and increased product revenue in our IngenioRx segment. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021.\n-51-\nNet investment income increased primarily due to increases in net income from our alternative investments, partially offset by decreased dividends received on our equity investments.\nNet gains on financial instruments increased primarily due to increased realized gains on our alternative investments and increased net realized gains on our fixed maturity securities, partially offset by declines in the fair value of equity securities still held.\nBenefit expense increased primarily due to cost increases resulting from membership growth in our Medicaid and Medicare businesses, including related to our acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021, and increased COVID-19 healthcare costs for both our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments.\nOur benefit expense ratio increased primarily due to the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021 and increased COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 healthcare costs for both our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments.\nCost of products sold reflects the cost of pharmaceuticals dispensed by IngenioRx for our unaffiliated PBM customers. Cost of products sold increased as the corresponding pharmacy product revenues increased due to growth in customers served by IngenioRx in 2021.\nSelling, general and administrative expense decreased primarily due to the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021, the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA litigation accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020 and reduced business optimization charges in 2021. These items were partially offset by increased costs to support growth.\nOur selling, general and administrative expense ratio decreased primarily due to increased operating revenue in 2021, the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA litigation accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020, reduced business optimization charges in 2021 and the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021. These items were partially offset by increased costs to support growth.\nOur effective income tax rate decreased primarily due to the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021, which was non-deductible for tax purposes.\nOur net income as a percentage of total revenue increased in 2021 as compared to 2020 as a result of all the factors discussed above.\n-52-\nReportable Segments Results of Operations\nThe following table presents a summary of our reportable segment financial information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nNM    Not meaningful.\n1\nIncludes expenses of $106 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2021; $311 for business optimization initiatives and $524 for the BCBSA Litigation recognized in 2020.\n2    Includes expenses of $47 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2021; $205 for business optimization initiatives and $24 for the BCBSA Litigation recognized in 2020.\n3    Includes expenses of $2 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2021; $4 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020.\n4    Includes expenses of $32 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2021; $133 for business optimization initiatives recognized in 2020.\n5\nbp = basis point; one hundred basis points = 1%.\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020\nCommercial & Specialty Business\nOperating revenue increased primarily due to premium rate increases in our Commercial risk-based businesses designed to cover medical cost trends, increased membership in our Commercial risk-based businesses, administrative fee increases in our Group fee-based businesses and the absence in 2021 of premium credits provided to members enrolled in select Group and Individual health plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021.\nThe increase in operating gain was primarily due to the absence of charges in 2021 for the BCBSA Litigation accrual recognized in the third quarter of 2020, reduced business optimization charges in 2021 and the non-recurring premium credits provided to members enrolled in select Group and Individual health plans in response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the second quarter of 2020. These increases were partially offset by increased COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 healthcare costs in 2021.\n-53-\nGovernment Business\nOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher premium revenue growth in our Medicaid business, driven by the temporary suspension of eligibility recertification, which we expect will remain suspended at least until the second quarter of 2022, and the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021. Medicare membership growth in our Medicare business and the impact of the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021 also contributed to operating revenue growth. These increases were partially offset by the impact of lower premium revenue associated with the repeal of the HIP Fee for 2021, increased experience-rated refunds in our Medicaid business and lower risk-based revenue in our Medicare business.\nThe increase in operating gain was primarily driven by membership increases in both our Medicaid and Medicare businesses, including due to the acquisition of MMM on June 29, 2021, and reduced business optimization charges in 2021. These increases were partially offset by an increase in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 healthcare costs, increased experience-rated refunds in our Medicaid business and lower risk-based revenue in our Medicare business.\nIngenioRx\nOperating revenue and operating gain increased as a result of higher drug spend from IngenioRx customers, including spend related to increased Medicaid membership within our Government Business segment.\nThe increase in operating gain was primarily driven by growth in integrated medical and pharmacy members in 2021.\nOther\nOperating revenue increased primarily due to higher administrative fees and other revenue for services performed by our Diversified Business Group for our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business segments, primarily due to the implementation of affiliated behavioral health capitation contracts. In addition, unaffiliated revenues from Beacon, AIM and myNEXUS contributed to the overall increase.\nThe decrease in operating loss was driven by reduced business optimization charges in 2021 and a decline in unallocated corporate expenses in 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP. Application of GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes and within this MD&A. We consider our most important accounting policies that require significant estimates and management judgment to be those policies with respect to liabilities for medical claims payable, income taxes, goodwill and other intangible assets, investments and retirement benefits, which are discussed below. Our other significant accounting policies are summarized in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements. In general, our estimates are based on historical experience, evaluation of current trends, information from third-party professionals and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances. Estimates can require a significant amount of judgment, and a different set of assumptions could result in material changes to our reported results.\nMedical Claims Payable\nThe most subjective accounting estimate in our consolidated financial statements is our liability for medical claims payable. At December 31, 2021, this liability was $13,518 and represented 22% of our total consolidated liabilities. We record this liability and the corresponding benefit expense for incurred but not paid claims, including the estimated costs of processing such claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems, which approximated 96%, or $12,998, of our total medical claims liability as of December 31, 2021; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid, which approximated 4%, or $520, of the total medical claims payable as of December 31, 2021. The level of claims\n-54-\npayable processed through our systems but not yet paid may fluctuate from one period-end to the next, from approximately 1% to 5% of our total medical claims liability, due to timing of when claim payments are made.\nLiabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by Actuarial Standards of Practice. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims.\nFor the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”).\nBecause the reserve methodology is based upon historical information, it must be adjusted for known or suspected operational and environmental changes. These adjustments are made by our actuaries based on their knowledge and their estimate of emerging impacts to benefit costs and payment speed. Circumstances to be considered in developing our best estimate of reserves include changes in utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. A comparison of prior period liabilities to re-estimated claim liabilities based on subsequent claims development is also considered in making the liability determination. In our comparison to prior periods, the methods and assumptions are not changed as reserves are recalculated; rather, the availability of additional paid claims information drives changes in the re-estimate of the unpaid claim liability. To the extent appropriate, changes in such development are recorded as a change to current period benefit expense. The impact from COVID-19 on healthcare utilization and medical claims submission patterns has increased estimation uncertainty on our incurred but not reported liability at December 31, 2021. Slowdowns in claims submission patterns and increases in utilization levels for COVID-19 testing and treatment during 2021 are the primary factors that lead to the increased estimation uncertainty.\nWe regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods. Adjustments of prior year estimates may result in additional benefit expense or a reduction of benefit expense in the period an adjustment is made. Further, due to the considerable variability of healthcare costs, adjustments to claim liabilities occur each period and are sometimes significant as compared to the net income recorded in that period. Prior period development is recognized immediately upon the actuary’s judgment that a portion of the prior period liability is no longer needed or that an additional liability should have been accrued. That determination is made when sufficient information is available to ascertain that the re-estimate of the liability is reasonable.\nWhile there are many factors that are used as a part of the estimation of our medical claims payable liability, the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid claims liability as of December 31, 2021 were the completion and trend factors. As discussed above, these two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations.\n-55-\nThere is variation in the reasonable choice of completion factors by duration for durations of three months through twelve months where the completion factors have the most significant impact. As previously discussed, completion factors tend to be less reliable for the most recent months and therefore are not specifically utilized for months one and two. In our analysis for the claim liabilities at December 31, 2021, the variability in months three to five was estimated to be between 40 and 90 basis points, while months six through twelve have much lower estimated variability ranging from 0 to 30 basis points.\nThe difference in completion factor assumptions results in variability of 2%, or approximately $242, in the December 31, 2021 incurred but not paid claims liability, depending on the completion factors chosen. It is important to note that the completion factor methodology inherently assumes that historical completion rates will be reflective of the current period. However, it is possible that the actual completion rates for the current period will develop differently from historical patterns and therefore could fall outside the possible variations described herein.\nThe other major assumption used in the establishment of the December 31, 2021 incurred but not paid claim liability was the trend factors. In our analysis for the period ended December 31, 2021, there was a 320 basis point differential in the high and low trend factors. This range of trend factors would imply variability of 4%, or approximately $487, in the incurred but not paid claims liability, depending upon the trend factors used. Because historical trend factors are often not representative of current claim trends, the trend experience for the most recent six to nine months, plus knowledge of recent events likely affecting current trends, have been taken into consideration in establishing the incurred but not paid claims liability at December 31, 2021. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to have a significant impact on 2021 dates of service. Our expenses associated with COVID-19 accelerated in the fourth quarter of 2021, partially offset by the benefit from a lower volume of healthcare claims attributable to decreased utilization of non-COVID-19 health services. We will continue to monitor emerging experience in order to better understand the possible implications to our reserves.\nSee Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balance for medical claims payable for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Components of the total incurred claims for each year include amounts accrued for current year estimated claims expense as well as adjustments to prior year estimated accruals. In Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” the line labeled “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” accounts for those adjustments made to prior year estimates. The impact of any reduction of “Net incurred medical claims: Prior years redundancies” may be offset as we establish the estimate of “Net incurred medical claims: Current year.” Our reserving practice is to consistently recognize the actuarial best estimate of our ultimate liability for our claims. When we recognize a release of the redundancy, we disclose the amount that is not in the ordinary course of business, if material.\nThe ratio of current year medical claims paid as a percent of current year net medical claims incurred was 87.8% for 2021, 87.7% for 2020 and 89.3% for 2019. This ratio serves as an indicator of claims processing speed whereby 2021 claims were processed at a similar speed to 2020, but slower than in 2019.\nWe calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred claims payable less prior year redundancies in the current year in order to demonstrate the development of the prior year reserves. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this metric was 18.1%, reflecting the estimation uncertainty due to COVID-19 at the end of 2020, and was largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2020 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2020. For the year ended December 31, 2020, this metric was 8.0%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2019 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2019, this metric was 7.4%, largely driven by favorable trend factor development at the end of 2018 as well as favorable completion factor development from 2018.\nWe calculate the percentage of prior year redundancies in the current year as a percent of prior year net incurred medical claims to indicate the percentage of redundancy included in the preceding year calculation of current year net incurred medical claims. We believe this calculation supports the reasonableness of our prior year estimate of incurred medical claims and the consistency in our methodology. For the year ended December 31, 2021, this metric was 2%, which was calculated using the redundancy of $1,703. This metric was 0.8% for 2020 and 0.7% for 2019. We believe these metrics support the reasonableness of our estimates. The 2021 metric was impacted by the estimation uncertainty due to COVID-19.\n-56-\nThe following table shows the variance between total net incurred medical claims as reported in Note 12, “Medical Claims Payable,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K, for each of 2020 and 2019 and the incurred claims for such years had it been determined retrospectively (computed as the difference between “net incurred medical claims – current year” for the year shown and “net incurred medical claims – prior years redundancies” for the immediately following year):\nGiven that our business is primarily short tailed (which means that medical claims are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider), the variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported above, is used to assess the reasonableness of our estimate of ultimate incurred medical claims for a given calendar year with the benefit of one year of experience. We expect that substantially all of the development of the 2021 estimate of medical claims payable will be known during 2022.\nThe 2020 variance to total net incurred medical claims, as reported of 1.3% was greater than the 2019 percentage of 0.2%. This was driven by the fact that the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2020 as compared to 2019 was greater than the change in the prior year redundancy reported for 2019 as compared to 2018.\nIncome Taxes\nWe account for income taxes in accordance with the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance, which requires, among other things, the separate recognition of deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities. Such deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities represent the tax effect of temporary differences between financial reporting and tax reporting measured at tax rates enacted at the time the deferred tax asset or liability is recorded. A valuation allowance must be established for deferred tax assets if it is “more likely than not” that all or a portion may be unrealized. Our judgment is required in determining an appropriate valuation allowance.\nAt each financial reporting date, we assess the adequacy of the valuation allowance by evaluating each of our deferred tax assets based on the following:\n•\nthe types of temporary differences that created the deferred tax asset;\n•\nthe amount of taxes paid in prior periods and available for a carry-back claim;\n•\nthe tax rate at which the deferred tax assets will likely be utilized in the future;\n•\nthe forecasted future taxable income, and therefore, likely future deduction of the deferred tax item; and\n•\nany significant other issues impacting the likely realization of the benefit of the temporary differences.\nWe, like other companies, frequently face challenges from tax authorities regarding the amount of taxes due. These challenges include questions regarding the timing and amount of deductions that we have taken on our tax returns. In evaluating any additional tax liability associated with various positions taken in our tax return filings, we record additional liabilities for potential adverse tax outcomes. Based on our evaluation of our tax positions, we believe we have appropriately accrued for uncertain tax benefits, as required by the applicable guidance. To the extent we prevail in matters we have accrued for, our future effective tax rate would be reduced and net income would increase. If we are required to pay more than accrued, our future effective tax rate would increase and net income would decrease. Our effective tax rate and net income in any given future period could be materially impacted.\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are regularly audited by federal and other tax authorities, and from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. We believe our tax positions comply with applicable tax law, and we intend to defend our positions vigorously through the federal, state and local appeals processes. We believe we have adequately\n-57-\nprovided for any reasonably foreseeable outcome related to these matters. Accordingly, although their ultimate resolution may require additional tax payments, we do not anticipate any material impact on our results of operations or financial condition from these matters.\nFor additional information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nOur consolidated goodwill at December 31, 2021 was $24,228 and other intangible assets were $10,615. The sum of goodwill and other intangible assets represented 35.8% of our total consolidated assets and 96.6% of our consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021.\nWe follow FASB guidance for business combinations and goodwill and other intangible assets, which specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Under the guidance, goodwill and other intangible assets (with indefinite lives) are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Furthermore, goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual impairment test. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, which include goodwill and other intangible assets. In addition, certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are also tested separately.\nWe complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill at the reporting unit level and other intangible assets with indefinite lives, and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur. We have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment for each reporting unit to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, which is an indication that our goodwill may be impaired. These qualitative impairment tests include assessing events and factors that could affect the fair value of the indefinite-lived intangible assets. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. If we determine that a reporting unit’s goodwill may be impaired after utilizing these qualitative impairment analysis procedures, we are required to perform a quantitative impairment test.\nOur quantitative impairment test utilizes the projected income and market valuation approaches for goodwill and the projected income approach for our indefinite lived intangible assets. Use of the projected income and market valuation approaches for our goodwill impairment test reflects our view that both valuation methodologies provide a reasonable estimate of fair value. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. These estimated future cash flows are then discounted. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital. Market valuations are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization; and book value of invested capital (debt and equity) and include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry.\nWe did not incur any impairment losses as a result of our 2021 annual impairment tests, as it was determined that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of the carrying values as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we do not believe that the estimated fair values of our reporting units are at risk of becoming impaired in the next twelve months.\nIf estimated fair values are less than the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles with indefinite lives in future annual impairment tests, or if significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.\nFor additional information, see Note 3, “Business Acquisitions” and Note 10, “Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-58-\nInvestments\nCurrent and long-term marketable investment securities were $28,780 at December 31, 2021 and represented 29.5% of our total consolidated assets at December 31, 2021. We classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.\nOur impairment review is subjective and requires a high degree of judgment. We conduct this review on a quarterly basis, using both qualitative and quantitative factors. Such factors considered include the extent to which a security’s market value has been less than its cost, the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors), financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, including the credit ratings and changes in the credit ratings of the issuer, recommendations of investment advisors, and forecasts of economic, market or industry trends.\nPrior to 2020, our fixed maturity securities were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment where credit-related impairments were presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income with an adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Effective January 1, 2020, if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income.\nThe credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.\nWe have a committee of accounting and investment associates and management that is responsible for managing the impairment review process. We believe that we have adequately reviewed our investment securities for impairment and that our investment securities are carried at fair value. We have established an allowance for credit loss and recorded credit loss expense as a reflection of our expected impairment losses. Given the inherent uncertainty of changes in market conditions and the significant judgments involved, there is continuing risk that declines in fair value may occur and additional impairment losses on investments may be recorded in future periods.\nIn addition to marketable investment securities, we held additional long-term investments of $5,225, or 5.4% of total consolidated assets, at December 31, 2021. These long-term investments consisted primarily of certain other equity investments, the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies, mortgage loans and real estate. Due to their less liquid nature, these investments are classified as long-term.\nThrough our investing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in equity market valuations. We manage market risks through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limits and limits on investments in individual issuers. Ineffective management of these risks could have an impact on our future results of operations and financial condition. Our investment portfolio includes fixed maturity securities with a fair value of $26,899 at December 31, 2021. The weighted-average credit rating of these securities was “A”\n-59-\nas of December 31, 2021. Included in this balance are investments in fixed maturity securities of states, municipalities and political subdivisions of $1,095 that are guaranteed by third parties. With the exception of nineteen securities with a fair value of $27, these securities are all investment-grade and carry a weighted-average credit rating of “AA” as of December 31, 2021. The securities are guaranteed by a number of different guarantors, and we do not have any material exposure to any single guarantor, neither indirectly through the guarantees, nor directly through investment in the guarantor. Further, due to the high underlying credit rating of the issuers, the weighted-average credit rating of the fixed maturity securities without a guarantee, for which such information is available, was “A” as of December 31, 2021.\nFair values of fixed maturity and equity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value in accordance with FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable.\nWe obtain quoted market prices for each security from the pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities, making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets for similar securities. Inputs that are often used in these valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nIn certain circumstances, it may not be possible to derive pricing model inputs from observable market activity, and therefore, such inputs are estimated internally. Such securities are designated Level III in accordance with FASB guidance. Securities designated Level III at December 31, 2021 totaled $449 and represented approximately 1.3% of our total assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis. Our Level III securities primarily consisted of certain corporate securities and equity securities for which observable inputs were not always available and the fair values of these securities were estimated using inputs including, but not limited to, prepayment speeds, credit spreads, default rates and benchmark yields.\nFor additional information, see Part II, Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” and Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” Note 5, “Investments,” and Note 7, “Fair Value,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nRetirement Benefits\nPension Benefits\nWe sponsor defined benefit pension plans for some of our employees. These plans are accounted for in accordance with FASB guidance for retirement benefits, which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis. As permitted by the guidance, we calculate the value of plan assets as described below. Further, the difference between our expected rate of return and the actual performance of plan assets, as well as certain changes in pension liabilities, are amortized over future periods.\nAn important factor in determining our pension expense is the assumption for expected long-term return on plan assets. As of our December 31, 2021 measurement date, we selected a weighted-average long-term rate of return on plan assets of 5.02%. We use a total portfolio return analysis in the development of our assumption. Factors such as past market performance, the long-term relationship between fixed maturity and equity securities, interest rates, inflation and asset allocations are considered in the assumption. The assumption includes an estimate of the additional return expected from active management of the investment portfolio. Peer data and an average of historical returns are also reviewed for appropriateness of the selected assumption. We believe our assumption of future returns is reasonable. However, if we lower our expected long-term return on plan assets, future contributions to the pension plan and pension expense would likely increase.\n-60-\nThis assumed long-term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years, producing the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of pension expense. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of pension expense. The net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and, ultimately, future pension expense.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligation. At the December 31, 2021 measurement date, the weighted-average discount rate under the annual spot rate approach was 2.70%, compared to 2.24% at the December 31, 2020 measurement date. The net effect of changes in the discount rate, as well as the net effect of other changes in actuarial assumptions and experience, have been deferred and amortized as a component of pension expense in accordance with FASB guidance.\nIn managing the plan assets, our objective is to be a responsible fiduciary while minimizing financial risk. Plan assets include a diversified mix of equity securities, investment grade fixed maturity securities and other types of investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize long-term return for a prudent level of risk. In addition to producing a reasonable return, the investment strategy seeks to minimize the volatility in our expense and cash flow.\nOther Postretirement Benefits\nWe provide some associates with certain medical, vision and dental benefits upon retirement. We use various actuarial assumptions, including a discount rate and the expected trend in healthcare costs, to estimate the costs and benefit obligations for our retiree benefits.\nAt our December 31, 2021 measurement date, the selected discount rate for all plans was 2.49%, compared to a discount rate of 1.99% at the December 31, 2020 measurement rate. We developed this rate using the annual spot rate approach as described above.\nThe assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2021 measurement date was 7.00% for 2022 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2033. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2021 measurement date was 5.50% for 2022 with a gradual decline to 4.50% by the year 2033. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future.\nFor additional information regarding our retirement benefits, see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nFor information regarding new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2021 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations or financial statement disclosures, see the “\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\n” and “\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted\n” sections of Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nIntroduction\nOur cash receipts result primarily from premiums, product revenue, administrative fees and other revenue, investment income, proceeds from the sale or maturity of our investment securities, proceeds from borrowings, and proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our employee stock plans. Cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments,\n-61-\nadministrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. Cash outflows fluctuate with the amount and timing of settlement of these transactions. Any future decline in our profitability would likely have an unfavorable impact on our liquidity.\nWe manage our cash, investments and capital structure so we are able to meet the short-term and long-term obligations of our business while maintaining financial flexibility and liquidity. We forecast, analyze and monitor our cash flows to enable investment and financing within the overall constraints of our financial strategy.\nA substantial portion of the assets held by our regulated subsidiaries are in the form of cash and cash equivalents and investments. After considering expected cash flows from operating activities, we generally invest cash that exceeds our near term obligations in longer term marketable fixed maturity securities to improve our overall investment income returns. Our investment strategy is to make investments consistent with insurance statutes and other regulatory requirements, while preserving our asset base. Our investments are generally available-for-sale to meet liquidity and other needs. Our subsidiaries pay out excess capital annually in the form of dividends to their respective parent companies for general corporate use, as permitted by applicable regulations.\nThe availability of financing in the form of debt or equity is influenced by many factors, including our profitability, operating cash flows, debt levels, debt ratings, contractual restrictions, regulatory requirements and market conditions. The securities and credit markets have in the past experienced higher than normal volatility, although current market conditions are more stable. Interest rates on fixed income securities are expected to rise in 2022, which could increase our borrowing costs if we elect to issue debt. During recent years, the federal government and various governmental agencies have taken a number of steps to strengthen the regulation of the financial services market. In addition, governments around the world have developed their own plans to provide stability and security in the credit markets and to ensure adequate capital in certain financial institutions. Further, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the federal government has established a number of programs to provide liquidity to the financial system that provides lending to states, municipalities, and eligible businesses.\nA summary of our major sources and uses of cash and cash equivalents for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n-62-\nLiquidity—Year Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to Year Ended December 31, 2020\nThe decrease in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to the impact of working capital changes year-over-year, including an increase in receivables and a decline in accounts payable and accrued expenses, partially offset by higher net income in 2021.\nOther significant changes in sources and uses of cash year-over-year included an increase in net proceeds received from the issuance of commercial paper and short-term and long-term debt, net of repayments and reduced amounts for the repurchase and retirement of our common stock, partially offset by an increase in cash paid for the purchases of subsidiaries, net of cash acquired.\nFinancial Condition\nWe maintained a strong financial condition and liquidity position, with consolidated cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities of $33,660 at December 31, 2021. Since December 31, 2020, total cash, cash equivalents and investments in fixed maturity and equity securities increased by $2,365, primarily due to cash generated from operations. This increase was partially offset by cash used for acquisitions, common stock repurchases, purchases of property and equipment and cash dividends paid to shareholders.\nMany of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid to their respective parent companies. Certain accounting practices prescribed by insurance regulatory authorities, or statutory accounting practices, differ from GAAP. Changes that occur in statutory accounting practices, if any, could impact our subsidiaries’ future dividend capacity. In addition, we have agreed to certain undertakings to regulatory authorities, including the requirement to maintain certain capital levels in certain of our subsidiaries.\nAt December 31, 2021, we held $1,194 of cash, cash equivalents and investments at the parent company, which are available for general corporate use, including investment in our businesses, acquisitions, potential future common stock repurchases and dividends to shareholders, repurchases of debt securities and debt and interest payments.\nPeriodically, we access capital markets and issue debt (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes, for example, to refinance debt, to finance acquisitions or for share repurchases. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating. For more information on our debt, including redemptions and issuances, see Note 13, “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nWe calculate our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio, a non-GAAP measure, from the amounts presented on our audited consolidated balance sheets included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. Our debt-to-capital ratio is calculated as total debt divided by total debt plus total shareholders’ equity. Total debt is the sum of short-term borrowings, current portion of long-term debt and long-term debt, less current portion. We believe our debt-to-capital ratio assists investors and rating agencies in measuring our overall leverage and additional borrowing capacity. In addition, our bank covenants include a maximum debt-to-capital ratio that we cannot and did not exceed. Our debt-to-capital ratio may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies. Our consolidated debt-to-capital ratio was 38.9% and 37.6% as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur senior debt is rated “A” by S&P Global, “BBB” by Fitch Ratings, Inc., “Baa2” by Moody’s Investor Service, Inc. and “bbb+” by AM Best Company, Inc. We intend to maintain our senior debt investment grade ratings. If our credit ratings are downgraded, our business, financial condition and results of operations could be adversely impacted by limitations on future borrowings and a potential increase in our borrowing costs.\nCapital Resources\nWe have a shelf registration statement on file with the SEC to register an unlimited amount of any combination of debt or equity securities in one or more offerings. Specific information regarding terms and securities being offered will be provided at the time of an offering. Proceeds from future offerings are expected to be used for general corporate purposes,\n-63-\nincluding, but not limited to, the repayment of debt, investments in or extensions of credit to our subsidiaries and the financing of possible acquisitions or business expansions.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) available in the amount of $2,500 with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. On June 3, 2021, we terminated our 364-day senior revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in June 2021 (the “prior 364-Day Facility”), and entered into a new 364-day senior revolving credit facility (the “new 364-Day Facility” and together with the 5-Year Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The new 364-Day Facility provides for credit in the amount of $1,000 and matures in June 2022. Our ability to borrow under these Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement. We do not believe the restrictions contained in these covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of our debt covenants. There were no amounts outstanding under the 5-Year Facility or the new 364-Day Facility at December 31, 2021.\nThrough certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit (the “Subsidiary Credit Facilities”) with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The Subsidiary Credit Facilities provide combined credit up to $200. Our ability to borrow under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding borrowings under the Subsidiary Credit Facilities.\nWe have a $3,500 commercial paper program, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. Should commercial paper issuance be unavailable, we have the ability to use a combination of cash on hand and/or our Credit Facilities, which provide for combined credit in the amount of $3,500, to redeem any outstanding commercial paper upon maturity. While there is no assurance in the current economic environment, we believe the lenders participating in our credit facilities, if market conditions allow, would be willing to provide financing in accordance with their legal obligations. At December 31, 2021, we had $300 outstanding under our commercial paper program.\nWe are a member, through certain subsidiaries, of the Federal Home Loan Bank of Indianapolis, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Cincinnati, the Federal Home Loan Bank of Atlanta and the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, collectively (the “FHLBs”). As a member, we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2021, we had $275 outstanding short-term borrowings from the FHLBs.\nAs discussed in “\nFinancial Condition\n” above, many of our subsidiaries are subject to various government regulations that restrict the timing and amount of dividends and other distributions that may be paid. Based upon these requirements, we currently estimate that approximately $3,000 of dividends will be paid to the parent company during 2022. During 2021, we received $3,134 of dividends from our subsidiaries.\nIn addition to regulations regarding the timing and amount of dividends, our regulated subsidiaries’ states of domicile have statutory risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements for health and other insurance companies and HMOs largely based on the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) Risk-Based Capital (RBC) For Health Organizations Model Act (“RBC Model Act”). These RBC requirements are intended to measure capital adequacy, taking into account the risk characteristics of an insurer’s investments and products. The NAIC sets forth the formula for calculating the RBC requirements, which are designed to take into account asset risks, insurance risks, interest rate risks and other relevant risks with respect to an individual insurance company’s business. In general, under the RBC Model Act, an insurance company must submit a report of its RBC level to the state insurance department or insurance commissioner, as appropriate, at the end of each calendar year. Our regulated subsidiaries’ respective RBC levels as of December 31, 2021, which was the most recent date for which reporting was required, were in excess of all applicable mandatory RBC requirements. In addition to exceeding these RBC requirements, we are in compliance with the liquidity and capital requirements for a licensee of the BCBSA and with the tangible net worth requirements applicable to certain of our California subsidiaries. For additional information, see Note 22, “Statutory Information,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-64-\nFuture Sources and Uses of Liquidity\nShort-Term Liquidity Requirements\nAs previously described, our cash disbursements result mainly from claims payments, administrative expenses, taxes, purchases of investment securities, interest expense, payments on borrowings, acquisitions, capital expenditures, repurchases of our debt securities and common stock and the payment of cash dividends. We believe cash on hand, operating cash receipts, investments and amounts available under our commercial paper and Credit Facilities will be adequate to fund our expected cash disbursements over the next twelve months.\nLong-Term Liquidity Requirements\nAs of December 31, 2021, our long-term cash disbursements required under various contractual obligations and commitments were:\n•\nDebt and interest expense:\nFuture debt and estimated interest payments were $24,412, with $2,935 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 13 “Debt” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nOperating leases:\nWe lease office space and certain computer equipment, for which the future estimated payments were $1,092, with $211 due within the next twelve months. For additional information, see Note 18 “Leases” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nOther liabilities:\nThese liabilities primarily consist of future policy reserves, projected other postretirement benefits, deferred compensation, supplemental executive retirement plan liabilities and certain other miscellaneous long-term obligations. Amounts due within twelve months were $29, with $1,233 due in future periods. Estimated future payments for funded pension benefits have been excluded from these numbers, as we had no funding requirements under the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, at December 31, 2021, as a result of the value of the assets in the plans. In addition, gross liabilities for uncertain tax positions and interest for which we cannot reasonably estimate the timing of the resolutions with the respective taxing authorities have not been included. For further information, see Note 8, “Income Taxes,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nPurchase obligations:\nThese obligations include estimated payments for future services under contractual arrangements from third-party service vendors. Amounts due within the next twelve months for these purchase obligations were $886, while longer term payments were $5,048. For further information, see Note 14, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n•\nInvestment commitments:\nThese include unfunded capital commitments for alternative investments and low-income housing tax credits. Estimated amounts due were $1,558, including $249 due within the next twelve months.\nIn addition to the contractual obligations and commitments discussed above, we have a variety of other contractual agreements related to acquiring materials and services used in our operations. However, we do not believe these other agreements contain material noncancelable commitments.\nWe regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nOn January 25, 2022, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $1.28 per share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on March 25, 2022 to the shareholders of record as of March 10, 2022.\nUnder our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. On January 26, 2021, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized a $5,000 increase to our common stock repurchase program.

    "text": "(In Millions, Except As Otherwise Stated Herein)\nAs a result of our investing and borrowing activities, we are exposed to financial market risks, including those resulting from changes in interest rates and changes in market valuations. Potential impacts discussed below are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of December 31, 2021. Actual results could vary from these estimates. Our primary objectives with our investment portfolio are to provide safety and preservation of capital, sufficient liquidity to meet cash flow requirements, the integration of investment strategy with the business operations and an attainment of a competitive after-tax total return.\nInvestments\nOur investment portfolio is exposed to three primary sources of risk: credit quality risk, interest rate risk and market valuation risk.\nThe primary risks associated with our fixed maturity securities, which are classified as available-for-sale, are credit quality risk and interest rate risk. Credit quality risk is defined as the risk of a credit event, such as a ratings downgrade or default, to an individual fixed maturity security and the potential loss attributable to that event. Credit quality risk is managed through our investment policy, which establishes credit quality limitations on the overall portfolio as well as diversification and percentage limits on securities of individual issuers. The result is a well-diversified portfolio of fixed maturity securities, with an average credit rating of approximately “A.” Interest rate risk is defined as the potential for economic losses on fixed maturity securities due to a change in market interest rates. Our fixed maturity portfolio is invested primarily in U.S. government securities, corporate bonds, asset-backed bonds, mortgage-related securities and municipal bonds, all of which have exposure to changes in the level of market interest rates. Interest rate risk is managed by maintaining asset duration within a band based upon our liabilities, operating performance and liquidity needs. Additionally, we have the capability of holding any security to maturity, which would allow us to realize full par value.\nInvestments in fixed maturity securities include corporate securities, which account for 46.0% of our total fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 and are subject to credit/default risk. In a declining economic environment, corporate yields will usually increase, prompted by concern over the ability of corporations to make interest payments, thus causing a decrease in the price of corporate securities, and the decline in value of the corporate fixed maturity portfolio. We manage this risk through fundamental credit analysis, diversification of issuers and industries and an average credit rating of our corporate fixed maturity portfolio of approximately “BBB.”\nMarket risk for fixed maturity securities is addressed by actively managing the duration, allocation and diversification of our investment portfolio. We have evaluated the impact on the fixed maturity portfolio’s fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,114 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $1,152 increase in fair value. While we classify our fixed maturity securities as “available-for-sale” for accounting purposes, we believe our cash flows and the duration of our portfolio should allow us to hold securities to maturity, thereby avoiding the recognition of losses should interest rates rise significantly.\nOur equity portfolio is comprised of large capitalization and small capitalization domestic equities, foreign equities, exchange-traded funds and index mutual funds. Our equity portfolio is subject to the volatility inherent in the stock market,\n-66-\ndriven by concerns over economic conditions, earnings and sales growth, inflation, and consumer confidence. These systemic risks cannot be managed through diversification alone. However, more routine risks, such as stock/industry specific risks, are managed by investing in a diversified equity portfolio.\nOur other invested assets, reported within our long-term investments, are primarily subject to private market exposures, including private equity, real estate, and private credit investments. These investments are also indirectly subject to market valuation risk, as public market valuations will form a basis for valuations for these investments. Given their illiquid nature, we focus on appropriate sizing of these investments relative to our liquidity needs and risk tolerance. Our risk tolerance is formed by the level of illiquidity and short-term price movements from market valuation risk we are willing to accept relative to the higher long-term expected returns over the life of these investments.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 6.5% of our marketable investments were equity securities. An immediate 10% decrease in each equity investment’s value, arising from market movement, would result in a fair value decrease of $188. Alternatively, an immediate 10% increase in each equity investment’s value, attributable to the same factor, would result in a fair value increase of $188.\nFor additional information regarding our investments, see Note 5, “Investments,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 and “Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates -\nInvestments\n” within Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nLong-Term Debt\nOur total long-term debt at December 31, 2021 consisted of senior unsecured notes, convertible debentures, commercial paper and subordinated surplus notes issued by one of our insurance subsidiaries. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term debt was $22,756 and $26,136, respectively. This debt is subject to interest rate risk, as these instruments have fixed interest rates and the fair value is affected by changes in market interest rates. Should interest rates increase or decrease in the future, the estimated fair value of our fixed rate debt would decrease or increase accordingly.\nFor additional information regarding our long-term debt, see Note 7, “Fair Value” and Note 13, “Debt,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nDerivatives\nWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through the use of derivative financial instruments. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-in interest rates or to hedge (on an economic basis) interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.\nChanges in interest rates will affect the estimated fair value of these derivatives. As of December 31, 2021, we recorded a net asset of $18, the estimated fair value of the swaps at that date. We have evaluated the impact on the interest rate swaps’ fair value considering an immediate 100 basis point change in interest rates. A 100 basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate $32 decrease in fair value, whereas a 100 basis point decrease in interest rates would result in an approximate $32 increase in fair value.\nFor additional information regarding our derivatives, see Note 6, “Derivative Financial Instruments” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n-67-"

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity, and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 16, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of the critical audit matter does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the account or disclosures to which it relates.\n-69-\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1944.\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nFebruary 16, 2022\n-70-\nAnthem, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes.\n-71-\nAnthem, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\nSee accompanying notes.\n-72-\nAnthem, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nSee accompanying notes.\n-73-\nAnthem, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes.\n-74-\nAnthem, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity\nSee accompanying notes.\n-75-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDecember 31, 2021\n(In Millions, Except Per Share Data or As Otherwise Stated Herein)\n1.\nOrganization\nReferences to the terms “we,” “our,” “us” or “Anthem” used throughout these Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements refer to Anthem, Inc., an Indiana corporation, and unless the context otherwise requires, its direct and indirect subsidiaries.\nWe are one of the largest health benefits companies in the United States in terms of medical membership, serving greater than\n45\nmillion medical members through our affiliated health plans as of December 31, 2021. We offer a broad spectrum of network-based managed care risk-based plans to Individual, Group, Medicaid and Medicare markets. In addition, we provide a broad array of managed care services to fee-based customers, including claims processing, stop loss insurance, provider network access, medical management, care management and wellness programs, actuarial services and other administrative services. We also provide services to the federal government in connection with our Federal Health Products & Services business, which administers the Federal Employees Health Benefits (“FEHB”) Program. We provide an array of specialty services both to our subsidiary health plans and also unaffiliated health plans, including pharmacy benefit management (“PBM”) services and dental, vision, life, disability and supplemental health insurance benefits, as well as integrated health services.\nWe are an independent licensee of the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association (“BCBSA”), an association of independent health benefit plans. We serve our members as the Blue Cross licensee for California and as the Blue Cross and Blue Shield (“BCBS”) licensee for Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maine, Missouri (excluding\n30\ncounties in the Kansas City area), Nevada, New Hampshire, New York (in the New York City metropolitan area and upstate New York), Ohio, Virginia (excluding the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington, D.C.) and Wisconsin. In a majority of these service areas, we do business as Anthem Blue Cross, Anthem Blue Cross and Blue Shield, and Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield or Empire Blue Cross. We also conduct business through arrangements with other BCBS licensees as well as other strategic partners. Through our subsidiaries, we also serve customers in numerous states and Puerto Rico as AIM Specialty Health, Amerigroup, Aspire Health, Beacon, CareMore, Freedom Health, HealthLink, HealthSun, MMM, Optimum HealthCare, Simply Healthcare, and/or UniCare. PBM services are offered through our IngenioRx, Inc. (“IngenioRx”) subsidiary. We are licensed to conduct insurance operations in all\n50\nstates, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico through our subsidiaries.\n2.\nBasis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation:\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Anthem and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain of our subsidiaries operate outside of the United States and have functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar (“USD”). We translate the assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries to USD using the exchange rate in effect at the end of the period. We translate the revenues and expenses of those subsidiaries to USD using the average exchange rates in effect during the period. The net effect of these translation adjustments is included in “Foreign currency translation adjustments” in our consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nReclassifications:\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our most significant estimate relates to estimates and judgments for medical claims payable. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n-76-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nCash and cash equivalents includes available cash and all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased. We control a number of bank accounts that are used exclusively to hold customer funds for the administration of customer benefits, and we have cash and cash equivalents on deposit to meet certain regulatory requirements. These amounts totaled $\n173\nand $\n170\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in the cash and cash equivalents line on our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestments:\nWe classify fixed maturity securities in our investment portfolio as “available-for-sale” and report those securities at fair value. Certain fixed maturity securities are available to support current operations and, accordingly, we classify such investments as current assets without regard to their contractual maturity. Investments used to satisfy contractual, regulatory or other requirements are classified as long-term, without regard to contractual maturity.\nPrior to 2020, our fixed maturity securities were evaluated for other-than-temporary impairment where credit-related impairments were presented within the other-than-temporary impairment losses recognized in our consolidated statements of income with an adjustment to the security’s amortized cost basis. Effective January 1, 2020, if a fixed maturity security is in an unrealized loss position and we have the intent to sell the fixed maturity security, or it is more likely than not that we will have to sell the fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we write down the fixed maturity security’s cost basis to fair value and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. For impaired fixed maturity securities that we do not intend to sell or if it is more likely than not that we will not have to sell such securities, but we expect that we will not fully recover the amortized cost basis, we recognize the credit component of the impairment as an allowance for credit loss in our consolidated balance sheets and record an impairment loss in our consolidated statements of income. The non-credit component of the impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income. Furthermore, unrealized losses entirely caused by non-credit-related factors related to fixed maturity securities for which we expect to fully recover the amortized cost basis continue to be recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income.\nThe credit component of an impairment is determined primarily by comparing the net present value of projected future cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the fixed maturity security. The net present value is calculated by discounting our best estimate of projected future cash flows at the effective interest rate implicit in the fixed maturity security at the date of purchase. For mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, cash flow estimates are based on assumptions regarding the underlying collateral, including prepayment speeds, vintage, type of underlying asset, geographic concentrations, default rates, recoveries and changes in value. For all other securities, cash flow estimates are driven by assumptions regarding probability of default, including changes in credit ratings and estimates regarding timing and amount of recoveries associated with a default.\nFor asset-backed securities included in fixed maturity securities, we recognize income using an effective yield based on anticipated prepayments and the estimated economic life of the securities. When estimates of prepayments change, the effective yield is recalculated to reflect actual payments to date and anticipated future payments. The net investment in the securities is adjusted to the amount that would have existed had the new effective yield been applied since the purchase date of the securities. Such adjustments are reported within net investment income.\nThe changes in fair value of our marketable equity securities are recognized in our results of operations within net gains and losses on financial instruments. Certain marketable equity securities are held to satisfy contractual obligations, and are reported under the caption “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe have corporate-owned life insurance policies on certain participants in our deferred compensation plans and other members of management. The cash surrender value of the corporate-owned life insurance policies is reported under the caption “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nWe use the equity method of accounting for investments in companies in which our ownership interest may enable us to influence the operating or financial decisions of the investee company. Our proportionate share of equity in net income of these unconsolidated affiliates is reported within net investment income. The equity method investments are reported under the caption “Other invested assets” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nInvestment income is recorded when earned. All securities sold resulting in investment realized gains and losses are recorded on the trade date. Realized gains and losses are determined on the basis of the cost or amortized cost of the specific securities sold.\n-77-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nWe participate in securities lending programs whereby marketable securities in our investment portfolio are transferred to independent brokers or dealers in exchange for cash and securities collateral. Under Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance related to accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities, we recognize the collateral as an asset, which is reported in other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets, and we record a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower, which is reported in other current liabilities. The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on our consolidated balance sheets. Unrealized gains or losses on securities lending collateral are included in accumulated other comprehensive income as a separate component of shareholders’ equity. The market value of loaned securities and that of the collateral pledged can fluctuate in non-synchronized fashions. To the extent the loaned securities’ value appreciates faster or depreciates slower than the value of the collateral pledged, we are exposed to the risk of the shortfall. As a primary mitigating mechanism, the loaned securities and collateral pledged are marked to market on a daily basis and the shortfall, if any, is collected accordingly. Secondarily, the collateral level is set at\n102\n% of the value of the loaned securities, which provides a cushion before any shortfall arises. The investment of the cash collateral is subject to market risk, which is managed by limiting the investments to higher quality and shorter duration instruments.\nReceivables:\nReceivables are reported net of amounts for expected credit losses. The allowance for doubtful accounts is based on historical collection trends, future forecasts and our judgment regarding the ability to collect specific accounts.\nPremium receivables include the uncollected amounts from insured groups, individuals and government programs. Premium receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n142\nand $\n146\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nSelf-funded receivables include administrative fees, claims and other amounts due from fee-based customers. Self-funded receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n50\nand $\n54\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOther receivables include pharmacy rebates, provider advances, claims recoveries, reinsurance receivables, proceeds due from brokers on investment trades, accrued investment income and other miscellaneous amounts due to us. These receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n648\nand $\n374\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nIncome Taxes:\nWe file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return. Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial statement and tax return basis of assets and liabilities based on enacted tax rates and laws and are reported net on our consolidated balance sheets. The deferred tax benefits of the deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent realization of such benefits is more likely than not. Deferred income tax expense or benefit generally represents the net change in deferred income tax assets and liabilities during the year, excluding the impact from amounts initially recorded for business combinations, if any, and amounts recorded to accumulated other comprehensive income. Current income tax expense represents the tax consequences of revenues and expenses currently taxable or deductible on various income tax returns for the year reported.\nThe Internal Revenue Code subjects a U.S. shareholder to tax on Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. We have elected to account for GILTI tax in the year the tax is incurred.\nWe account for income tax contingencies in accordance with FASB guidance that contains a model to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold, which all income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements.\nProperty and Equipment:\nProperty and equipment is recorded at cost, net of accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed principally by the straight-line method over estimated useful lives ranging from\nfifteen\nto\nthirty-nine\nyears for buildings and improvements,\nthree\nto\nfive\nyears for computer equipment and software, and the lesser of the remaining life of the building lease, if any, or\nseven\nyears for furniture and other equipment.\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the term of the related lease.\nCertain costs related to the development or purchase of internal-use software are capitalized and amortized over estimated useful lives ranging from\nthree\nto\nten\nyears.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets:\nFASB guidance requires business combinations to be accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting, and it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair\n-78-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nvalue of net assets acquired. Other intangible assets represent the values assigned to customer relationships, provider and hospital networks, Blue Cross and Blue Shield and other trademarks, licenses and other agreements, such as non-compete agreements. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reportable segments based on the relative fair value of the components of the businesses acquired.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are tested for impairment at least annually. Goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated to reporting units for purposes of the annual goodwill impairment test. Other intangible assets with indefinite lives, such as trademarks, are tested for impairment separately. We complete our annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during the fourth quarter of each year. Our impairment tests require us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the estimated fair value of our reporting units, including goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives. Certain interim impairment tests are also performed when potential impairment indicators exist or changes in our business or other triggering events occur.\nFASB guidance allows for qualitative assessments of whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount for purposes of a goodwill impairment analysis and whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired for purposes of an indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment analysis. Estimated fair values developed based on our assumptions and judgments might be different if other reasonable assumptions and estimates were to be used. Qualitative analysis involves assessing situations and developments that could affect key drivers used to evaluate whether the fair value of our goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are impaired. Our procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors, and entity specific events.\nQuantitative analysis must be performed if qualitative analyses are not conclusive. Entities also have the option to bypass the assessment of qualitative factors and proceed directly to performing quantitative analyses. Fair value for purposes of a quantitative goodwill impairment test is calculated using a blend of the projected income and market valuation approaches. The projected income approach is developed using assumptions about future revenue, expenses and net income derived from our internal planning process. Our assumed discount rate is based on our industry’s weighted-average cost of capital and reflects volatility associated with the cost of equity capital. Market valuations include market comparisons to publicly traded companies in our industry and are based on observed multiples of certain measures including revenue; earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (“EBITDA”); and book value of invested capital.\nA goodwill impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset’s fair value. This determination consists of a one step test comparing the fair value of a reporting unit, including goodwill, to its carrying amount. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. This goodwill impairment loss is equal to the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its fair value.\nFair value for purposes of a quantitative impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets is estimated using a projected income approach. We recognize an impairment loss when the estimated fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is less than the carrying value. If significant impairment indicators are noted relative to other intangible assets subject to amortization, we may be required to record impairment losses against future income.\nDerivative Financial Instruments:\nWe primarily invest in the following types of derivative financial instruments: interest rate swaps, futures, forward contracts, put and call options, collars, swaptions, embedded derivatives and warrants. Derivatives embedded within non-derivative instruments, such as options embedded in convertible fixed maturity securities, are bifurcated from the host instrument when the embedded derivative is not clearly and closely related to the host instrument. Our use of derivatives is limited by statutes and regulations promulgated by the various regulatory bodies to which we are subject, and by our own derivative policy. Our derivative use is generally limited to hedging purposes, on an economic basis, and we generally do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nWe have exposure to economic losses due to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates. We attempt to mitigate our exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management, including rebalancing our existing portfolios of assets and liabilities, as well as changing the characteristics of investments to be purchased or sold in the future. In addition, derivative financial instruments are used to modify the interest rate exposure of certain liabilities or forecasted transactions. These strategies include the use of interest rate swaps and forward contracts, which are used to lock-\n-79-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nin interest rates or to hedge, on an economic basis, interest rate risks associated with variable rate debt. We have used these types of instruments as designated hedges against specific liabilities.\nAll investments in derivatives are recorded as assets or liabilities at fair value. If certain correlation, hedge effectiveness and risk reduction criteria are met, a derivative may be specifically designated as a hedge of exposure to changes in fair value or cash flow. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the nature of any hedge designation thereon. Amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness, if any, are reported in results of operations immediately. If the derivative is not designated as a hedge, the gain or loss resulting from the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in results of operations in the period of change. Cash flows associated with the settlement of non-designated derivatives are shown on a net basis in investing activity in our consolidated statements of cash flow.\nFrom time to time, we may also purchase derivatives to hedge, on an economic basis, our exposure to foreign currency exchange fluctuations associated with the operations of certain of our subsidiaries. We generally use futures or forward contracts for these transactions. We generally do not designate these contracts as hedges and, accordingly, the changes in fair value of these derivatives are recognized in results of operations immediately.\nCredit exposure associated with non-performance by the counterparties to derivative instruments is generally limited to the uncollateralized fair value of the asset related to instruments recognized in the consolidated balance sheets. We attempt to mitigate the risk of non-performance by selecting counterparties with high credit ratings and monitoring their creditworthiness and by diversifying derivatives among multiple counterparties. At December 31, 2021, we believe there were no material concentrations of credit risk with any individual counterparty.\nWe generally enter into master netting agreements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Certain of our derivative agreements also contain credit support provisions that require us or the counterparty to post collateral if there are declines in the derivative fair value or our credit rating. The derivative assets and derivative liabilities are reported at their fair values net of collateral and netting by the counterparty.\nRetirement Benefits:\nWe recognize the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans on the consolidated balance sheets based on fiscal-year-end measurements of plan assets and benefit obligations. Prepaid pension benefits represent prepaid costs related to defined benefit pension plans and are reported with other noncurrent assets. Postretirement benefits represent outstanding obligations for retiree medical, life, vision and dental benefits. Liabilities for pension and other postretirement benefits are reported with noncurrent assets, current liabilities and noncurrent liabilities based on the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits payable in the next twelve months included in the benefit obligation exceeds the fair value of plan assets.\nWe determine the expected return on plan assets using the calculated value of plan assets, which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over three years. We apply a corridor approach to amortize unrecognized actuarial gains or losses. Under this approach, only accumulated net actuarial gains or losses in excess of 10% of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the fair value of plan assets are amortized over the average remaining service or lifetime of the workforce as a component of net periodic benefit cost.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year based on our most recent measurement date. We use the annual spot rate approach for setting our discount rate. Under the spot rate approach, individual spot rates from a full yield curve of published rates are used to discount each plan’s cash flows to determine the plan’s obligations.\nThe assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of other postretirement benefits are based on an initial assumed healthcare cost trend rate declining to an ultimate healthcare cost trend rate over a select number of years.\nMedical Claims Payable:\nLiabilities for medical claims payable include estimated provisions for incurred but not paid claims on an undiscounted basis, as well as estimated provisions for expenses related to the processing of claims. Incurred but not paid claims include (1) an estimate for claims that are incurred but not reported, as well as claims reported to us but not yet processed through our systems; and (2) claims reported to us and processed through our systems but not yet paid.\n-80-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLiabilities for both claims incurred but not reported and reported but not yet processed through our systems are determined in the aggregate, employing actuarial methods that are commonly used by health insurance actuaries and meet Actuarial Standards of Practice. Our reserving practice for claim liabilities is to consistently recognize the appropriate amount of reserve within a level of confidence required by Actuarial Standards of Practice. We determine the amount of the liability for incurred but not paid claims by following a detailed actuarial process that uses both historical claim payment patterns as well as emerging medical cost trends to project our best estimate of claim liabilities. Under this process, historical paid claims data is formatted into “claim triangles,” which compare claim incurred dates to the dates of claim payments. This information is analyzed to create “completion factors” that represent the average percentage of total incurred claims that have been paid through a given date after being incurred. Completion factors are applied to claims paid through the period-end date to estimate the ultimate claim expense incurred for the period. Actuarial estimates of incurred but not paid claim liabilities are then determined by subtracting the actual paid claims from the estimate of the ultimate incurred claims.\nFor the most recent incurred months (typically the most recent two months), the percentage of claims paid for claims incurred in those months is generally low. This makes the completion factor methodology less reliable for such months. Therefore, incurred claims for recent months are not projected from historical completion and payment patterns; rather, they are projected by estimating the claims expense for those months based on recent claims expense levels and healthcare trend levels (“trend factors”).\nWe regularly review and set assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization when initially establishing claim liabilities. We continually monitor and adjust the claims liability and benefit expense based on subsequent paid claims activity. If it is determined that our assumptions regarding cost trends and utilization are materially different than actual results, our income statement and financial position could be impacted in future periods.\nPremium deficiencies are recognized when it is probable that expected claims and administrative expenses will exceed future premiums on existing medical insurance contracts without consideration of investment income. Determination of premium deficiencies for longer duration life and disability contracts includes consideration of investment income. For purposes of premium deficiencies, contracts are deemed to be either short or long duration and are grouped in a manner consistent with our method of acquiring, servicing and measuring the profitability of such contracts. Once established, premium deficiencies are released commensurate with actual claims experience over the remaining life of the contract. No premium deficiencies were established at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nBenefit expense includes incurred medical claims as well as quality improvement expenses for our risk-based members. Quality improvement activities are those designed to improve member health outcomes, prevent hospital readmissions and improve patient safety. They also include expenses for wellness and health promotion provided to our members.\nOther Policyholder Liabilities:\nOther policyholder liabilities include rate stabilization reserves associated with retrospectively rated insurance contracts and certain case-specific reserves. Other policyholder liabilities also include liabilities for premium refunds based upon the minimum medical loss ratio (“MLR”), the relative health risk of members, and other contractual or regulatory requirements. Rate stabilization reserves represent accumulated premiums that exceed what customers owe us based on actual claim experience. The timing of payment of these retrospectively rated refunds is based on the contractual terms with our customers and can vary from period to period based on the specific contractual requirements.\nWe are required to meet certain minimum MLR thresholds prescribed by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, as amended (collectively the “ACA”). If we do not meet or exceed the minimum MLR thresholds specified by the ACA, we are required to pay rebates to certain customers. Minimum MLR rebates are calculated by subsidiary, state and applicable line of business in accordance with regulations issued by the Department of Health and Human Services (“HHS”). Such calculations are made using estimated calendar year medical loss expense and premiums, as defined by HHS.\nWe follow HHS guidelines for determining the types of expenses that may be included in our minimum MLR rebate calculations, which differ from benefit expense and premiums as reported in our consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with GAAP. Certain amounts reported as expense in our consolidated GAAP financial statements may be reported as a reduction of premiums in accordance with HHS regulations. In addition, profit amounts included in our payments to third-party administrative service providers are recorded as benefit expense in our consolidated GAAP financial\n-81-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nstatements, while HHS does not allow for the inclusion of these expenses within the medical loss expense for purposes of calculating minimum MLR.\nReserves for Future Policy Benefits:\nReserves for future policy benefits include liabilities for life and long-term disability insurance policy benefits based upon interest, mortality and morbidity assumptions from published actuarial tables, modified based upon our experience. Future policy benefits also include liabilities for insurance policies for which some of the premiums received in earlier years are intended to pay anticipated benefits to be incurred in future years. Future policy benefits are continually monitored and reviewed, and when reserves are adjusted, differences are reflected in benefit expense.\nWe believe that our liabilities for future policy benefits, along with future premiums received, are adequate to satisfy our ultimate benefit liability; however, these estimates are inherently subject to a number of variable circumstances. Consequently, the actual results could differ materially from the amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition:\nPremiums for risk-based contracts are recognized as revenue over the period insurance coverage is provided, and, if applicable, net of amounts recognized for MLR rebates, risk adjustment, reinsurance and risk corridor under contractual premium stabilization arrangements, the ACA or other regulatory requirements. Premium payments from contracted government agencies are based on eligibility lists produced by the government agencies. Premiums related to the unexpired contractual coverage periods are reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as unearned income. Premiums include revenue adjustments for retrospectively rated contracts where revenue is based on the estimated loss experience of the contract. Premium rates for certain lines of business are subject to approval by the Department of Insurance of each respective state. Additionally, delays in annual premium rate changes from contracted government agencies require that we defer the recognition of any increases to the period in which the premium rates become final. The value of the impact can be significant in the period in which it is recognized depending on the magnitude of the premium rate increase, the membership to which it applies and the length of the delay between the effective date of the rate increase and the final contract date. Premium rate decreases are recognized in the period the change in premium rate becomes effective and the change in the rate is known, which may be prior to the period when the contract amendment affecting the rate is finalized.\nAdministrative fees and other revenue include revenue from certain group contracts that provide for the group to be at risk for all, or with supplemental insurance arrangements, a portion, of their claims experience. We charge these fee-based groups an administrative fee, which is based on the number of members in a group or the group’s claim experience. In addition, administrative fees and other revenue include amounts received for the administration of Medicare or certain other government programs. Under our fee-based arrangements, revenue is recognized as administrative services are performed. All benefit payments under these programs are excluded from benefit expense.\nProduct revenue includes revenue for services performed by our IngenioRx PBM for unaffiliated PBM customers. Unaffiliated PBM customers include our fee-based groups that have contracted with IngenioRx for PBM services and, beginning on January 1, 2020, third-party health plans. Product revenues and costs of goods sold for our affiliated health plans are eliminated in consolidation. Product revenue for PBM services is recognized using the gross method at the negotiated contract price when IngenioRx has concluded that it is the principal and it controls the services before prescription drugs are transferred to the customer. IngenioRx determined it is the principal due to its contractual rights to design and develop a listing of prescription drugs offered to the customer (formulary management); its control over establishing the pharmacy network available to the customer to have its prescription fulfilled (network management); and its discretion over establishing the pricing for prescription drugs. Overall, control over these activities indicate IngenioRx is primarily responsible for fulfilling the promise to provide PBM services. Product revenue includes ingredient costs (net of any rebates or discounts), including any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer, and administrative fees. IngenioRx recognizes revenue when control of the prescription drugs is transferred to customers, in an amount it expects to be entitled to in exchange for the products or services provided.\nFor our non-risk-based contracts, we had no material contract assets, contract liabilities or deferred contract costs recorded on our consolidated balance sheet at December 31, 2021. Revenue recognized in 2021 and 2020 from performance obligations related to prior years, such as due to changes in transaction price, was not material. For contracts that have an original expected duration of greater than one year, revenue expected to be recognized in future periods related to unfulfilled contractual performance obligations and contracts with variable consideration related to undelivered performance obligations is not material.\n-82-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nCost of Products Sold:\nIngenioRx’s cost of products sold includes the cost of prescription drugs dispensed to unaffiliated PBM customers (net of rebates or discounts). This cost includes any co-payments made by or on behalf of the customer. Cost of products sold also includes per-claim administrative fees for prescription fulfillment by its vendor and certain IngenioRx direct costs related to sales and administration of customer contracts.\nShare-Based Compensation:\nOur current compensation philosophy provides for share-based compensation, including stock options, restricted stock awards and an employee stock purchase plan. Stock options are granted for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of the grant. Restricted stock awards are issued at the fair value of the stock on the grant date. The employee stock purchase plan allows for a purchase price per share which is\n90\n% of the fair value of a share of common stock on the lower of the first or last trading day of the plan quarter. The employee stock purchase plan discount is recognized as compensation expense based on GAAP guidance. All other share-based payments to employees are recognized as compensation expense in our consolidated statements of income based on their fair values. Additionally, excess tax benefits, which result from actual tax benefits realized when awards vest or options are exercised exceeding deferred tax benefits previously recognized based on grant date fair value, are recognized as tax benefits in the consolidated statements of income.\nAdvertising and Marketing Costs\n:\nWe use print, broadcast and other advertising to promote our products and to develop our corporate image. We market our products through direct marketing activities and an extensive network of independent agents, brokers and retail partnerships for Individual and Medicare customers, and for certain Group risk-based customers with a smaller employee base. Products for Group risk-based customers with a larger employee base are generally sold through independent brokers or consultants retained by the customer who work with industry specialists from our in-house sales force. In the Individual and Group markets, we offer products through state or federally facilitated marketplaces, or Public Exchanges, and off-exchange products. The cost of advertising and marketing for product promotion is expensed as incurred, while advertising and marketing costs associated with our corporate image are expensed when first aired. Total advertising and marketing expense was $\n588\n, $\n558\nand $\n467\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nHealth Insurance Provider Fee\n:\nThe ACA imposed an annual Health Insurance Provider Fee (“HIP Fee”) on health insurers that wrote certain types of health insurance on U.S. risks, which has been permanently repealed effective January 1, 2021. The HIP Fee was non-deductible for federal income tax purposes. Our affected products were priced to cover the increased selling, general and administrative and income tax expenses associated with the HIP Fee when it was in effect. The HIP Fee was suspended for 2019, resumed and increased to $\n15,523\nfor 2020 and was permanently eliminated beginning in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $\n1,570\nas selling, general and administrative expense related to the HIP Fee. There was no corresponding HIP Fee expense for 2019 or 2021.\nLeases:\nWe lease office space and certain computer and related equipment under noncancelable operating leases. We determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease at its inception. We recognize lease liabilities based on the present value of the minimum lease payments not yet paid by using the lease term, any amounts probable of being owed under any residual value guarantees and the discount rate determined at lease commencement. As our leases do not generally provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental secured borrowing rate commensurate with the underlying lease terms to determine the present value of our lease payments. Our lease liabilities may include amounts for options to extend or terminate a lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. We recognize operating right-of-use (“ROU”) assets at an amount equal to the lease liability adjusted for prepaid or accrued rent, the remaining balance of any lease incentives and unamortized initial direct costs.\nThe operating lease liabilities are reported in other current liabilities and other noncurrent liabilities and the related ROU assets are reported in other noncurrent assets on our consolidated balance sheets. Lease expense for our operating leases is calculated on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is reported in selling, general and administrative expense on our consolidated statements of income. For our office space leases, we account for the lease and non-lease components (such as common area maintenance) as a single lease component. We also do not recognize a lease liability or ROU asset for our office space leases whose lease terms, at commencement, are twelve months or less and that do not include a purchase option or option to extend that we are reasonably certain to exercise.\nWe assess our ROU assets for impairment when there are indicators and compare the carrying amount of the ROU asset to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows. If the estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying\n-83-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\namount of the ROU asset, an impairment calculation is performed. An impairment loss is recorded for the difference of the ROU asset’s carrying value that exceeds its estimated discounted cash flows. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded $\n136\nand $\n258\n, respectively, for impairment and abandonment of ROU assets. See Note 18, “Leases” for additional information about the ROU asset impairment and abandonment charges.\nEarnings per Share:\nEarnings per share amounts, on a basic and diluted basis, have been calculated based upon the weighted-average common shares outstanding for the period.\nBasic earnings per share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share may include the dilutive effect of stock options, restricted stock and convertible debentures, using the treasury stock method. The treasury stock method assumes exercise of stock options and vesting of restricted stock, with the assumed proceeds used to purchase common stock at the average market price for the period. The difference between the number of shares assumed issued and the number of shares assumed purchased represents the dilutive shares.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance:\nIn January 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-01,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848)\n(“ASU 2021-01”). The amendments in ASU 2021-01 provide optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contract modifications and hedging relationships, subject to meeting certain criteria, that reference the London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”) or another reference rate expected to be discontinued because of the reference rate reform. The provisions must be applied at a Topic, Subtopic, or Industry Subtopic level for all transactions other than derivatives, which may be applied at a hedging relationship level. We adopted ASU 2021-01 on January 7, 2021, and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-08,\nCodification Improvements to Subtopic 310-20, Receivables—Nonrefundable Fees and Other Costs\n(“ASU 2020-08”). The amendments in ASU 2020-08 clarify when an entity should assess whether a callable debt security is within the scope of accounting guidance, which impacts the amortization period for nonrefundable fees and other costs. ASU 2020-08 became effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The amendments are to be applied on a prospective basis as of the beginning of the period of adoption for existing or newly purchased callable debt securities. We adopted ASU 2020-08 on January 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-06,\nDebt—Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging—Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40): Accounting for Convertible Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity\n(“ASU 2020-06”)\n.\nThe amendments eliminate two of the three accounting models that require separate accounting for convertible features of debt securities, simplify the contract settlement assessment for equity classification, require the use of the if-converted method for all convertible instruments in the diluted earnings per share calculation and expand disclosure requirements. The amendments are effective for our annual and interim reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2021. We adopted ASU 2020-06 on January 1, 2022 and are using the modified retrospective transition method which resulted in an increase to our reported debt outstanding and a corresponding cumulative-effect reduction to opening retained earnings; the amounts are not material to our overall consolidated financial position. The adoption of ASU 2020-06 did not have an impact on our results of operations or our consolidated cash flows. Use of the if-converted method is not expected to have a material impact on our overall earnings per share calculation.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2019-12,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\n(“ASU 2019-12”). The amendments in ASU 2019-12 remove certain exceptions to the general principles in Accounting Standards Codification Topic 740. The amendments also clarify and amend existing guidance to improve consistent application. The amendments became effective for our annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020. The transition method (retrospective, modified retrospective, or prospective basis) related to the amendments depends on the applicable guidance, and all amendments for which there is no transition guidance specified are to be applied on a prospective basis. We adopted ASU 2019-12 on January 1, 2021, and the adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-13,\nFinancial Instruments—Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of Credit Losses on Financial Instruments\n(“ASU 2016-13”). ASU 2016-13 introduces a current\n-84-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nexpected credit loss model for measuring expected credit losses for certain types of financial instruments held at the reporting date based on historical experience, current conditions and reasonable supportable forecasts. ASU 2016-13 replaces the incurred loss model for measuring expected credit losses, requires expected losses on available-for-sale debt securities to be recognized through an allowance for credit losses rather than as reductions in the amortized cost of the securities and provides for additional disclosure requirements. ASU 2016-13 requires a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings on the balance sheet at the date of adoption and a prospective transition approach for debt securities for which an other-than-temporary impairment had been recognized before the adoption date. The effect of a prospective transition approach is to maintain the same amortized cost basis before and after the date of adoption. We adopted ASU 2016-13 on January 1, 2020, and recognized a cumulative-effect adjustment of $\n35\nto our opening retained earnings for credit related allowances on receivables. The adoption did not have an impact on our consolidated statements of income or cash flows.\nRecent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted:\nIn November 2020, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2020-11,\nFinancial Services—Insurance (Topic 944): Effective Date and Early Application\n(“ASU 2020-11”). The amendments in ASU 2020-11 make changes to the effective date and early application of Accounting Standards Update No. 2018-12,\nFinancial Services—Insurance (Topic 944): Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts\n(“ASU 2018-12”) which was issued in November 2018. The amendments in ASU 2020-11 have extended the original effective date by one year and now the amendments are required for our interim and annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022. The amendments in ASU 2018-12 make changes to a variety of areas to simplify or improve the existing recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure requirements for long-duration contracts issued by an insurance entity. The amendments require insurers to annually review the assumptions they make about their policyholders and update the liabilities for future policy benefits if the assumptions change. The amendments also simplify the amortization of deferred contract acquisition costs and add new disclosure requirements about the assumptions insurers use to measure their liabilities and how they may affect future cash flows. The amendments related to the liability for future policy benefits for traditional and limited-payment contracts and deferred acquisition costs are to be applied to contracts in force as of the beginning of the earliest period presented, with an option to apply such amendments retrospectively with a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the earliest period presented. The amendments for market risk benefits are to be applied retrospectively. We are currently evaluating the effects the adoption of ASU 2020-11 and ASU 2018-12 will have on our consolidated financial position, results of operations, cash flows, and related disclosures.\nThere were no other new accounting pronouncements that were issued or became effective during the year ended December 31, 2021 that had, or are expected to have, a material impact on our financial position, results of operations, cash flows or financial statement disclosures.\n3.\nBusiness Acquisitions\nCompleted Acquisitions\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company completed business combinations for total cash consideration of approximately $\n4,021\n. These acquisitions included myNEXUS, Inc. (“myNEXUS”), a comprehensive home-based nursing management company for payors, and MMM Holdings, LLC (“MMM”), including its Medicare Advantage plan, Medicaid plan, and other affiliated companies. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's final estimates of their fair values, of which $\n1,577\nhas been allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, $\n20\nto indefinite-lived intangible assets, and $\n2,521\nto goodwill. The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company completed business combinations for total cash consideration of approximately $\n2,488\n. These acquisitions included Beacon Health Options, Inc. (“Beacon”) a behavioral health managed care organization. The purchase price was allocated to the tangible and intangible net assets acquired based on management's final estimates of their fair values, of which $\n868\nwas allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, $\n225\nto indefinite-lived intangible assets, and $\n1,231\nto goodwill. The majority of goodwill is not deductible for income tax purposes.\n-85-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAcquired tangible assets (liabilities) at the acquisition date were:\nThe preliminary purchase price allocations for the various business combinations are subject to adjustment as valuation analyses, primarily related to intangible assets and contingent and tax liabilities, are finalized.\nAcquisition date fair values and weighted-average useful lives assigned to intangible assets include:\nThe results of operations and financial condition of acquired entities have been included in our consolidated results and the results of the corresponding operating segment as of the date of acquisition. Through December 31, 2021, the impact of the acquired entities on revenue and net earnings was not material. Unaudited pro forma revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as if the acquisitions had occurred on January 1, 2020 were immaterial for both periods. The pro forma effects of the acquisitions on net earnings were immaterial for both years.\nPending Acquisition\nOn November 10, 2021, we announced our entrance into an agreement with Personal Touch Holding Corporation to acquire Integra Managed Care (“Integra”). Integra is a managed long-term care plan that serves New York state Medicaid members, enabling adults with long-term care needs and disabilities to live safely and independently in their own home. The acquisition is expected to close by the end of the second quarter of 2022 and is subject to standard closing conditions and customary approvals.\n4.\nBusiness Optimization Initiatives\nWe believe that our properties are adequate and suitable for our business as presently conducted; however, we are continuing to evaluate our real estate strategy as it relates to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and the changing needs of a more hybrid remote and in-office workforce. As a result, during 2021, we identified additional reductions of office space and recorded a charge of $\n202\nin selling, general and administrative expenses. This charge includes $\n136\nfor impairment and abandonment of operating-lease related ROU assets and $\n66\nfor impairment and abandonment of property and equipment. The charges recognized in the Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other segments in 2021, were $\n108\n, $\n60\n, $\n1\nand $\n33\n, respectively. See also Note 20, “Segment Information.”\n-86-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nDuring 2020, our management introduced enterprise-wide initiatives to optimize our business and, as a result, we recorded a charge of $\n653\nin selling, general and administrative expenses. This charge included $\n258\nfor impairment and abandonment of operating-lease related ROU assets, $\n198\nfor impairment and abandonment of property and equipment and $\n197\nfor future payments for employee termination costs in connection with the repositioning and reskilling of our workforce. The charges recognized in the Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other segments in 2020, were $\n311\n, $\n205\n, $\n4\nand $\n133\n, respectively. See also Note 20, “Segment Information.” We believe these initiatives largely represent our progression towards becoming a more agile organization, including process automation and a reduction in our office space footprint.\nA summary of the activity of the 2020 employee termination costs for the year ended December 31, 2021 and ending balance at December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nWe expect the employee termination costs to be paid by the end of 2022.\n-87-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n5.\nInvestments\nA summary of current and long-term fixed maturity securities, available-for-sale, at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-88-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFor fixed maturity securities in an unrealized loss position at December 31, 2021 and 2020, the following table summarizes the aggregate fair values and gross unrealized losses by length of time those securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position.\nBelow are discussions by security type for unrealized losses and credit losses as of December 31, 2021:\nCorporate securities:\nAn allowance for credit losses on certain retail, travel and entertainment, energy, and basic materials sector fixed maturity corporate securities has been determined based on qualitative and quantitative factors including credit rating, decline in fair value and industry condition along with other available market data. With multiple risk factors present, these securities were reviewed for expected future cash flow to determine the portion of unrealized losses that were credit related and to record an allowance for credit losses. Unrealized losses on our other corporate securities were largely due to market conditions relating to the COVID-19 pandemic; however, qualitative factors did not indicate a credit loss as of December 31, 2021. We do not intend to sell these investments and it is likely we will not have to sell these investments prior to maturity or recovery of amortized cost.\nResidential mortgage-backed securities:\nAn allowance for credit loss was established on certain residential mortgage-backed securities. Notification of maturity and coupon default, as well as a significant and sustained decline in fair value, were factors to indicate a credit loss. No other mortgage securities had material unrealized losses or qualitative factors to indicate a credit loss. We do not intend to sell these investments and it is likely we will not be required to sell these investments prior to maturity or recovery of amortized cost.\n-89-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAs for the remaining securities shown in the table above, unrealized losses on these securities have not been recognized into income because we do not intend to sell these investments and it is likely that we will not be required to sell these investments prior to their anticipated recovery. The decline in fair value is largely due to changes in interest rates and other market conditions. We have evaluated these securities for any change in credit rating and have determined that no allowance is necessary. The fair value is expected to recover as the securities approach maturity.\nThe tables below present a roll-forward by major security type of the allowance for credit losses on fixed maturity securities available-for-sale held at period end for the years ended December 31, 2021, and 2020:\nThe amortized cost and fair value of fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021, by contractual maturity, are shown below. Expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations.\n-90-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nEquity Securities\nA summary of current equity securities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nInvestment Income\nThe major categories of net investment income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nInvestment Gains\nNet investment gains (losses) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n-91-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe gains and losses related to equity securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 are as follows:\nA primary objective in the management of our fixed maturity and equity portfolios is to maximize total return relative to underlying liabilities and respective liquidity needs. In achieving this goal, assets may be sold to take advantage of market conditions or other investment opportunities as well as tax considerations. Sales will generally produce realized gains and losses. In the ordinary course of business, we may sell securities at a loss for a number of reasons, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the investment environment; (ii) expectations that the fair value could deteriorate further; (iii) desire to reduce exposure to an issuer or an industry; (iv) changes in credit quality; or (v) changes in expected cash flow.\nTotal proceeds from sales, maturities, calls or redemptions of fixed maturity securities was $\n10,565\n, $\n11,122\nand $\n8,351\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when a credit loss has occurred. We follow a consistent and systematic process for recognizing impairments on securities that sustain credit declines in value. We have established a committee responsible for the impairment review process. The decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information. The impairment review process considers a number of factors including, but not limited to: (i) the extent to which the fair value is less than book value, (ii) the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer, (iii) our intent and ability to retain impaired investments for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value, (iv) our intent to sell or the likelihood that we will need to sell a fixed maturity security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, (v) whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments, (vi) the reasons for the decline in value (i.e., credit event compared to liquidity, general credit spread widening, currency exchange rate or interest rate factors) and (vii) general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors. For securities that are deemed to be credit impaired, an allowance is created.\nInvestment securities are exposed to various risks, such as interest rate, market and credit. Due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of investment securities, it is possible that changes in these risk factors in the near term could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations or shareholders’ equity.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were no individual investments that exceeded 10% of shareholders’ equity.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, there were\ntwo\nand\nthree\n, respectively, fixed maturity investments that did not produce income during the years then ended.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had committed approximately $\n1,558\nand $\n1,320\n, respectively, to future capital calls from various third-party investments in exchange for an ownership interest in the related entities.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, securities with carrying values of approximately $\n632\nand $\n562\n, respectively, were deposited by our insurance subsidiaries under requirements of regulatory authorities.\nAccrued Investment Income\nAccrued investment income totaled $\n205\nand $\n188\n, at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognize accrued investment income under the caption “Other receivables” on our consolidated balance sheets.\nSecurities Lending Programs\nThe fair value of the collateral received at the time of the securities lending transactions amounted to $\n2,155\nand $\n1,199\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The value of the collateral represented\n102\n% of the market value of the securities on loan at each of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n-92-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nWe recognize the collateral as an asset under the caption “Other current assets” in our consolidated balance sheets, and we recognize a corresponding liability for the obligation to return the collateral to the borrower under the caption “Other current liabilities.” The securities on loan are reported in the applicable investment category on our consolidated balance sheets.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the remaining contractual maturities of our securities lending transactions included overnight and continuous transactions of cash for $\n1,874\nand $\n1,056\n, respectively, and United States Government securities for $\n281\nand $\n143\n, respectively.\n-93-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n6.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe primarily invest in the following types of derivative financial instruments: interest rate swaps, futures, forward contracts, put and call options, collars, swaptions, embedded derivatives and warrants. We also enter into master netting agreements which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had received collateral of $\n18\nand $\n37\n, respectively, related to our derivative financial instruments.\nA summary of the aggregate contractual or notional amounts and estimated fair values related to derivative financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-94-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFair Value Hedges\nWe have entered into various interest rate swap contracts to convert a portion of our interest rate exposure on our long-term debt from fixed rates to floating rates. The floating rates payable on all of our fair value hedges are benchmarked to the LIBOR.\nA summary of our outstanding fair value hedges at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nThe following amounts were recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe have entered into a series of forward starting pay fixed interest rate swaps with the objective of eliminating the variability of cash flows in the interest payments on future financings that were anticipated at the time of entering into the swaps. During 2021 and 2020, swaps in the notional amount of $\n450\nand $\n725\n, respectively, were terminated.\nThe unrecognized loss for all expired and terminated cash flow hedges included in accumulated other comprehensive loss, net of tax, was $\n239\nand $\n250\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the total amount of amortization over the next twelve months for all cash flow hedges is estimated to increase interest expense by approximately $\n13\n. No amounts were excluded from effectiveness testing.\n-95-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nNon-Hedging Derivatives\nA summary of the effect of non-hedging derivatives on our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n7.\nFair Value\nAssets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value. Level inputs, as defined by FASB guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures, are as follows:\nThe following methods, assumptions and inputs were used to determine the fair value of each class of the following assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets:\nCash equivalents:\nCash equivalents primarily consist of highly rated money market funds with maturities of three months or less, and are purchased daily at par value with specified yield rates. Due to the high ratings and short-term nature of the funds, we designate all cash equivalents as Level I.\nFixed maturity securities, available-for-sale:\nFair values of available-for-sale fixed maturity securities are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value to facilitate fair value measurements and disclosures. Level II securities primarily include corporate securities, securities from states, municipalities and political subdivisions, mortgage-backed securities, United States Government securities, foreign government securities, and certain other asset-backed securities. For securities not actively traded, the pricing services may use quoted market prices of comparable instruments or discounted cash flow analyses, incorporating inputs that are currently observable in the markets\n-96-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nfor similar securities. We have controls in place to review the pricing services’ qualifications and procedures used to determine fair values. In addition, we periodically review the pricing services’ pricing methodologies, data sources and pricing inputs to ensure the fair values obtained are reasonable. Inputs that are often used in the valuation methodologies include, but are not limited to, broker quotes, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds. We also have certain fixed maturity securities, primarily corporate debt securities, that are designated Level III securities. For these securities, the valuation methodologies may incorporate broker quotes or discounted cash flow analyses using assumptions for inputs such as expected cash flows, benchmark yields, credit spreads, default rates and prepayment speeds that are not observable in the markets.\nEquity securities:\nFair values of equity securities are generally designated as Level I and are based on quoted market prices. For certain equity securities, quoted market prices for the identical security are not always available, and the fair value is estimated by reference to similar securities for which quoted prices are available. These securities are designated Level II. We also have certain equity securities, including private equity securities, for which the fair value is estimated based on each security’s current condition and future cash flow projections. Such securities are designated Level III. The fair values of these private equity securities are generally based on either broker quotes or discounted cash flow projections using assumptions for inputs such as the weighted-average cost of capital, long-term revenue growth rates and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, and/or revenue multiples that are not observable in the markets.\nSecurities lending collateral:\nFair values of securities lending collateral are based on quoted market prices, where available. These fair values are obtained primarily from third-party pricing services, which generally use Level I or Level II inputs for the determination of fair value, to facilitate fair value measurements and disclosures.\nDerivatives:\nFair values are based on the quoted market prices by the financial institution that is the counterparty to the derivative transaction. We independently verify prices provided by the counterparties using valuation models that incorporate market observable inputs for similar derivative transactions. Derivatives are designated as Level II securities. Derivatives presented within the fair value hierarchy table below are presented on a gross basis and not on a master netting basis by counterparty.\nIn addition, the following methods and assumptions were used to determine the fair value of each class of pension benefit plan assets and other benefit plan assets not defined above (see Note 11, “Retirement Benefits,” for fair values of benefit plan assets):\nMutual funds\n: Fair values are based on quoted market prices, which represent the net asset value (“NAV”) of the shares held.\nPartnership investments\n: Fair values are estimated based on the plan’s proportionate share of the undistributed partners’ capital as reported in audited financial statements of the partnership. In accordance with FASB guidance, certain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share as a practical expedient or the fair value measurement alternative have been classified in the fair value hierarchy. The fair value amounts presented are intended to permit reconciliation of the fair value hierarchy to the total investments of the master trust.\nCommingled fund\n: Fair value is based on NAV per fund share, primarily derived from the quoted prices in active markets on the underlying equity securities.\nContract with insurance company\n: Fair value of the contract in the insurance company general investment account is determined by the insurance company based on the fair value of the underlying investments of the account.\nInvestment in DOL 103-12 trust:\nFair value is based on the plan’s proportionate share of the fair value of investments held by the trust, qualified as a Department of Labor Regulation 2520.103-12 entity (“DOL 103-12 trust”) as reported in the audited financial statements of the trust, where the trustee applies fair value measurements to the underlying investments of the trust.\nLife insurance contracts:\nFair value is based on the cash surrender value of the policies as reported by the insurer.\n-97-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nA summary of fair value measurements by level for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-98-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of assets measured at fair value on a recurring basis using Level III inputs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThere were no individually material transfers into or out of Level III during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nCertain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis; that is, the instruments are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments only in certain circumstances. As disclosed in Note 3, “Business Acquisitions,” we completed our acquisitions of myNEXUS and MMM during the second quarter of 2021, as well as our acquisition of Beacon during the first quarter of 2020. The net assets acquired in our acquisitions of myNEXUS,\n-99-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nMMM and Beacon and resulting goodwill and other intangible assets were recorded at fair value primarily using Level III inputs. The majority of assets acquired and liabilities assumed were recorded at their carrying values as of the respective date of acquisition, as their carrying values approximated their fair values due to their short-term nature. The fair values of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in our acquisitions of myNEXUS, MMM and Beacon were internally estimated based on the income approach. The income approach estimates fair value based on the present value of the cash flows that the assets could be expected to generate in the future. We developed internal estimates for the expected cash flows and discount rate in the present value calculation. Other than the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in our acquisitions of myNEXUS, MMM and Beacon described above, there were no material assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nOur valuation policy is determined by members of our treasury and accounting departments. Whenever possible, our policy is to obtain quoted market prices in active markets to estimate fair values for recognition and disclosure purposes. Where quoted market prices in active markets are not available, fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow analyses, broker quotes, unobservable inputs or other valuation techniques. These techniques are significantly affected by our assumptions, including discount rates and estimates of future cash flows. The use of assumptions for unobservable inputs for the determination of fair value involves a level of judgment and uncertainty. Changes in assumptions that reasonably could have been different at the reporting date may result in a higher or lower determination of fair value. Changes in fair value measurements, if significant, may affect performance of cash flows.\nPotential taxes and other transaction costs are not considered in estimating fair values. Our valuation policy is generally to obtain quoted prices for each security from third-party pricing services, which are derived through recently reported trades for identical or similar securities making adjustments through the reporting date based upon available market observable information. As we are responsible for the determination of fair value, we perform analysis on the prices received from the pricing services to determine whether the prices are reasonable estimates of fair value. This analysis is performed by our internal treasury personnel who are familiar with our investment portfolios, the pricing services engaged and the valuation techniques and inputs used. Our analysis includes procedures such as a review of month-to-month price fluctuations and price comparisons to secondary pricing services. There were no adjustments to quoted market prices obtained from the pricing services during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nIn addition to the preceding disclosures on assets recorded at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets, FASB guidance also requires the disclosure of fair values for certain other financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value, whether or not such values are recognized in the consolidated balance sheets.\nNon-financial instruments such as real estate, property and equipment, other current assets, deferred income taxes, intangible assets and certain financial instruments, such as policy liabilities, are excluded from the fair value disclosures. Therefore, the fair value amounts cannot be aggregated to determine our underlying economic value.\nThe carrying amounts reported in the consolidated balance sheets for cash, premium receivables, self-funded receivables, other receivables, unearned income, accounts payable and accrued expenses, and certain other current liabilities approximate fair value because of the short-term nature of these items. These assets and liabilities are not listed in the table below.\nThe following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each class of financial instrument that is recorded at its carrying value on the consolidated balance sheets:\nOther invested assets\n: Other invested assets primarily include our investments in limited partnerships, joint ventures and other non-controlled corporations and mortgage loans, as well as the cash surrender value of corporate-owned life insurance policies. Investments in limited partnerships, joint ventures and other non-controlled corporations are carried at our share in the entities’ undistributed earnings, which approximates fair value. Mortgage loans are carried at amortized cost, which approximates fair value. The carrying value of corporate-owned life insurance policies represents the cash surrender value as reported by the respective insurer, which approximates fair value.\nShort-term borrowings\n: The fair value of our short-term borrowings is based on quoted market prices for the same or similar debt, or if no quoted market prices were available, on the current market interest rates estimated to be available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities.\n-100-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLong-term debt—commercial paper\n: The carrying amount for commercial paper approximates fair value, as the underlying instruments have variable interest rates at market value.\nLong-term debt—senior unsecured notes and surplus notes\n: The fair values of our notes are based on quoted market prices in active markets for the same or similar debt, or, if no quoted market prices are available, on the current market observable rates estimated to be available to us for debt of similar terms and remaining maturities.\nLong-term debt—convertible debentures\n: The fair value of our convertible debentures is based on the quoted market price in the active private market in which the convertible debentures trade.\nA summary of the estimated fair values by level of each class of financial instrument that is recorded at its carrying value on our consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-101-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n8.\nIncome Taxes\nThe components of deferred income taxes at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nDeferred tax liabilities, net totaled $\n2,702\nand $\n2,019\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively in our consolidated balance sheet. We recognized $\n103\nand $\n0\nof deferred tax asset under the caption “Other noncurrent assets” at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognized $\n2,805\nand $\n2,019\nof deferred tax liability under the caption “Deferred tax liabilities, net” at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAs of December 31, 2021, and as a result of acquisitions during the year, we established U.S. deferred taxes for undistributed earnings from certain non-U.S. subsidiaries, which are included in the Investment basis component above. As of December 31, 2020, our undistributed earnings from all non-U.S. subsidiaries were intended to be indefinitely reinvested in non-U.S. operations, and therefore no U.S. deferred taxes were recorded.\n-102-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nSignificant components of the provision for income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 consist of the following:\nState and local current tax expense is reported gross of federal benefit in the preceding table, and includes amounts related to audit settlements, uncertain tax positions, state tax credits and true up of prior years’ tax. Such items are included on a net of federal tax basis in multiple lines in the following rate reconciliation table.\nA reconciliation of income tax expense recorded in the consolidated statements of income and amounts computed at the statutory federal income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized income tax expense of $\n1,830\n, or $\n7.41\nper diluted share. The HIP Fee payment was eliminated beginning in 2021.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized income tax expense of $\n1,666\n, or $\n6.55\nper diluted share, which included income tax expense of $\n330\n, or $\n1.30\nper diluted share as a result of the non-tax deductibility of the HIP Fee payment, which was reinstated for 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2019, we recognized income tax expense of $\n1,178\n, or $\n4.53\nper diluted share. The HIP Fee payment was suspended for 2019.\nThe change in the carrying amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-103-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe table above excludes interest, net of related tax benefits, which is treated as income tax expense (benefit) under our accounting policy. The interest is included in the amounts described in the following paragraph.\nThe amount of unrecognized tax benefits that would impact our effective tax rate in future periods, if recognized, was $\n250\nand $\n227\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Also included in the table above, at December 31, 2021, is $\n2\nthat would be recognized as an adjustment to additional paid-in capital, which would not affect our effective tax rate. In addition to the contingent liabilities included in the table above, we filed protective state income tax refund claims of approximately $\n310\nduring 2017. There were no equivalent protective state income tax refund claims filed in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a net interest expense of $\n9\n. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we recognized a net interest expense (benefit) of $\n7\nand ($\n11\n), respectively. We had accrued approximately $\n42\nand $\n33\nfor the payment of interest at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, as further described below, certain tax years remain open to examination by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and various state and local authorities. As a result of these examinations and discussions with taxing agencies, we have recorded amounts for uncertain tax positions. It is anticipated that the amount of unrecognized tax benefits will change in the next twelve months due to possible settlements of audits and changes in temporary items. However, the ultimate resolution of these items is dependent on the completion of negotiations with various taxing authorities. While it is difficult to determine when other tax settlements will actually occur, it is reasonably possible that one could occur in the next twelve months and our unrecognized tax benefits could change within a range of approximately ($\n14\n) to ($\n105\n).\nWe are a member of the IRS Compliance Assurance Process (“CAP”). The objective of CAP is to reduce taxpayer burden and uncertainty while assuring the IRS of the accuracy of tax returns prior to filing, thereby reducing or eliminating the need for post-filing examinations.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the IRS examination of our 2021 tax year continues to be in process.\nIn certain states, we pay premium taxes in lieu of state income taxes. Premium taxes are reported in selling, general and administrative expense.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of $\n181\nthat will expire beginning 2032 through 2041 and $\n153\nthat have an indefinite carryforward period; state net operating loss carryforwards expire beginning 2022 through 2041, with some having an indefinite carryforward period.\nIncome taxes receivable totaled $\n173\nand $\n262\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We recognize the income tax receivable as an asset under the caption “Other current assets” in our consolidated balance sheets.\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, federal income taxes paid totaled $\n1,299\n, $\n1,790\nand $\n1,403\n, respectively.\n9.\nProperty and Equipment\nA summary of property and equipment at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-104-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nDepreciation expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n136\n, $\n176\nand $\n147\n, respectively. Amortization expense on computer software and leasehold improvements for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n532\n, $\n462\nand $\n528\n, respectively, which includes amortization expense on computer software, both purchased and internally developed, for 2021, 2020 and 2019 of $\n485\n, $\n412\nand $\n450\n, respectively. Capitalized costs related to the internal development of software of $\n5,626\nand $\n4,783\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, are reported with computer software.\nImpairment of property and equipment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n73\nand $\n198\n, respectively, which is included in selling, general and administrative expenses. Included in these amounts was impairment of property and equipment related to our activities as disclosed in Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives.” For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recorded impairment charges for property and equipment related to these initiatives of $\n66\nand $\n198\n, respectively.\n10.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nA summary of the change in the carrying amount of goodwill for our segments (see Note 20, “Segment Information”) for 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nAs required by FASB guidance, we completed annual impairment tests of existing goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives during 2021, 2020 and 2019. We perform these annual impairment tests during the fourth quarter. FASB guidance also requires interim impairment testing to be performed when potential impairment indicators exist. These tests involve the use of estimates related to the fair value of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives and require a significant degree of management judgment and the use of subjective assumptions. Qualitative testing procedures include assessing our financial performance, macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, various asset specific factors and entity specific events. For quantitative testing, the fair values are estimated using the projected income and market valuation approaches, incorporating Level III internal estimates for inputs, including, but not limited to, revenue projections, income projections, cash flows and discount rates.\nWe did not incur any impairment losses in 2021, 2020 or 2019, as the estimated fair values of our reporting units were substantially in excess of their carrying values.\n-105-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe components of other intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nIntangible assets, along with the related accumulated amortization, are removed from the table above at the end of the fiscal year in which they become fully amortized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the estimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years is as follows: 2022, $\n483\n; 2023, $\n429\n; 2024, $\n369\n; 2025, $\n317\n; and 2026, $\n264\n.\n11.\nRetirement Benefits\nWe sponsor various non-contributory employee defined benefit plans through certain subsidiaries.\nThe Anthem Cash Balance Plan A and the Anthem Cash Balance Plan B are cash balance pension plans covering certain eligible employees of the affiliated companies that participate in these plans. Effective January 1, 2006, benefits were curtailed, with the result that most participants stopped accruing benefits but continue to earn interest on benefits accrued prior to the curtailment. Certain participants subject to collective bargaining and certain other participants who met grandfathering rules continued to accrue benefits. Participants who did not receive credits and/or benefit accruals were included in the Anthem Cash Balance Plan A, while employees who were still receiving credits and/or benefits participated in the Anthem Cash Balance Plan B. Effective January 1, 2019, benefits under the Anthem Cash Balance Plan B were curtailed. All grandfathered participants no longer have pay credits added to their accounts but continue to earn interest on existing account balances. Participants continue to earn years of pension service for vesting purposes. Several pension plans acquired through various corporate mergers and acquisitions were merged into these plans in prior years.\nThe Employees’ Retirement Plan of Blue Cross of California (the “BCC Plan”) is a defined benefit pension plan that covers eligible employees of Blue Cross of California who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement. Effective January 1, 2007, benefits were curtailed under the BCC Plan with the result that no Blue Cross of California employees hired or rehired after December 31, 2006 are eligible to participate in the BCC Plan.\nAll of the plans’ assets consist primarily of equity securities, fixed maturity securities, investment funds and cash. The funding policies for all plans are to contribute amounts at least sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirements set forth in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended (“ERISA”), as further amended by the Pension Protection Act of 2006, and in accordance with income tax regulations, plus such additional amounts as are necessary to provide assets sufficient to meet the benefits to be paid to plan participants.\nThe following tables disclose consolidated “pension benefits,” which include the defined benefit pension plans described above, and consolidated “other benefits,” which include postretirement health and welfare benefits including medical, vision and dental benefits offered to certain employees. Calculations were computed using assumptions at the December 31 measurement dates.\n-106-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe reconciliation of the benefit obligation is as follows:\nThe changes in the fair value of plan assets are as follows:\nThe net amount included in the consolidated balance sheets is as follows:\nThe net amounts included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) that have not been recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs are as follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for the defined benefit pension plans was $\n1,857\nand $\n2,007\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, certain pension plans had accumulated benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Such plans had accumulated benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of $\n56\nand $\n0\n, respectively. In addition, certain plans had\n-107-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nprojected benefit obligations in excess of plan assets. Such plans had projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets of $\n107\nand $\n49\n, respectively.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in calculating the benefit obligations for all plans are as follows:\nThe components of net periodic benefit credit included in the consolidated statements of income are as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we incurred total settlement losses of $\n26\n, $\n29\nand $\n9\n, respectively, as lump-sum payments exceeded the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for certain of our plans.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in calculating the net periodic benefit cost for all plans are as follows:\n-108-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of pre-Medicare (those who are not currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2021 measurement date was\n7.00\n% for 2022, with a gradual decline to\n4.50\n% by the year\n2033\n. The assumed healthcare cost trend rates used to measure the expected cost of post-Medicare (those who are currently eligible for Medicare benefits) other benefits at our December 31, 2021 measurement date was\n5.50\n% for 2022, with a gradual decline to\n4.50\n% by the year\n2033\n. These estimated trend rates are subject to change in the future.\nPlan assets include a diversified mix of equity securities, investment grade fixed maturity securities and other types of investments across a range of sectors and levels of capitalization to maximize long-term return for a prudent level of risk. The weighted-average target allocation for pension benefit plan assets is\n44\n% equity securities,\n48\n% fixed maturity securities, and\n8\n% to all other types of investments. Equity securities primarily include a mix of domestic securities, foreign securities and mutual funds invested in equities. Fixed maturity securities primarily include treasury securities, corporate bonds and asset-backed investments issued by corporations and the U.S. government. Other types of investments primarily include insurance contracts designed specifically for employee benefit plans and a commingled fund comprised primarily of equity securities. As of December 31, 2021, there were no significant concentrations of investments in the pension benefit assets or other benefit assets. No plan assets were invested in Anthem common stock.\nThe partnerships hold various types of underlying assets such as real estate and investments in oil and gas companies. Generally, the partnership interests are not redeemable and are transferable only with the consent of the general partner. Unfunded commitments related to all partnership interests totaled approximately $\n3\nat each of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nPension benefit assets and other benefit assets recorded at fair value are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with the inputs used to measure their fair value.\n-109-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe fair values of our pension benefit assets and other benefit assets by asset category and level inputs at December 31, 2021, excluding cash, investment income receivable and amounts due to/from brokers, resulting in a net asset of $\n48\n, and excluding estimated claims settlements to be paid from other benefit assets of ($\n29\n), are as follows (see Note 7, “Fair Value,” for additional information regarding the definition of level inputs):\n-110-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe fair values of our pension benefit assets and other benefit assets by asset category and level inputs at December 31, 2020, excluding cash, investment income receivable and amounts due to/from brokers, resulting in a net asset of $\n64\n, are as follows:\n-111-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of plan assets measured at fair value using Level III inputs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThere were no other transfers into or out of Level III during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nOur current funding strategy is to fund an amount at least equal to the minimum required funding as determined under ERISA with consideration of maximum tax deductible amounts. We may elect to make discretionary contributions up to the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no material contributions were necessary to meet ERISA required funding levels. However, during each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we made tax deductible discretionary contributions to the pension benefit plans of $\n7\n, $\n7\n, and $\n4\n, respectively.

Liabilities at any period-end are continually reviewed and re-estimated as information regarding actual claims payments, or runout, becomes known. This information is compared to the originally\nestablished year end liability. Negative amounts reported for incurred medical claims related to prior years result from claims being settled for amounts less than originally estimated. The prior year redundancy of $\n1,703\nshown above for the year ended December 31, 2021 represents an estimate\n-114-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nbased on paid claim activity from January 1, 2021 to December 31, 2021. Medical claim liabilities are usually described as having a “short tail,” which means that they are generally paid within twelve months of the member receiving service from the provider. Accordingly, the majority of the $\n1,703\nredundancy relates to claims incurred in calendar year 2020.\nThe following table provides a summary of the two key assumptions having the most significant impact on our incurred but not paid liability estimates for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, which are the completion and trend factors. These two key assumptions can be influenced by utilization levels, unit costs, mix of business, benefit plan designs, provider reimbursement levels, processing system conversions and changes, claim inventory levels, claim processing patterns, claim submission patterns and operational changes resulting from business combinations. The impact from COVID-19 on healthcare utilization and medical claims submission patterns has increased estimation uncertainty on our incurred but not reported liability at December 31, 2021. Slowdowns in claims submission patterns and increases in utilization levels for COVID-19 testing and treatment during the fourth quarter of 2021 are the primary factors that lead to the increased estimation uncertainty.\nThe favorable development recognized in 2021 resulted primarily from trend factors in late 2020 developing more favorably than originally expected as well as a smaller but significant contribution from completion factor development.\nThe favorable development recognized in 2020 resulted primarily from trend factors in late 2019 developing more favorably than originally expected as well as a smaller contribution from completion factor development.\nThe favorable development recognized in 2019 resulted from trend and completion factors developing more favorably than originally expected as well as a smaller but significant contribution from completion factor development.\nThe reconciliation of net incurred medical claims to benefit expense included in the consolidated statements of income is as follows:\n-115-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nIncurred claims development, net of reinsurance, for the Commercial & Specialty Business for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nPaid claims development, net of reinsurance, for the Commercial & Specialty Business for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, the total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims for the Commercial & Specialty Business was $\n33\n, $\n171\nand $\n3,630\nfor the claim years 2019 and prior, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021, the cumulative number of reported claims for the Commercial & Specialty Business was\n91\n,\n80\nand\n80\nfor the claim years 2019 and prior, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nIncurred claims development, net of reinsurance, for the Government Business as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n-116-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nPaid claims development, net of reinsurance, for the Government Business as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, the total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims for the Government Business was $\n90\n, $\n247\nand $\n8,812\nfor the claim years 2019 and prior, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021, the cumulative number of reported claims for the Government Business was\n253\n,\n263\nand\n300\nfor the claim years 2019 and prior, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nIncurred claims development, net of reinsurance, for Other as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nPaid claims development, net of reinsurance, for Other as of and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, the total of incurred but not reported liabilities plus expected development on reported claims for Other was $\n0\n, $\n16\nand $\n262\nfor the claim years 2019 and prior, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nAt December 31, 2021, the cumulative number of reported claims for Other was\n0\n,\n28\n, and\n25\nfor the claim years 2019 and prior, 2020 and 2021, respectively.\nThe information about incurred claims development, paid claims development and cumulative number of reported claims for the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2020 for our Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business and Other, is unaudited and presented as supplementary information.\nThe cumulative number of reported claims for each claim year for our Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business and Other have been developed using historical data captured by our claim payment systems.

As a member we have the ability to obtain short-term cash advances, subject to certain minimum collateral requirements. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, $\n275\nand $\n0\n, respectively, were outstanding under our short-term FHLB borrowings. Outstanding short-term FHLB borrowings at December 31, 2021 had fixed interest rates of\n0.180\n%.\nThrough certain subsidiaries, we have entered into multiple 364-day lines of credit (the “Subsidiary Credit Facilities”) with separate lenders for general corporate purposes. The Subsidiary Credit Facilities provide combined credit of up to $\n200\n. The interest rate on each line of credit is based on the LIBOR rate plus a predetermined rate. Our ability to borrow under the lines of credit is subject to compliance with certain covenants. At each of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $\n0\nwas outstanding under our Subsidiary Credit Facilities.\n-118-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nLong-term Debt\nThe carrying value of long-term debt at December 31, 2021 and 2020 consists of the following:\n-119-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nAll debt is a direct obligation of Anthem, Inc., except for the surplus note, the FHLB borrowings and the Subsidiary Credit Facilities.\nWe generally issue senior unsecured notes (“Notes”) for long-term borrowing purposes. Certain of these Notes may have a call feature that allows us to redeem the Notes at any time at our option and/or a put feature that allows a Note holder to redeem the Notes upon the occurrence of both a change in control event and a downgrade of the Notes below an investment grade rating.\nOn May 15, 2021, we redeemed the $\n700\noutstanding principal balance of our\n3.700\n% Notes due August 15, 2021\nat a redemption price equal to 100% of the aggregate principal amount of the notes being redeemed, plus accrued and unpaid interest.\nOn March 17, 2021, we issued $\n500\naggregate principal amount of\n0.450\n% Notes due 2023 (the “2023 Notes”), $\n750\naggregate principal amount of\n1.500\n% Notes due 2026 (the “2026 Notes”), $\n1,000\naggregate principal amount of\n2.550\n% Notes due 2031 (the “2031 Notes”) and $\n1,250\naggregate principal amount of\n3.600\n% Notes due 2051 (the “2051 Notes”) under our shelf registration statement. Interest on the 2023 Notes, 2026 Notes, 2031 Notes and 2051 Notes is payable semiannually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 of each year, commencing September 15, 2021. We used the net proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the funding of acquisitions, repayment of short-term and long-term debt and the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased $\n52\nof outstanding principal amount of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $\n67\n. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n15\nfor the repurchase of these notes.\nOn November 23, 2020, we repaid, at maturity, the $\n900\noutstanding balance of our\n2.500\n% senior unsecured notes. On August 17, 2020, we repaid, at maturity, the $\n700\noutstanding balance of our\n4.350\n% senior unsecured notes.\nAdditionally, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we repurchased $\n79\nof outstanding principal amount of certain other senior unsecured notes, plus applicable premium for early redemption plus accrued and unpaid interest, for cash totaling $\n109\n. We recognized a loss on extinguishment of debt of $\n30\nfor the repurchase of these notes.\nOn May 5, 2020, we issued $\n400\naggregate principal amount of additional senior notes pursuant to a reopening of our existing\n2.375\n% Notes due 2025 (the “2025 Notes”), $\n1,100\naggregate principal amount of\n2.250\n% Notes due 2030 (the “2030 Notes”), and $\n1,000\naggregate principal amount of\n3.125\n% Notes due 2050 (the “2050 Notes”) under our shelf registration statement. The 2025 Notes constitute an additional issuance of our\n2.375\n% notes due 2025, of which $\n850\naggregate principal amount was issued on September 9, 2019\n.\nInterest on the 2025 Notes is deemed to have accrued from January 15, 2020 and is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing July 15, 2020. Interest on the 2030 Notes and 2050 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and November 15 of each year, commencing November 15, 2020. The proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, repayment of short-term and long-term debt, repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program and to fund acquisitions.\nOn September 9, 2019, we issued $\n850\naggregate principal amount of the 2025 Notes, $\n825\naggregate principal amount of\n2.875\n% Notes due 2029 (the “2029 Notes”), and $\n825\naggregate principal amount of\n3.700\n% Notes due 2049 (the “2049 Notes”) under our shelf registration statement. Interest on the 2025 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on January 15 and July 15 of each year, commencing January 15, 2020. Interest on the 2029 Notes and the 2049 Notes is payable semi-annually in arrears on March 15 and September 15 each year, commencing March 15, 2020. The proceeds were used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including, but not limited to, the repurchase of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program, repayment of short-term and long-term debt and to fund acquisitions.\nOn August 15, 2019, we repaid, at maturity, the $\n850\noutstanding balance of our\n2.250\n% senior unsecured notes.\n-120-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe surplus note is an unsecured obligation of Anthem Insurance Companies, Inc. (“Anthem Insurance”), a wholly owned subsidiary, and is subordinate in right of payment to all of Anthem Insurance’s existing and future indebtedness. Any payment of interest or principal on the surplus note may be made only with the prior approval of the Indiana Department of Insurance (“IDOI”) and only out of capital and surplus funds of Anthem Insurance that the IDOI determines to be available for the payment under Indiana insurance laws.\nWe have a senior revolving credit facility (the “5-Year Facility”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The 5-Year Facility provides credit up to $\n2,500\nand matures in June 2024. On June 3, 2021, we terminated our 364-day senior revolving credit facility, which was scheduled to mature in June 2021 (the “prior 364-Day Facility”), and entered into a new 364-day senior revolving credit facility (the “new 364-Day Facility,” and together with the 5-Year Facility, the “Credit Facilities”) with a group of lenders for general corporate purposes. The new 364-Day Facility provides for credit in the amount of $\n1,000\nand matures in June 2022.\nOur ability to borrow under these credit facilities is subject to compliance with certain covenants, including covenants requiring us to maintain a defined debt-to-capital ratio of not more than 60%, subject to increase in certain circumstances set forth in the applicable credit agreement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our debt-to-capital ratio, as defined and calculated under the credit facilities, was 38.9%. We do not believe the restrictions contained in any of our credit facility covenants materially affect our financial or operating flexibility. As of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants under these credit facilities.\nThere were no amounts outstanding under the prior 364-Day Facility or the new 364-day Facility at any time during the years ended December 31, 2021 or the year ended December 31, 2020. At December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were no amounts outstanding under our 5-Year Facility.\nWe have an authorized commercial paper program of up to $\n3,500\n, the proceeds of which may be used for general corporate purposes. At December 31, 2021, we had $\n300\noutstanding under our commercial paper program with a weighted-average interest rate of\n0.150\n%. At December 31, 2020, we had $\n250\noutstanding under our commercial paper program with a weighted-average interest rate of\n0.160\n%. Commercial paper borrowings have been classified as long-term debt at December 31, 2021 and 2020, as our general practice and intent is to replace short-term commercial paper outstanding at expiration with additional short-term commercial paper for an uninterrupted period extending for more than one year, and we have the ability to redeem our commercial paper with borrowings under the senior revolving credit facilities described above.\nConvertible Debentures\nOn October 9, 2012, we issued $\n1,500\nof senior convertible debentures (the “Debentures”) in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers pursuant to Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The Debentures are governed by an indenture dated as of October 9, 2012 between us and The Bank of New York Mellon Trust Company, N.A., as trustee (the “Indenture”). The Debentures bear interest at a rate of\n2.750\n% per year, payable semi-annually in arrears in cash on April 15 and October 15 of each year, and mature on October 15, 2042, unless earlier redeemed, repurchased or converted into shares of common stock at the applicable conversion rate. The Debentures also have a contingent interest feature that will require us to pay additional interest based on certain thresholds and for certain events, as defined in the Indenture, beginning on October 15, 2022.\nHolders may convert their Debentures at their option prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding April 15, 2042, only under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least\n20\ntrading days during a period of\n30\nconsecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the preceding fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to\n130\n% of the applicable conversion price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period after any\n10\nconsecutive trading day period (the “measurement period”) in which the trading price per $\n1,000\n(whole dollars) principal amount of Debentures for each trading day of that measurement period was less than\n98\n% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate on each such day; (3) if we call any or all of the Debentures for redemption, at any time prior to the close of business on the third scheduled trading day prior to the redemption date; or (4) upon the occurrence of specified corporate events, as defined in the Indenture. On and after\nApril 15, 2042\nand until the close of business on the third scheduled trading day immediately preceding the Debentures’ maturity date of\nOctober 15, 2042\n, holders may convert their Debentures into common stock at any time irrespective of the preceding circumstances. The Debentures are redeemable at our option at any time on or after\nOctober 20, 2022\n, upon the occurrence of certain events, as defined in the Indenture.\n-121-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nUpon conversion of the Debentures, we will deliver cash up to the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures converted. With respect to any conversion obligation in excess of the aggregate principal amount of the Debentures converted, we have the option to settle the excess with cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof based on a daily conversion value, determined in accordance with the Indenture. The initial conversion rate for the Debentures was\n13.2319\nshares of our common stock per Debenture, which represented a\n25\n% conversion premium based on the closing price of $\n60.46\nper share of our common stock on October 2, 2012 (the date the Debentures’ terms were finalized) and is equivalent to an initial conversion price of $\n75.575\nper share of our common stock.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n54\naggregate principal amount of the Debentures was surrendered for conversion by certain holders in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the conversions with cash for total payments of $\n302\n. We recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debentures of $\n6\n, based on the fair values of the debt on the conversion settlement dates. During the year ended December 31, 2020, $\n56\naggregate principal amount of the Debentures was surrendered for conversion by certain holders in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the conversions with cash for total payments of $\n222\n. We recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debentures of $\n6\n, based on the fair values of the debt on the conversion settlement dates. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we repurchased $\n15\nof the aggregate principal balance of the Debentures. In addition, $\n57\naggregate principal amount of the Debentures was surrendered for conversion by certain holders in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Indenture. We elected to settle the excess of the principal amount of the repurchases and conversions with cash for total payments of $\n273\n. We recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt related to the Debentures of $\n2\n.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our common stock was last traded at a price of $\n463.54\nper share. If the remaining Debentures had been converted or matured at December 31, 2021, we would have been obligated to pay the principal of the Debentures plus an amount in cash or shares equal to $\n584\n. The Debentures and underlying shares of our common stock have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from registration requirements.\nWe have accounted for the Debentures in accordance with the cash conversion guidance in FASB guidance for debt with conversion and other options. As a result, the value of the embedded conversion option, net of deferred taxes and equity issuance costs, has been bifurcated from its debt host and recorded as a component of additional paid-in capital in our consolidated balance sheets.\nThe following table summarizes, at December 31, 2021, the related balances, conversion rate and conversion price of the Debentures:\nThe remaining amortization period of the unamortized debt discount as of December 31, 2021 is approximately\n21\nyears. The unamortized discount will be amortized into interest expense using the effective interest method based on an effective interest rate of\n5.130\n%, which represents the market interest rate for a comparable debt instrument that does not have a conversion feature. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $\n4\n, $\n6\nand $\n9\n, respectively, of interest expense related to the Debentures, of which $\n3\n, $\n5\nand $\n7\n, respectively, represented interest expense recognized at the stated interest rate of\n2.750\n% and $\n1\n, $\n1\nand $\n2\n, respectively, represented interest expense resulting from amortization of the debt discount.\nInterest paid on our total outstanding debt during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n822\n, $\n794\n, and $\n755\n, respectively.\nWe were in compliance with all applicable covenants under all of our outstanding debt agreements at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n-122-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nFuture maturities of all long-term debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 are as follows: 2022, $\n1,899\n; 2023, $\n1,513\n; 2024, $\n1,645\n; 2025, $\n1,253\n; 2026, $\n745\nand thereafter, $\n15,701\n.\n14.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nLitigation and Regulatory Proceedings\nIn the ordinary course of business, we are defendants in, or parties to, a number of pending or threatened legal actions or proceedings. To the extent a plaintiff or plaintiffs in the following cases have specified in their complaint or in other court filings the amount of damages being sought, we have noted those alleged damages in the descriptions below. With respect to the cases described below, we contest liability and/or the amount of damages in each matter and believe we have meritorious defenses.\nWhere available information indicates that it is probable that a loss has been incurred as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and we can reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, we accrue the estimated loss by a charge to income. In many proceedings, however, it is difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or reasonably possible. In addition, even where loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a previously identified loss contingency, it is not always possible to reasonably estimate the amount of the possible loss or range of loss.\nWith respect to many of the proceedings to which we are a party, we cannot provide an estimate of the possible losses, or the range of possible losses in excess of the amount, if any, accrued, for various reasons, including but not limited to some or all of the following: (i) there are novel or unsettled legal issues presented, (ii) the proceedings are in early stages, (iii) there is uncertainty as to the likelihood of a class being certified or decertified or the ultimate size and scope of the class, (iv) there is uncertainty as to the outcome of pending appeals or motions, (v) there are significant factual issues to be resolved, and/or (vi) in many cases, the plaintiffs have not specified damages in their complaint or in court filings. For those legal proceedings where a loss is probable, or reasonably possible, and for which it is possible to reasonably estimate the amount of the possible loss or range of losses, we currently believe that the range of possible losses, in excess of established reserves is, in the aggregate, from $\n0\nto approximately $\n250\nat December 31, 2021. This estimated aggregate range of reasonably possible losses is based upon currently available information taking into account our best estimate of such losses for which such an estimate can be made.\nBlue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\nWe are a defendant in multiple lawsuits that were initially filed in 2012 against the BCBSA and Blue Cross and/or Blue Shield licensees (the “Blue plans”) across the country. Cases filed in twenty-eight states were consolidated into a single, multi-district proceeding captioned\nIn re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litigation\nthat is pending in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Alabama (the “Court”). Generally, the suits allege that the BCBSA and the Blue plans have conspired to horizontally allocate geographic markets through license agreements, best efforts rules that limit the percentage of non-Blue revenue of each plan, restrictions on acquisitions, rules governing the BlueCard\n®\nand National Accounts programs and other arrangements in violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act (“Sherman Act”) and related state laws. The cases were brought by two putative nationwide classes of plaintiffs, health plan subscribers and providers.\nIn April 2018, the Court issued an order on the parties’ cross motions for partial summary judgment, determining that the defendants’ aggregation of geographic market allocations and output restrictions are to be analyzed under a per se standard of review, and the BlueCard\n®\nprogram and other alleged Section 1 Sherman Act violations are to be analyzed under the rule of reason standard of review. The Court also found that there remain genuine issues of material fact as to whether the defendants operate as a single entity with regard to the enforcement of the Blue Cross Blue Shield trademarks. In April 2019, the plaintiffs filed motions for class certification, which defendants opposed.\nThe BCBSA and Blue plans have approved a settlement agreement and release (the “Subscriber Settlement Agreement”) with the subscriber plaintiffs. If approved by the Court, the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will require the defendants to make a monetary settlement payment, our portion of which is estimated to be $\n594\n, and will contain certain terms imposing non-monetary obligations including (i) eliminating the “national best efforts” rule in the BCBSA license agreements (which rule limits the percentage of non-Blue revenue permitted for each Blue plan) and (ii) allowing for some large national employers with self-funded benefit plans to request a bid for insurance coverage from a second Blue plan in addition to the\n-123-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nlocal Blue plan. As of December 31, 2021, the liability balance accrued for our estimated payment obligation was $\n507\n, net of payments made.\nIn November 2020, the Court issued an order preliminarily approving the Subscriber Settlement Agreement, following which members of the subscriber class were provided notice of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement and an opportunity to opt out of the class. All terms of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement are subject to final approval by the Court. The deadline for objections to the settlement as well as the deadline for those who wish to opt-out from the settlement was in July 2021 and a small number of subscribers submitted valid opt outs by the deadline. The claims deadline was in November 2021 and in excess of\neight thousand\nclaims were submitted. A final approval hearing was held in October 2021. The Court took the request for approval under advisement and requested supplemental briefing that has been submitted. If the Court grants approval of the Subscriber Settlement Agreement, and after all appellate rights have expired or have been exhausted in a manner that affirms the Court’s final order and judgment, the defendants’ payment and non-monetary obligations under the Subscriber Settlement Agreement will become effective.\nIn October 2020, after the Court lifted the stay as to the provider litigation, provider plaintiffs filed a renewed motion for class certification, which defendants opposed. In March 2021, the Court issued an order terminating the pending motion for class certification until the Court determines the standard of review applicable to providers’ claims. In May 2021, the defendants and provider plaintiffs filed renewed standard of review motions, which are now fully briefed. In June 2021, the parties filed summary judgment motions not critically dependent on class certification, which are now fully briefed and no decision has been rendered. We intend to continue to vigorously defend the provider suit, which we believe is without merit; however, its ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\nBlue Cross of California Taxation Litigation\nIn July 2013, our California affiliate Blue Cross of California (doing business as Anthem Blue Cross) (“BCC”) was named as a defendant in a California taxpayer action filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court (the “Superior Court”) captioned\nMichael D. Myers v. State Board of Equalization, et al.\nThis action was brought under a California statute that permits an individual taxpayer to sue a governmental agency when the taxpayer believes the agency has failed to enforce governing law. Plaintiff contends that BCC, a licensed Health Care Service Plan, is an “insurer” for purposes of taxation despite acknowledging it is not an “insurer” under regulatory law. At the time, under California law, “insurers” were required to pay a gross premiums tax (“GPT”) calculated as\n2.35\n% on gross premiums. As a licensed Health Care Service Plan, BCC has paid the California Corporate Franchise Tax (“CFT”), the tax paid by California businesses generally. Plaintiff contends that BCC must pay the GPT rather than the CFT, and seeks a writ of mandate directing the taxing agencies to collect the GPT and an order requiring BCC to pay GPT back taxes, interest, and penalties for the eight-year period prior to the filing of the complaint.\nBecause the GPT is constitutionally imposed in lieu of certain other taxes, BCC has filed protective tax refund claims with the City of Los Angeles, the California Department of Health Care Services and the Franchise Tax Board to protect its rights to recover certain taxes previously paid should BCC eventually be determined to be subject to the GPT for the tax periods at issue in the litigation.\nIn March 2018, the Superior Court denied BCC's motion for judgment on the pleadings and similar motions brought by other entities. BCC filed a motion for summary judgment with the Superior Court, which was heard in October 2020. In December 2020, the Superior Court granted BCC’s motion for summary judgment, dismissing the plaintiff's lawsuit. In November 2021, the plaintiff appealed the order granting our motion for summary judgment. Our responding brief is due in February 2022. We estimate that the appeal will be heard some time in 2022. We intend to vigorously defend the appeal of this lawsuit.\nExpress Scripts, Inc. Pharmacy Benefit Management Litigation\nIn March 2016, we filed a lawsuit against Express Scripts, Inc. (“Express Scripts”), our vendor at the time for PBM services, captioned\nAnthem, Inc. v. Express Scripts, Inc.\n, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The lawsuit seeks to recover over $\n14,800\nin damages for pharmacy pricing that is higher than competitive benchmark pricing under the agreement between the parties (the “ESI PBM Agreement”), over $\n158\nin damages related to operational breaches, as well as various declarations under the ESI PBM Agreement, including that Express Scripts: (i) breached its obligation to negotiate in good faith and to agree in writing to new pricing terms; (ii) was required to provide competitive\n-124-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nbenchmark pricing to us through the term of the ESI PBM Agreement; (iii) has breached the ESI PBM Agreement; and (iv) is required under the ESI PBM Agreement to provide post-termination services, at competitive benchmark pricing, for one year following any termination.\nExpress Scripts has disputed our contractual claims and is seeking declaratory judgments: (i) regarding the timing of the periodic pricing review under the ESI PBM Agreement, and (ii) that it has no obligation to ensure that we receive any specific level of pricing, that we have no contractual right to any change in pricing under the ESI PBM Agreement and that its sole obligation is to negotiate proposed pricing terms in good faith. In the alternative, Express Scripts claims that we have been unjustly enriched by its payment of $\n4,675\nat the time we entered into the ESI PBM Agreement. In March 2017, the court granted our motion to dismiss Express Scripts’ counterclaims for (i) breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing, and (ii) unjust enrichment with prejudice. The only remaining claims are for breach of contract and declaratory relief. In August 2021, Express Scripts filed a motion for summary judgment, which we opposed. Express Scripts’ motion for summary judgment is now fully briefed and no decision has been rendered. We intend to vigorously pursue our claims and defend against any counterclaims, which we believe are without merit; however, the ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\nIn re Express Scripts/Anthem ERISA Litigation\nWe are a defendant in a class action lawsuit that was initially filed in June 2016 against Anthem, Inc. and Express Scripts, which has been consolidated into a single multi-district lawsuit captioned\nIn Re Express Scripts/Anthem ERISA Litigation,\nin the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The consolidated complaint was filed by plaintiffs against Express Scripts and us on behalf of all persons who are participants in or beneficiaries of any ERISA or non-ERISA healthcare plan from December 1, 2009 to December 31, 2019 in which we provided prescription drug benefits through the ESI PBM Agreement and paid a percentage based co-insurance payment in the course of using that prescription drug benefit. The plaintiffs allege that we breached our duties, either under ERISA or with respect to the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing implied in the health plans, (i) by failing to adequately monitor Express Scripts’ pricing under the ESI PBM Agreement, (ii) by placing our own pecuniary interest above the best interests of our insureds by allegedly agreeing to higher pricing in the ESI PBM Agreement in exchange for the purchase price for our NextRx PBM business, and (iii) with respect to the non-ERISA members, by negotiating and entering into the ESI PBM Agreement that was allegedly detrimental to the interests of such non-ERISA members. Plaintiffs seek to hold us and Express Scripts jointly and severally liable and to recover all losses suffered by the proposed class, equitable relief, disgorgement of alleged ill-gotten gains, injunctive relief, attorney’s fees and costs and interest.\nIn April 2017, we filed a motion to dismiss the claims brought against us, and it was granted, without prejudice, in January 2018. Plaintiffs pursued an appeal with the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (the “Second Circuit”). In December 2020, the Second Circuit affirmed the trial court’s order dismissing the ERISA complaint. Plaintiffs filed a Petition for Rehearing and Rehearing En Banc, which was denied. Plaintiffs filed a writ of certiorari with the United States Supreme Court, which we opposed. In December 2021, the United States Supreme Court requested that the Solicitor General submit a brief “expressing the views of the United States” as to whether the Court should grant plaintiffs’ writ. We intend to vigorously defend this suit, which we believe is without merit; however, its ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\nMedicare Risk Adjustment Litigation\nIn March 2020, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) filed a civil lawsuit against Anthem, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York in a case captioned\nUnited States v. Anthem, Inc\n. The DOJ’s suit alleges, among other things, that we falsely certified the accuracy of the diagnosis data we submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (“CMS”) for risk-adjustment purposes under Medicare Part C and knowingly failed to delete inaccurate diagnosis codes. The DOJ further alleges that, as a result of these purported acts, we caused CMS to calculate the risk-adjustment payments based on inaccurate diagnosis information, which enabled us to obtain unspecified amounts of payments in Medicare funds in violation of the False Claims Act. The DOJ filed an amended complaint in July 2020, alleging the same causes of action but revising some of its allegations. In September 2020, we filed a motion to transfer the lawsuit to the Southern District of Ohio, a motion to dismiss part of the lawsuit, and a motion to strike certain allegations in the amended complaint. The motions are fully briefed and no decision has been rendered. We intend to continue to vigorously defend this suit, which we believe is without merit; however, the ultimate outcome cannot be presently determined.\n-125-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nInvestigations of CareMore and HealthSun\nWith the assistance of outside counsel, we are conducting investigations of risk-adjustment practices involving data submitted to CMS (unrelated to our retrospective chart review program) at CareMore Health Plans, Inc. (“CareMore”), one of our California subsidiaries, and HealthSun Health Plans, Inc. (“HealthSun”), one of our Florida subsidiaries. Our CareMore investigation has resulted in the termination of CareMore’s relationship with one contracted provider in California. Our HealthSun investigation has focused on risk adjustment practices initiated prior to our acquisition of HealthSun in December 2017 that continued after the acquisition. We have voluntarily self-disclosed the existence of both of our investigations to CMS and the Criminal and Civil Divisions of the DOJ. We are cooperating with the ongoing investigations of the Criminal and Civil Divisions of the DOJ related to these risk adjustment practices, and have entered into a tolling agreement with the Civil Division of the DOJ related to its investigation. We are analyzing the scope of potential data corrections to be submitted to CMS and have begun to submit data corrections to CMS. We have also asserted indemnity claims for escrowed funds under the HealthSun purchase agreement for, among other things, breach of healthcare and financial representation provisions, based on the conduct discovered during our investigation. In the fourth quarter of 2021, we resolved matters with both groups of sellers related to our indemnity claims for escrowed funds under the HealthSun purchase agreement based on conduct discovered during our investigation.\nOther Contingencies\nFrom time to time, we and certain of our subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, many of which involve claims for coverage encountered in the ordinary course of business. We, like Health Maintenance Organizations (“HMOs”) and health insurers generally, exclude certain healthcare and other services from coverage under our HMO, Preferred Provider Organizations and other plans. We are, in the ordinary course of business, subject to the claims of our enrollees arising out of decisions to restrict or deny reimbursement for uncovered services. The loss of even one such claim, if it results in a significant punitive damage award, could have a material adverse effect on us. In addition, the risk of potential liability under punitive damage theories may increase significantly the difficulty of obtaining reasonable reimbursement of coverage claims.\nIn addition to the lawsuits described above, we are also involved in other pending and threatened litigation of the character incidental to our business, and are from time to time involved as a party in various governmental investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings. These investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings include routine and special inquiries by state insurance departments, state attorneys general, the U.S. Attorney General and subcommittees of the U.S. Congress. Such investigations, audits, reviews and administrative proceedings could result in the imposition of civil or criminal fines, penalties, other sanctions and additional rules, regulations or other restrictions on our business operations. Any liability that may result from any one of these actions, or in the aggregate, could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations.\nContractual Obligations and Commitments\nIn March 2020, we entered into an agreement with a vendor for information technology infrastructure and related management and support services through June 2025. The new agreement supersedes certain prior agreements for such services and includes provisions for additional services not provided under those agreements. Our remaining commitment under this agreement at December 31, 2021 is approximately $\n1,051\n. We will have the ability to terminate the agreement upon the occurrence of certain events, subject to early termination fees.\nIn the second quarter of 2019, we began using our pharmacy benefits manager IngenioRx to market and offer PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers, as well as to external customers outside of the health plans we own. The comprehensive prescription benefits management services portfolio includes, but is not limited to, formulary management, pharmacy networks, prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities. IngenioRx delegates certain PBM administrative functions, such as claims processing and prescription fulfillment, to CaremarkPCS Health, L.L.C., which is a subsidiary of CVS Health Corporation, pursuant to a five-year agreement. With IngenioRx, we retain the responsibilities for clinical and formulary strategy and development, member and employer experiences, operations, sales, marketing, account management and retail network strategy.\n-126-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nVulnerability from Concentrations\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents, investment securities, premium receivables and instruments held through hedging activities. All investment securities are managed by professional investment managers within policies authorized by our Board of Directors. Such policies limit the amounts that may be invested in any one issuer and prescribe certain investee company criteria. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to premium receivables are limited due to the large number of employer groups that constitute our customer base in the states in which we conduct business. As of December 31, 2021, there were no significant concentrations of financial instruments in a single investee, industry or geographic location.\n15.\nCapital Stock\nStock Incentive Plan\ns\nOur Board of Directors has adopted the 2017 Anthem Incentive Compensation Plan (“2017 Incentive Plan”), which has been approved by our shareholders. The term of the 2017 Incentive Plan is such that no awards may be granted on or after May 18, 2027. The 2017 Incentive Plan gives authority to the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors to make incentive awards to our non-employee directors, employees and consultants, consisting of stock options, stock, restricted stock, restricted stock units, cash-based awards, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and performance units. The 2017 Incentive Plan limits the number of available shares for issuance to\n37.5\nshares, subject to adjustment as set forth in the 2017 Incentive Plan.\nStock options are granted for a fixed number of shares with an exercise price at least equal to the fair value of the shares at the grant date. Stock options vest over\nthree years\nin equal annual installments and generally have a term of\nten years\nfrom the grant date.\nCertain option grants contain provisions whereby the employee continues to vest in the award subsequent to termination due to retirement. Our attribution method for newly granted awards considers all vesting and other provisions, including retirement eligibility, in determining the requisite service period over which the fair value of the awards will be recognized.\nAwards of restricted stock or restricted stock units are issued at the fair value of the stock on the grant date and may also include one or more performance measures that must be met for the award to vest. For restricted stock or restricted stock units without performance measures, the restrictions lapse in three equal annual installments. Restricted stock or restricted stock units with performance measures vest in three year installments. Performance units issued in 2021 will vest in 2024, based on certain revenue and earnings targets over the three year period of 2021 to 2023. Performance units issued in 2020 will vest in 2023, based on certain revenue and earnings targets over the three year period of 2020 to 2022. Performance units issued in 2019 will vest in 2022, based on certain revenue and earnings targets over the three year period of 2019 to 2021.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized share-based compensation expense of $\n255\n, $\n283\nand $\n294\n, respectively, as well as related tax benefits of $\n65\n, $\n74\nand $\n78\n, respectively.\nA summary of stock option activity for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nThe intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted to $\n121\n, $\n147\nand $\n188\n, respectively. We recognized tax benefits of $\n32\n, $\n40\nand $\n52\nduring the years ended December 31, 2021,\n-127-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n2020 and 2019, respectively, from option exercises and disqualifying dispositions. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received cash of $\n148\n, $\n129\nand $\n143\n, respectively, from exercises of stock options.\nThe total fair value of restricted stock awards that vested during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n287\n, $\n335\nand $\n245\n, respectively.\nA summary of the status of nonvested restricted stock activity, including restricted stock units and performance units, for the year ended December 31, 2021 is as follows:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we granted approximately\n0.3\nrestricted stock units that are contingent upon us achieving certain revenue and earnings targets over the three year period of 2021 to 2023. These grants have been included in the activity shown above, but will be subject to adjustment at the end of 2023, based on results in the three year period.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the total remaining unrecognized compensation expense related to nonvested stock options and restricted stock, including restricted stock units and performance units, amounted to $\n33\nand $\n165\n, respectively, which will be amortized over the weighted-average remaining requisite service periods of\n10\nmonths and\n13\nmonths, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were approximately\n15.8\nshares of common stock available for future grants under the 2017 Incentive Plan.\nFair Value\nWe use a binomial lattice valuation model to estimate the fair value of all stock options granted. Expected volatility assumptions used in the binomial lattice model are based on an analysis of implied volatilities of publicly traded options on our stock and historical volatility of our stock price. The risk-free interest rate is derived from the U.S. Treasury strip rates at the time of the grant. The expected term of the options was derived from the outputs of the binomial lattice model, which incorporates post-vesting forfeiture assumptions based on an analysis of historical data. The dividend yield was based on our estimate of future dividend yields. Similar groups of employees that have dissimilar exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. We utilize the multiple-grant approach for recognizing compensation expense associated with each separately vesting portion of the share-based award.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to estimate the fair values of options granted during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n-128-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe following weighted-average fair values were determined for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nThe binomial lattice option-pricing model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because our stock option grants have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in our opinion, existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of our stock option grants.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe have registered\n14.0\nshares of common stock for the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Stock Purchase Plan”), which is intended to provide a means to encourage and assist employees in acquiring a stock ownership interest in Anthem. Pursuant to the terms of the Stock Purchase Plan, an eligible employee is permitted to purchase no more than $\n25,000\n(actual dollars) worth of stock in any calendar year, based on the fair value of the stock at the end of each plan quarter. Employees become participants by electing payroll deductions from\n1\n% to\n15\n% of gross compensation. Once purchased, the stock is accumulated in the employee’s investment account. The Stock Purchase Plan allows participants to purchase shares of our common stock at a discounted price per share of\n90\n% of the fair value of a share of common stock on the lower of the first or last trading day of the plan quarter purchase period. The Stock Purchase Plan discount was recognized as compensation expense for the year ended December 31, 2021, based on GAAP guidance. There were\n0.1\nshares issued during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021,\n4.5\nshares were available for issuance under the Stock Purchase Plan.\nUse of Capital and Stock Repurchase Program\nWe regularly review the appropriate use of capital, including acquisitions, common stock and debt security repurchases and dividends to shareholders. The declaration and payment of any dividends or repurchases of our common stock or debt is at the discretion of our Board of Directors and depends upon our financial condition, results of operations, future liquidity needs, regulatory and capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by our Board of Directors.\nA summary of the cash dividend activity for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nOn January 25, 2022, our Audit Committee declared a quarterly cash dividend to shareholders of $\n1.28\nper share on the outstanding shares of our common stock. This quarterly dividend is payable on\nMarch 25, 2022\nto the shareholders of record as of\nMarch 10, 2022\n.\nUnder our Board of Directors’ authorization, we maintain a common stock repurchase program. On January 26, 2021, our Audit Committee, pursuant to authorization granted by the Board of Directors, authorized a $\n5,000\nincrease to our\n-129-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\ncommon stock repurchase program. Repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices, subject to certain restrictions on volume, pricing and timing. The repurchases are effected from time to time in the open market, through negotiated transactions, including accelerated share repurchase agreements, and through plans designed to comply with Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. Our stock repurchase program is discretionary, as we are under no obligation to repurchase shares. We repurchase shares under the program when we believe it is a prudent use of capital. The excess cost of the repurchased shares over par value is charged on a pro rata basis to additional paid-in capital and retained earnings.\nA summary of common stock repurchases for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nWe expect to utilize the remaining authorized amount over a multi-year period, subject to market and industry conditions.\nFor additional information regarding the use of capital for debt security repurchases, see Note 13, “Debt.”\n-130-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n16.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive (Loss) Income\nA reconciliation of the components of accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income at December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 is as follows:\n-131-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n17.\nReinsurance\nWe reinsure certain risks with other companies and assume risk from other companies. We remain primarily liable to policyholders under ceded insurance contracts and are contingently liable for amounts recoverable from reinsurers in the event that such reinsurers do not meet their contractual obligations.\nA summary of direct, assumed and ceded premiums earned for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe difference between written premiums and earned premiums is immaterial in each of the years presented above.\nA summary of net premiums earned by segment (see Note 20, “Segment Information”) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe effect of reinsurance on benefit expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe effect of reinsurance on certain assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n-132-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n18.\nLeases\nWe lease office space and certain computer and related equipment using noncancelable operating leases. Our leases have remaining lease terms of\n1\nyear to\n13\nyears.\nThe information related to our leases is as follows:\nOur activities as disclosed in Note 4, “Business Optimization Initiatives”, include reducing our office space footprint. As a result, we performed an interim impairment test during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 and recorded impairment charges of $\n136\nand $\n258\n, respectively, for impairment and abandonment of ROU assets which are included in the operating lease expense shown above.\nAt December 31, 2021, future lease payments for noncancelable operating leases with initial or remaining terms of one year or more are as follows:\n-133-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\n19.\nEarnings per Share\nThe denominator for basic and diluted earnings per share at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, weighted-average shares related to certain stock options of\n0.2\n,\n1.2\nand\n0.6\n, respectively, were excluded from the denominator for diluted earnings per share because the stock options were anti-dilutive.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we issued approximately\n0.3\n,\n0.3\nand\n0.2\nrestricted stock units, respectively, of which vesting was contingent upon us meeting certain earnings targets. Contingent restricted stock units are excluded from the denominator for diluted earnings per share and are included only if and when the contingency is met. The 2021 contingent restricted stock units are being measured over the three year period of 2021 through 2023, the 2020 contingent restricted stock units are being measured over the three year period of 2020 through 2022 and the 2019 contingent restricted stock units are being measured over the three year period of 2019 through 2021. Contingent restricted stock units generally vest in March of the year following each measurement period.\n20.\nSegment Information\nBeginning in 2020, IngenioRx met the quantitative threshold for a reportable segment based on the FASB guidance. The results of our operations are now described through\nfour\nreportable segments: Commercial & Specialty Business, Government Business, IngenioRx and Other.\nOur Commercial & Specialty Business segment offers plans and services to our Individual, Group risk-based, Group fee-based and BlueCard\n®\nmembers. The Commercial & Specialty Business segment offers health products on a full-risk basis; provides a broad array of administrative managed care services to our fee-based customers; and provides a variety of specialty and other insurance products and services such as dental, vision, life, disability and supplemental health insurance benefits.\nOur Government Business segment includes our Medicare and Medicaid businesses, National Government Services (“NGS”) and services provided to the federal government in connection with the FEHB business.\nOur IngenioRx segment includes our PBM business. IngenioRx markets and offers PBM services to our affiliated health plan customers, as well as to external customers outside of the health plans we own. IngenioRx has a comprehensive PBM services portfolio, which includes services such as formulary management, pharmacy networks, prescription drug database, member services and mail order capabilities.\nOur Other segment includes our Diversified Business Group, which is our health services business focused on lowering the cost and improving the quality of healthcare by enabling and creating new care delivery and payment models, with a special emphasis on serving those with complex and chronic conditions. This segment also includes certain eliminations and corporate expenses not allocated to our other reportable segments.\nWe define operating revenues to include premium income, product revenue and administrative fees and other revenues. Operating revenues are derived from premiums and fees received, primarily from the sale and administration of health benefit and pharmacy products and services. Operating gain is calculated as total operating revenue less benefit expense, cost of products sold and selling, general and administrative expense.\nAffiliated revenues represent revenues or costs for services provided to our subsidiaries by IngenioRx and our Diversified Business Group, as well as certain back-office services provided by our international businesses, and are recorded at cost or management’s estimate of fair market value. These affiliated revenues are eliminated in consolidation.\n-134-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThrough our participation in various federal government programs, we generated approximately\n20.7\n%,\n20.3\n% and\n20.7\n% of our total consolidated revenues from agencies of the U.S. government for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. These revenues are contained in the Government Business segment.\nThe accounting policies of the segments are consistent with those described in the summary of significant accounting policies in Note 2, “Basis of Presentation and Significant Accounting Policies,” except that certain shared administrative expenses for each segment are recognized on a pro rata allocated basis, which in the aggregate approximates the consolidated expense. Any difference between the allocated expenses and actual consolidated expense is included in other expenses not allocated to reportable segments. We evaluate performance of the reportable segments based on operating gain or loss as defined above. We evaluate net investment income, net gains (losses) on financial instruments, interest expense, amortization expense, gain or loss on extinguishment of debt, income taxes and assets and liabilities on a consolidated basis, as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of segment operating management.\nFor our 2019 segment reporting, operating gain generated from IngenioRx activities was allocated and included in our Commercial & Specialty Business and Government Business based upon their utilization of those services, which aligns with the method by which we assessed the 2019 operating performance of our reportable segments. Beginning January 1, 2020, we are managing the operating performance of each of our segments on a standalone basis. Prior year 2019 allocations were not restated to conform to the 2020 presentation; however, operating margins for IngenioRx were approximately\n8\n% in 2019.\nFinancial data by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n-135-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nThe major product revenues for each of the reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nThe classification between managed care products and managed care services in the above table primarily distinguishes between the levels of risk assumed. Managed care products represent insurance products where we bear the insurance risk, whereas managed care services represent product offerings where we provide claims adjudication and other administrative services to the customer, but the customer principally bears the insurance risk.\nAsset, liability and equity details by reportable segment have not been disclosed, as we do not internally report such information.\nA reconciliation of reportable segments’ operating revenue to the amounts of total revenues included in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n-136-\nAnthem, Inc.\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements (continued)\nA reconciliation of reportable segments’ operating gain to income before income tax expense included in our consolidated statements of income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n21.\nRelated Party Transactions\nWe have an equity investment in APC Passe, LLC, which offers Medicaid products in Arkansas. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, in the normal course of business, we assumed premiums of $\n462\nand $\n446\n, respectively, from APC Passe, LLC, which is included in our total assumed premiums (see Note 17, “Reinsurance”).\n22.\nStatutory Information\nThe majority of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries report their accounts in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by state insurance regulatory authorities, commonly referred to as statutory accounting, which vary in certain respects from GAAP. However, certain of our insurance and HMO subsidiaries, including BCC, Blue Cross of California Partnership Plan, Inc., Golden West Health Plan, Inc., Beacon Health Options of California, Inc. and CareMore Health Plan are regulated by the California Department of Managed Health Care (“DMHC”) and report their accounts in conformity with GAAP (these entities are collectively referred to as the “DMHC regulated entities”). Typical differences of GAAP reporting as compared to statutory reporting are the recognition of all assets including those that are non-admitted for statutory purposes and recognition of all deferred tax assets without regard to statutory limits. The National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) developed a codified version of the statutory accounting principles, designed to foster more consistency among the states for accounting guidelines and reporting. Prescribed statutory accounting practices are set forth in a variety of publications of the NAIC as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules.\nOur statutory basis insurance and HMO subsidiaries are subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements. RBC is a method developed by the NAIC to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company or HMO to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile. The formula for determining the amount of RBC specifies various factors, weighted based on the perceived degree of risk, which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity. Below minimum RBC requirements are classified within certain levels, each of which requires specified corrective action. Additionally, the DMHC regulated entities are subject to capital and solvency requirements as prescribed by the DMHC. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, all of our regulated subsidiaries exceeded the minimum applicable mandatory RBC requirements and/or capital and solvency requirements of their applicable governmental regulator.\nThe statutory RBC necessary to satisfy regulatory requirements of our statutory basis insurance and HMO subsidiaries was approximately\n6,962\nand $\n5,800\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The tangible net equity required for the DMHC regulated entities was approximately $\n690\nand $\n600\nas of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

    "text": "Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nWe carried out an evaluation as of December 31, 2021, under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in Rule 13a-15(e) of the Exchange Act. Based upon that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures are effective in timely alerting them to material information relating to us (including our consolidated subsidiaries) required to be disclosed in our reports under the Exchange Act. In addition, based on that evaluation, our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective in ensuring that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, of Anthem, Inc. (the “Company”) is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting (“Internal Control”), as such term is defined in the Exchange Act. The Company’s Internal Control is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of the Company’s financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP. The Company’s Internal Control includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and that receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the Company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of inherent limitations in any Internal Control, no matter how well designed, misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected. Accordingly, even effective Internal Control can provide only reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nManagement, under the supervision and with the participation of the principal executive officer and principal financial officer, assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control as of December 31, 2021. Management’s assessment was based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission.\nThe Company completed its acquisitions of myNEXUS, Inc. and MMM Holdings, LLC on April 28, 2021 and June 29, 2021, respectively. As permitted by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, management’s assessment as of December 31, 2021 did not include the Internal Control of myNEXUS, Inc. and MMM Holdings, LLC, which are included in the Company's consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021. Such operations of myNEXUS, Inc. and MMM Holdings, LLC constituted 5% and 11% of the Company’s total assets and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and 2% and 0% of the Company's total revenues and net income for the year then ended.\n-138-\nBased on management’s assessment, which excluded assessments of Internal Control of myNEXUS, Inc. and MMM Holdings, LLC, management has concluded that the Company’s Internal Control was effective as of December 31, 2021 to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with GAAP.\nErnst & Young LLP, the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, has audited the consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year ended December 31, 2021, and has also issued an audit report dated February 16, 2022, on the effectiveness of the Company’s Internal Control as of December 31, 2021, which is included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the three months ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting.\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Anthem, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Anthem, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control–Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Anthem, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of myNEXUS, Inc. and MMM Holdings, LLC, which are included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 5% and 11% of total and net assets, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2% and 0% of revenues and net income, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include evaluations of the internal control over financial reporting of myNEXUS, Inc. and MMM Holdings, LLC.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of Anthem, Inc. as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(c) and our report dated February 16, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk,\n-139-\nand performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/    Ernst & Young LLP\nIndianapolis, Indiana\nFebruary 16, 2022\n-140-"
