    "text": "Overview\nTrane Technologies, public limited company (plc), incorporated in Ireland in 2009, and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively we, our, the Company) is a global climate innovator. We bring sustainable and efficient solutions to buildings, homes and transportation through our strategic brands, Trane\n®\nand Thermo King\n®\n, and our environmentally responsible portfolio of products, services and connected intelligent controls. We generate revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sales and service of solutions for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and transport refrigeration. As an industry leader with an extensive global install base, our growth strategy includes expanding recurring revenue through services and rental options. Our unique business operating system, uplifting culture and highly engaged team around the world are also central to our earnings and cash flow growth.\nThrough our sustainability-focused strategy and purpose to\nboldly challenge what’s possible for a sustainable world\n, we meet critical needs and growing global demand for innovation that reduces greenhouse gas emissions while enabling healthier, efficient indoor environments and safe, reliable delivery of essential temperature-controlled cargo. We have announced certain defined sustainability commitments with a goal of achieving these commitments by 2030 (2030 Sustainability Commitments). Trane Technologies’ bold 2030 Sustainability Commitments have been verified by the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) and include our ‘Gigaton Challenge’ to reduce customer greenhouse gas emissions by a billion metric tons, ‘Leading by Example’ through carbon-neutral operations across our own footprint, and ‘Opportunity for All’ by building a diverse workforce reflective of our communities.\nReportable Segments\nWe have three regional operating segments which are also our reportable segments.\n•\nOur Americas segment innovates for customers in North America and Latin America. The Americas segment encompasses commercial heating and cooling systems, building controls, and energy services and solutions; residential heating and cooling; and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. This segment had 2021 net revenues of $11.0 billion.\n•\nOur EMEA segment innovates for customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The EMEA segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and industrial processing, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. This segment had 2021 net revenues of $1.9 billion.\n•\nOur Asia Pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions. This segment had 2021 net revenues of $1.2 billion.\n4\nProducts and Services\nOur principal products and services include the following:\nThese products are sold primarily under our tradenames including Trane\n®\nand Thermo King\n®\n.\nCompetitive Conditions\nOur products and services are sold in highly competitive markets throughout the world. Due to the diversity of these products and services and the variety of markets served, we encounter a wide variety of competitors that vary by product line and services. They include well-established regional or specialized competitors, as well as larger U.S. and non-U.S. corporations or divisions of larger companies.\nThe principal methods of competition in these markets relate to price, quality, delivery, service and support, technology and innovation. We are one of the leading manufacturers in the world of HVAC systems and services and transport temperature control products and services.\nDistribution\nOur products are distributed by a number of methods, which we believe are appropriate to the type of product. U.S. sales are made through branch sales offices, distributors and dealers across the country. Non-U.S. sales are made through numerous subsidiary sales and service companies with a supporting chain of distributors throughout the world.\nOperations by Geographic Area\nApproximately 29% of our net revenues in 2021 were derived outside the U.S. and we sold products in approximately 100 countries. Therefore, the attendant risks of manufacturing or selling in a particular country, such as currency devaluation, nationalization and establishment of common markets, may have an adverse impact on our non-U.S. operations.\n5\nCustomers\nWe have no customer that accounted for more than 10% of our consolidated net revenues in 2021, 2020 or 2019. No material part of our business is dependent upon a single customer or a small group of customers; therefore, the loss of any one customer would not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows.\nRaw Materials\nWe manufacture many of the components included in our products, which requires us to source a wide variety of commodities. Principal commodities, such as steel, copper and aluminum, are purchased from a large number of independent sources around the world, primarily within the region where the products are manufactured. We believe that available sources of supply will generally be sufficient for the foreseeable future.\nSeasonality\nDemand for certain of our products and services is influenced by weather conditions. For instance, sales in our commercial and residential HVAC businesses historically tend to be higher in the second and third quarters of the year because this represents spring and summer in the U.S. and other northern hemisphere markets, which are the peak seasons for sales of air conditioning systems and services. Therefore, results of any quarterly period may not be indicative of expected results for a full year and unusual weather patterns or events could positively or negatively affect certain segments of our business and impact overall results of operations.\nResearch and Development\nWe engage in research and development activities in an effort to introduce new products, enhance existing product effectiveness, improve ease of use and reliability as well as expand the various applications for which our products may be appropriate. In 2021, we spent $193.5 million on research and development, focused on product and system sustainability improvements such as increasing energy efficiency, developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants, reducing material content in products, and designing products for circularity. All new product development (NPD) programs must complete a Design for Sustainability module within our NPD process to ensure that every program has a positive impact on sustainability.\nWe also have a strong focus on sustaining activities, which include costs incurred to reduce production costs, improve existing products, create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities. We anticipate that we will continue to make significant expenditures for research and development and sustaining activities as we look to maintain and improve our competitive position.\nPatents and Licenses\nOur intellectual property rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes, and other confidential information. Although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. In our opinion, engineering, production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our intellectual property rights.\n6\nBacklog\nOur backlog of orders, believed to be firm, at December 31, was as follows:\nThese backlog figures are based on orders received and only include amounts associated with our equipment and contracting and installation performance obligations. A major portion of our residential products are built in advance of order and either shipped or assembled from stock. As a result, we expect to ship a majority of the December 31, 2021 backlog during 2022. However, orders for specialized machinery or specific customer applications are submitted with extensive lead times and are often subject to revision and deferral, and to a lesser extent cancellation or termination. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced significant increases in end market demand for our sustainability-focused products and services resulting in a higher backlog of orders in the current year as compared to prior year. In addition, we are seeing industry-wide supply chain and resource constraints impacting our ability to produce and ship product which we are proactively managing. To the extent projects are delayed or there are additional supply chain and resource constraints, the timing of our revenue could be affected.\nEnvironmental Matters\nWe continue to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources, and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, we are currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities and off-site waste disposal facilities.\nIt is our policy to establish environmental reserves for investigation and remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. Estimated liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown environmental conditions, changes in government laws and regulations, and changes in cleanup technologies. The environmental reserves are updated on a routine basis as remediation efforts progress and new information becomes available.\nWe are sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and have received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state and international authorities. We have also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. In most instances at multi-party sites, our share of the liability is not material.\nIn estimating our liability at multi-party sites, we have assumed that we will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on our understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis.\nFor a further discussion of our potential environmental liabilities, see Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n7\nSeparation of Industrial Segment Businesses\nOn February 29, 2020 (Distribution Date), we completed our Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction) with Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc. (Gardner Denver, which changed its name to Ingersoll Rand Inc. (Ingersoll Rand) after the Transaction) whereby we distributed Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc., which contained our former Industrial segment (Ingersoll Rand Industrial) through a pro rata distribution (the Distribution) to shareholders of record as of February 24, 2020. Ingersoll Rand Industrial then merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. Upon close of the Transaction, our existing shareholders received 50.1% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Gardner Denver stockholders retained 49.9% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand on a fully diluted basis. As a result, our shareholders received .8824 shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock with respect to each share owned as of February 24, 2020. In connection with the Transaction, we received a special cash payment of $1.9 billion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid Ingersoll Rand $49.5 million to settle certain items related to the Transaction. This payment was related to working capital, cash and indebtedness amounts as of the Distribution Date, as well as funding levels related to pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits. We recorded the settlement as a reduction to\nRetained earnings\nduring the first quarter of 2021.\nAfter the Distribution Date, we do not beneficially own any Ingersoll Rand Industrial shares of common stock and no longer consolidate Ingersoll Rand Industrial in our financial statements. The historical results of Ingersoll Rand Industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAsbestos-Related Matters\nOn June 18, 2020 (Petition Date), our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Aldrich and Murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina in Charlotte (the Bankruptcy Court). As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Inc. (200 Park), Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs LLC (ClimateLabs), Trane Technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries (the Trane Companies) are part of the Chapter 11 filings.\nThe goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures.\nOn September 24, 2021, Aldrich and Murray filed the plan of reorganization (the Plan) with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan is supported by, and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the court-appointed legal representative of future asbestos claimants (the FCR)\n.\nIn connection with the Plan\n,\nAldrich and Murray filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to create a $270.0 million trust intended to constitute a \"qualified settlement fund\" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code (QSF). The funds held in the QSF would be available to provide funding for the Section 524(g) Trust upon effectiveness of the Plan.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF. The QSF is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. At this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last. The Chapter 11 cases remain pending as of February 7, 2022.\nPrior to the Petition Date, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of our existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos.\nSee also the discussion under Part I, Item 3, \"Legal Proceedings,\" and in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n8\nHuman Capital Management\nOur people and culture are critical to achieving our operational, financial and strategic success.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we employed approximately 37,000 people in nearly 60 countries including approximately 13,000 outside of the United States. As of December 31, 2021, 25.5% of our global employees were women and 36.4% of our employees in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. In 2021, 29.2% of our new hires globally were women and 44.2% of new hires in the United States were racially and ethnically diverse. Approximately 23.1% of leadership and management positions were held by women as of December 31, 2021. The diversity amounts included in this section exclude current year business acquisitions.\nAs a result of maintaining a consistent focus on an uplifting culture, our key talent (high performing and high potential salaried employees) retention rate excluding retirements in 2021 was 94.6%. Our company‑wide (all employees) voluntary retention rate excluding retirements was 89.5%.\nCulture and Purpose\nIn 2021, we continued to execute on our purpose to\nboldly challenge what’s possible for a sustainable world\n. We are a diverse team of inventive, collaborative people who share a passion for making a difference and we believe our core Leadership Principles will help guide all employees to live our purpose.\nSince its launch in 2006, our annual employee engagement survey has enabled employees to share their experiences and perceptions of our Company. Employees provided ratings and written comments for continuous improvement. In 2021, 89% of our workforce participated in our annual engagement survey and our overall employee engagement score remains high reflecting our great commitment to the pride, energy and optimism of our employees.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nOur commitment to Diversity and Inclusion is core to our purpose and our 2030 Sustainability Commitments. We are proud members of Paradigm for Parity (a coalition of more than 100 corporations who have committed to closing the gender gap in corporate leadership) and OneTen (a coalition dedicated to hiring one million Black Americans in the next ten years to achieve economic mobility). In addition, we are a 2017 signatory, renewed by Dave Regnery in 2021, to the CEO Action for Diversity and Inclusion pledge (the largest CEO-driven business commitment to advance diversity and inclusion within the workplace).\nWe offer company-sponsored forums to promote diversity and inclusion in the workplace including:\n•\nBridging Connections – a safe forum created to allow our employees to speak from the heart about a variety of topics without fear of retribution.\n•\nEmployee Resources Groups (ERGs) – we sponsor eight ERGs (the Women's Employee Network, the Black Employee Network, the Veterans Employee Resource Group, the Asian Employee Resource Group, the Global Organization of Latinos, the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender and Allies (LGBTA) Employee Resource Group, the InterGenerational Employee Network, and Visibility). All ERGs are voluntary, open and inclusive organizations that offer employees a sense of belonging, networking and learning opportunities.\n•\nWomen’s Leadership Development Programs\n◦\nThe Women in Action Leadership Program is a virtual, self-paced cohort program that provides women with access to content that promotes their leadership development skills.\n◦\nThe Women on the Rise (WOR) program is designed over eight-weeks to help empower, develop, connect and support emerging women leaders.\n◦\nThe Women’s Leadership Program (WLP) is a cohort program for high potential talent that provides an opportunity to network with other senior women leaders, gain individual insights through an executive mentoring partnership and build leadership skills and confidence through a variety of learning components, speakers, experiences and assessments.\n•\nIn 2021, we launched The Elevate Series which encompasses the belonging and advancement of the racial and ethnically diverse leaders in our company. This is an extension of the Black Leader Forum in 2019 which was an intensive day and a half session bringing together company leaders to learn, deepen a sense of community and build upon our strategic intent to advance Black leaders.\n9\nLearning and Development\nWe offer learning and career development opportunities that enhance our employees’ skills and abilities and ensure contemporary technical and functional skills and competencies such as innovation, collaboration and leadership. Examples of these programs include:\n•\nTeam Leader Development Program – An eight-week experiential development program that engages, teaches and empowers front-line plant leaders to apply continuous improvement methods, make sound business decisions, solve problems, and serve as a coach of direct workers.\n•\nGraduate Training Program (GTP) – A five-month development program designed to prepare university graduate engineers for a rewarding career in technical sales. The program prepares sales engineers to sell Trane’s complex HVAC systems and energy services. The program, started in 1926, is recognized as the industry’s most comprehensive training program and provides intensive technical, business, sales, and leadership training. GTP accelerates careers and provides the skills needed to help us to seek to lower the energy intensity of the world.\n•\nAccelerated Development Program (ADP) – An early career rotational program focused on both functional and leadership development, designed to build a pipeline of strong talent for key roles in the organization. Participants rotate to multiple geographic locations and business units during the 2.5 year program, while completing diverse assignments, and receiving dedicated functional training and developmental experiences. Established in 1979, the ADP holds a rich history of developing early talent and spans six functions and four regions.\n•\nLeadership Development - We invest in custom, key transition leadership development programs for our high potential talent from immersive experiential leader acceleration labs to innovative global cohort programs. We partner with best-in-class external leadership development experts such as INSEAD, Center for Creative Leadership, and the NeuroLeadership Institute to deliver these programs globally each year. Additionally, we offer to our Trane Technologies people leaders learning programs to develop their skills in leading their teams, such as building diverse and inclusive teams, increasing engagement, and coaching skills.\n•\nProfessional development – We have numerous online courses in professional development skills as varied as working virtually, resiliency, Microsoft Teams, unconscious bias, effective communication, alert driving, sustainability, and strategic capability initiatives such as product management and other programs that support our strategy of being a world class lean enterprise.\n•\nCompliance Training – Our Compliance Training curriculum covers key topics that are important to protect our Company, our people and our customers. Topics include certification in our Code of Conduct, Information Security, Understanding and Preventing Sexual Harassment and Human Trafficking Prevention. All salaried employees globally complete our annual compliance curriculum.\nEmployee Volunteerism\nIn 2021, due to the ongoing challenges connected to the COVID-19 global pandemic, our employees sought out creative alternatives to in-person volunteering, including coordinated virtual volunteering events, and digital mentoring. One of the year’s highlights was our support of a dynamic multi-state exhibition called Creators Wanted, that introduced thousands of junior and senior high school students in multiple U.S. states to the rewarding career pathways available in manufacturing. Our teams volunteered hundreds of hours, partnering with the National Association of Manufacturers, producing a unique and lasting experience.\nLast year, we introduced a new Global Volunteer Time program to support salaried employees with a full eight-hour workday per calendar year to volunteer their time with eligible non-profit organizations. This program was made available for hourly employees at select locations. Through the Volunteer Time Off program and individual acts of volunteerism, our generous employees around the world contributed more than 10,000 hours of volunteerism in 2021. Our support for those in need also included our own colleagues support for one another. Due to the continued impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, and an unforeseen weather event in our plant in Tyler, Texas, Trane Technologies employees and the Trane Technologies Foundation donated grants to employees facing extraordinary hardship through our Helping Hand Fund. These grants totaled approximately $0.6 million, providing approximately 400 employees with critical support for themselves and their families.\n10\nHealth, Safety and Well-Being\nTrane Technologies believes in supporting the total health and safety of our employees. It is even more critical given the impact of COVID-19, and we continue to provide expanded support by:\n•\nProviding 100% of our employees around the world access to at least one company-sponsored wellness activity, including implementing a holistic wellness engagement platform globally to support personal needs of employees and to provide mental health support resources.\n•\nInitiating a global workstream to assess mental health, to identify areas of concerns and to implement programs and provide resources to support individuals’ mental health needs. Global ERGs sponsored mental health education sessions, which included raising awareness of mental health risks and patient health questionnaire (PHQ) assessment methods. Through our global Employee Assistance Program, employees received frequent communications on resources, targeted to crisis concerns such as mental health, childcare, and education.\n•\nAccelerating our “Future of Work” initiative to create revised Flex Time and Flex Place policies and resources that vary by type of role, continued work-from-home arrangements, and other approaches to ensuring productivity while being supportive to employee needs.\n•\nProviding global employees with up to 4 hours of paid time off per vaccine or booster dose to support and encourage all employees to be fully vaccinated for COVID-19.\n•\nFacilitating the delivery of critical medical resources, including oxygen, to support employees in locations where essential supplies were in shortage.\nIn 2021 we continued our multi-year, world class safety record with a Lost-time Incident Rate below 0.10 and Recordable Rate below 1.00. In response to the pandemic, we continue to monitor, track and implement COVID-19 guidance based on World Health Organization (WHO), Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and other local or country specific guidelines. We internally track the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases and keep close contact with those who quarantine. We compare these numbers to local community infection rates where available. In our factories, we reconfigured over 5,000 workstations to meet the social distancing guidelines. We also completed over 40,000 observations of our service technicians and manufacturing employees to ensure all employees were following our COVID-19 protocols.\nCompetitive Pay and Benefits\nTrane Technologies’ compensation programs and policies are designed to align the compensation of our employees with the Company’s performance and strategy: to attract and retain a talented workforce and to meet the needs of employees globally. We are committed to providing competitive and equitable wages and benefits that will allow our employees to thrive at work and at home. In addition, the structure of our compensation programs balances incentive earnings for both long-term and short-term performance, with our annual incentive plan closely tied to our 2030 sustainability commitments, which includes environmental sustainability and workforce diversity goals, in addition to financial goals.\nTrane Technologies’ benefits programs and policies are designed to support the wellbeing of employees so they can thrive at work and at home. Purpose-driven and locally relevant benefits programs are provided globally. In addition to core and competitive medical, welfare and retirement programs, benefit offerings include programs to support work-life balance, including:\n•\nExpanded family support programs inclusive of child and elder back-up care programs;\n•\nEnhanced parental leave programs; and\n•\nTuition reimbursement to support the ongoing growth and development of our employees.\nOur proxy statement provides more detail on the competitive compensation and benefit programs we offer.\nAvailable Information\nWe have used, and intend to continue to use, the homepage, the investor relations and the “News” section of our website (www.tranetechnologies.com), among other sources such as press releases, public conference calls and webcasts, as a means of disclosing additional information, which may include future developments regarding the Company and/or material non-public information. We encourage investors, the media, and others interested in our Company to review the information it makes public in these locations on its website.\nWe file annual, quarterly, and current reports, proxy statements, and other documents with the Securities and Exchange Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n11\nThis Annual Report on Form 10-K, as well as our quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K and any amendments to all of the foregoing reports, are made available free of charge on our Internet website (www.tranetechnologies.com) as soon as reasonably practicable after such reports are electronically filed with or furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The Board of Directors of our Company have also adopted and posted in the Investor Relations section of our website the Corporate Governance Guidelines and charters for each of the Board’s standing committees. The contents of our website are not incorporated by reference in this report.\nExecutive Officers of the Registrant\nThe following is a list of our executive officers as of February 7, 2022.\nNo family relationship exists between any of the above-listed executive officers of our Company. All officers are elected to hold office for one year or until their successors are elected and qualified. Ms. Avedon has announced her intention to retire in April 2022.\n12"

    "text": "Our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows are subject to a number of risks that could cause the actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements contained in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The risks set forth below are those we consider most significant. We face other risks, however, that we do not currently perceive to be material which could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from our expectations. You should evaluate all risks before you invest in our securities. If any of the risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, results of operations or cash flows could be adversely impacted. In that case, the trading price of our ordinary shares could decline, and you may lose all or part of your investment.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted our business and could have a more material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe continue to closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic on all aspects of our business and geographies, including how it has and will impact our customers, team members, suppliers, vendors, business partners and distribution channels. The COVID-19 global pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which may continue to affect our business operations and may materially and adversely affect our results of operations, cash flows and financial position.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic has caused certain disruptions to and shutdowns of our business and operations and could cause material disruptions to and shutdowns of our business and operations in the future as a result of, among other things, quarantines, worker absenteeism as a result of illness or other factors, social distancing measures and other travel, health-related, business or other restrictions. These effects of the pandemic have created and exacerbated issues concerning the attraction and retention of talent globally. Our business and operations have been impacted globally, resulting in lower revenues for some quarters, supply chain delays and unfavorable foreign currency exchange rate movements from time to time. The COVID-19 global pandemic has also adversely impacted, and may continue to adversely impact, our suppliers and their manufacturers and our customers. Some of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness, uniqueness of design, or product quality. The effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic have exacerbated supply chain issues with these suppliers. Any delay in receiving critical supplies could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nAs a result of the effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic, our costs have increased (including the costs to address the health and safety of our employees), our ability to obtain products or services from suppliers has been and may be adversely impacted, and our ability to operate at certain locations has been and may be impacted, and, as a result, our business, financial condition and results of operations have been adversely impacted and could be materially adversely affected if the COVID-19 global pandemic continues or there are resurgences of COVID-19 and its variants.\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic also resulted in severe disruptions and volatility in financial markets which had a material adverse impact on some of our customers and suppliers. A recurrence in volatility due to a resurgence in the COVID-19 global pandemic could impact our access to capital and credit markets. Notwithstanding the introduction of vaccines to combat the COVID-19 global pandemic and measures taken by governments to provide economic stimulus, the severity of the pandemic’s impact on economies in the United States and around the world, the potential length of the economic recovery and the longer-term economic impacts are uncertain. The current and potential further outbreaks and spread of the COVID-19 global pandemic or other future pandemics could cause a delayed recovery, a prolonged recession or future economic disruptions, which could have a further adverse impact on our financial condition and operations.\nVaccine mandates and testing requirements have been announced in jurisdictions where we operate. Our efforts to comply with these requirements could result in attrition and could impact our ability to successfully compete for talent, our ability to operate our manufacturing facilities and our ability to service our customers. In addition, compliance and monitoring costs associated with these mandates could be significant.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 global pandemic may also exacerbate other risks discussed in Item 1A. Risk Factors in our Annual Report on Form 10-K, any of which could have a material effect on us. This situation is continuing to evolve rapidly and additional impacts may arise that we are not aware of currently.\n13\nOur global operations subject us to economic risks.\nOur global operations are dependent upon products manufactured, purchased and sold in the U.S. and internationally. These activities are subject to risks that are inherent in operating globally, including:\n•\nchanges in local laws and regulations including potential imposition of currency restrictions, new or changing tax laws and other restraints;\n•\nlimitation of ownership rights, including expropriation of assets by a local government, and limitation on the ability to repatriate earnings;\n•\nsovereign debt crises and currency instability in developed and developing countries;\n•\ntrade protection measures such as import or export restrictions and requirements, the imposition of burdensome tariffs and quotas or revocation or material modification of trade agreements;\n•\ndifficulty in staffing and managing global operations including supply chain disruptions which may be exacerbated by pandemics or other events affecting the supply of labor, materials and components;\n•\ndifficulty of enforcing agreements, collecting receivables and protecting assets through non-U.S. legal systems;\n•\nnational and international conflict, including war, civil disturbances and terrorist acts; and\n•\nrecessions, economic downturns, price instability, slowing economic growth and social and political instability.\nThese risks could increase our cost of doing business internationally, increase our counterparty risk, disrupt our operations, disrupt the ability of suppliers and customers to fulfill their obligations, limit our ability to sell products in certain markets and have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nCommodity shortages, supply chain risks and price increases could adversely affect our financial results.\nWe rely on suppliers to secure commodities, particularly steel and non-ferrous metals, and third-party parts and components required for the manufacture of our products. A disruption in deliveries from our suppliers or decreased availability of commodities and third-party parts and components could have an adverse effect on our ability to meet our commitments to customers or increase our operating costs. Disruptions have occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic, capacity constraints, labor shortages, port congestion, logistical problems and other issues. Some of these disruptions have resulted in supply chain constraints affecting our business including our ability to timely produce and ship our products. The unavailability of some commodities and third-party parts and components could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows.\nVolatility in the prices of commodities and third-party parts and components or the impact of inflationary increases could increase the costs of our products and services. We may not be able to pass on these costs to our customers and this could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows. Conversely, in the event there is deflation, we may experience pressure from our customers to reduce prices. There can be no assurance that we would be able to reduce our costs (through negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows. While we may use financial derivatives or supplier price locks to hedge against this volatility, by using these instruments we may potentially forego the benefits that might result from favorable fluctuations in prices and could experience lower margins in periods of declining commodity prices. In addition, while hedging activity may minimize near-term volatility of the commodity prices, it would not protect us from long-term commodity price increases.\nSome of our purchases are from sole or limited source suppliers for reasons of cost effectiveness, uniqueness of design, or product quality. If these suppliers encounter financial or operating difficulties, we might not be able to quickly establish or qualify replacement sources of supply.\nWe face significant competition in the markets that we serve.\nThe markets that we serve are highly competitive. We compete worldwide with a number of other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products. There has been consolidation and new entrants (including non-traditional competitors) within our industries and there may be future consolidation and new entrants which could result in increased competition and significantly alter the dynamics of the competitive landscape in which we operate. Due to our global footprint we are competing worldwide with large companies and with smaller, local operators who may have customer, regulatory or economic advantages in the geographies in which they are located. In addition, some of our competitors may employ pricing and other strategies that are not traditional. While we understand our markets and competitive landscape, there is always the risk of disruptive technologies coming from companies that are not traditionally manufacturers or service providers of our products.\n14\nOur growth is dependent, in part, on the timely development, commercialization and acceptance of new and enhanced products and services.\nWe must timely develop and commercialize new and enhanced products and services in a rapidly changing technological and business environment in order to remain competitive in our current and future markets and in order to continue to grow our business. The development and commercialization of new products and the modification of existing products and services to meet customer demands require a significant investment of resources and an anticipation of the impact of new technologies and the ability to compete with others who may have superior resources in specific technology domains. We cannot provide any assurance that any new or enhanced product or service will be successfully commercialized in a timely manner, if ever, or, if commercialized, will result in returns greater than our investment. Investment in a product or service could divert our attention and resources from other projects that become more commercially viable in the market. We also cannot provide any assurance that any new or enhanced product or service will be accepted by our current and future markets. Failure to timely develop new and enhanced products and services that are accepted by these markets could have a material adverse impact on our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe capital and credit markets are important to our business.\nInstability in U.S. and global capital and credit markets, including market disruptions, limited liquidity and interest rate volatility, or reductions in the credit ratings assigned to us by independent rating agencies could reduce our access to capital markets or increase the cost of funding our short and long term credit requirements. In particular, if we are unable to access capital and credit markets on terms that are acceptable to us, we may not be able to make certain investments or fully execute our business plans and strategies.\nOur suppliers and customers are also dependent upon the capital and credit markets. Limitations on the ability of customers, suppliers or financial counterparties to access credit at interest rates and on terms that are acceptable to them could lead to insolvencies of key suppliers and customers, limit or prevent customers from obtaining credit to finance purchases of our products and services and cause delays in the delivery of key products from suppliers.\nCurrency exchange rate fluctuations and other related risks may adversely affect our results.\nWe are exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in currency exchange rates. See Part II Item 7A, \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\"\nWe have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets. As a result, we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world.\nMany of our non-U.S. operations have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, and their results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Therefore, our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the respective foreign currency.\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset. The instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools, and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the risk of counter party non-performance, derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments.\nWe also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into U.S. dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or businesses located in or conducted within a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations result in a diminished value of funds denominated in the currency of the country instituting the devaluation.\n15\nRisks Related to Litigation\nMaterial adverse legal judgments, fines, penalties or settlements could adversely affect our results of operations or financial condition.\nWe are currently and may in the future become involved in legal proceedings and disputes incidental to the operation of our business or the business operations of previously-owned entities. Our business may be adversely affected by the outcome of these proceedings and other contingencies (including, without limitation, contract claims or other commercial disputes, product liability, product defects and asbestos-related matters) that cannot be predicted with certainty. Moreover, any insurance or indemnification rights that we may have may be insufficient or unavailable to protect us against the total aggregate amount of losses sustained as a result of such proceedings and contingencies. As required by generally accepted accounting principles in the United States, we establish reserves based on our assessment of contingencies. Subsequent developments in legal proceedings and other events could affect our assessment and estimates of the loss contingency recorded as a reserve and we may be required to make additional material payments, which could have a material adverse impact on our liquidity, results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\nThe Aldrich and Murray Chapter 11 cases involve various risks and uncertainties that could have a material effect on us.\nOn June 18, 2020, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries Aldrich and Murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code in the Bankruptcy Court. The goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures. Such a resolution, if achieved, would likely include a channeling injunction to enjoin asbestos claims resolved in the Chapter 11 cases from being filed or pursued against us or our affiliates. The Chapter 11 cases remain pending as of February 7, 2022.\nCertain of our subsidiaries have entered into funding agreements with Aldrich and Murray (collectively the Funding Agreements), pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated, among other things, to fund the costs and expenses of Aldrich and Murray during the pendency of the Chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent that the other assets of Aldrich and Murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding.\nOn August 26, 2021, we announced that Aldrich and Murray reached an agreement in principle with the court appointed legal representative of the FCR in the bankruptcy proceedings. The agreement in principle includes the key terms for the permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against Aldrich and Murray (Asbestos Claims) pursuant to the Plan as described further in Note 21, “Commitments and Contingencies” and “Item 1- Legal Proceedings” in this report. The agreement in principle with the FCR is subject to final documentation and is conditioned on arrangements acceptable to Aldrich and Murray with respect to their asbestos insurance assets. The current asbestos claimants (the ACC) are not a party to the agreement in principle. Any settlement and its implementation in a plan of reorganization is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will approve the agreement on the terms proposed.\nOn September 24, 2021, Aldrich and Murray filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan is supported by and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the FCR. In connection with the Plan, Aldrich and Murray filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to create a $270.0 million trust intended to constitute a QSF. The funds held in the QSF would be available to provide funding for the Section 524(g) Trust upon effectiveness of the Plan.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF. The QSF is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. At this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last.\nThere are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with these Chapter 11 cases, including, among others, those related to:\n•\nthe ultimate determination of the asbestos liability of Aldrich and Murray to be satisfied under a Chapter 11 plan and the ability to consummate the settlement reached with the FCR;\n•\nthe outcome of negotiations with the ACC and the FCR and other participants in the Chapter 11 cases, including insurers, concerning, among other things, the size and structure of a potential section 524(g) trust to pay the asbestos liability of Aldrich and Murray and the means for funding that trust;\n•\nthe actions of representatives of the asbestos claimants, including the ACC's pursuit of certain causes of action against us, following the Bankruptcy Court's grant of the ACC's motion seeking standing to investigate and pursue\n16\ncertain causes of action at a hearing held on January 27, 2022, and other potential actions by the ACC in opposition to, or otherwise inconsistent with, the efforts by Aldrich and Murray to diligently prosecute the Chapter 11 cases and ultimately seek Bankruptcy Court approval of a plan of reorganization;\n•\nthe decisions of the Bankruptcy Court relating to numerous substantive and procedural aspects of the Chapter 11 cases, including in connection with a proceeding by Aldrich and Murray to estimate their aggregate liability for asbestos claims, following the Bankruptcy Court's grant of their motion seeking such a proceeding at a hearing held on January 27, 2022, and other efforts by Aldrich and Murray to diligently prosecute the Chapter 11 cases and ultimately seek Bankruptcy Court approval of a plan of reorganization, whether such decisions are in response to actions of representatives of the asbestos claimants or otherwise;\n•\nthe risk that Aldrich and Murray may be unable to obtain the necessary approvals of the Bankruptcy Court or the United States District Court for the Western District of North Carolina (the District Court) of a plan of reorganization;\n•\nthe risk that any orders approving a plan of reorganization and issuing the channeling injunction do not become final;\n•\nthe terms and conditions of any plan of reorganization that is ultimately confirmed in the Chapter 11 cases;\n•\ndelays in the confirmation or effective date of a plan of reorganization or the funding of the QSF due to factors beyond the Company’s control;\n•\nthe risk that the ultimate amount required under any final plan of reorganization may exceed the amounts agreed to with the FCR in the Plan;\n•\nthe risk that the insurance carriers do not support the Plan, the risk that the ACC objects to the Plan and/or the motion to establish the QSF; and\n•\nthe decisions of appellate courts regarding approval of a plan of reorganization or relating to orders of the Bankruptcy Court or the District Court that may be appealed.\nThe ability of Aldrich and Murray to successfully reorganize and resolve their asbestos liabilities will depend on various factors, including their ability to reach agreements with representatives of the asbestos claimants on the terms of a plan of reorganization that satisfies all applicable legal requirements and to obtain the requisite court approvals of such plan, and remains subject to the risks and uncertainties described above. We cannot ensure that Aldrich and Murray can successfully reorganize, nor can we give any assurances as to the amount of the ultimate obligations under the Funding Agreements or any plan of reorganization, or the resulting impact on our financial condition, results of operations or future prospects. We also are unable to predict the timing of any of the foregoing matters or the timing for a resolution of the Chapter 11 cases, all of which could have an impact on us.\nIt also is possible that, in the Chapter 11 cases, various parties will seek to bring and will be successful in bringing claims against us and other related parties, including by raising allegations that we are liable for the asbestos-related liabilities of Aldrich and Murray as set forth in certain pleadings filed by the ACC in the Chapter 11 cases. Although we believe we have no such responsibility for liabilities of Aldrich and Murray, except indirectly through our obligation to provide funding to Aldrich and Murray under the terms of the Funding Agreements, we cannot provide assurances that such claims will not be pursued.\nIn sum, the outcome of the Chapter 11 cases is uncertain and there is uncertainty as to what extent we may have to contribute to a section 524(g) trust under the Funding Agreements.\nRisks Related to Cybersecurity and Technology\nWe are subject to risks relating to our information technology systems.\nWe rely extensively on information technology systems, some of which are supported by third party vendors including cloud-based systems and managed service providers, to manage and operate our business. We invest in new information technology systems designed to improve our operations. We have had failures of these systems in the past and may have failures of these systems in the future. If these systems cease to function properly, if these systems experience security breaches or disruptions or if these systems do not provide the anticipated benefits, our ability to manage our operations could be impaired, which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, and cash flows.\n17\nSecurity breaches or disruptions of the technology systems, infrastructure or products of the Company or our vendors could negatively impact our business and financial results.\nOur information technology systems, networks and infrastructure and technology embedded in certain of our control products have been and are vulnerable to cyber attacks and unauthorized security intrusions. From time to time, vulnerabilities in our products are discovered and updates are made available, but customers are vulnerable until those updates are applied or other mitigating actions are taken by customers to protect their systems and networks. Like other large companies, certain of our information technology systems and the systems of our vendors have been subject to computer viruses, malicious code, unauthorized access, phishing attempts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber attacks and we expect that we and our vendors will be subject to similar attacks in the future. For example, in the fourth quarter of 2021 a third-party provider that we use for time and attendance tracking experienced a ransomware event that affected our access to this software solution. We activated our crisis management team and business continuity processes and were able to employ alternate methods for tracking time and attendance. While the issue did not directly affect our operations or IT systems, the issue caused and continues to cause disruption and a reallocation of management’s time and attention to address the problem.\nThe methods used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service, or sabotage information technology systems are constantly changing and evolving. Despite having instituted security policies and business continuity plans, and implementing and regularly reviewing and updating processes and procedures to protect against unauthorized access and requiring similar protections from our vendors, the ever-evolving threats mean we are continually evaluating and adapting our systems and processes and ask our vendors to do the same, and there is no guarantee that such systems and processes will be adequate to safeguard against all data security breaches or misuses of data. Hardware, software or applications we develop or obtain from third parties sometimes contain defects in design or deployment or other problems that could unexpectedly result in security breaches or disruptions. Open source software components embedded into certain software that we use has in the past contained vulnerabilities and others may be discovered in the future. Such vulnerabilities can expose our systems to malware or allow third party access to data. While these issues are not specific to our Company, we are required to take action when such vulnerabilities are identified including patching and modification to certain of our products and enterprise systems. To date, there has been no material business impact from such vulnerabilities, but we continue to monitor these issues and our responses are ongoing. Our systems, networks and certain of our control products and those of our vendors are vulnerable to system damage, malicious attacks from hackers, employee errors or misconduct, viruses, power and utility outages, and other catastrophic events. Any of these incidents could cause significant harm to our business by negatively impacting our business operations, compromising the security of our proprietary information or the personally identifiable information of our customers, employees and business partners, exposing us to litigation or other legal actions against us or the imposition of penalties, fines, fees or liabilities. Such events could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition and cash flows and could damage our reputation which could adversely affect our business. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs related to a cybersecurity attack or disruptions resulting from such attacks. Customers are increasingly requiring cybersecurity protections and mandating cybersecurity standards in our products, and we may incur additional costs to comply with such demands.\nData privacy and protection laws are evolving and present increasing compliance challenges.\nThe regulatory environment surrounding data privacy and protection is increasingly demanding, with the frequent imposition of new and changing requirements across businesses and geographic areas. We are required to comply with complex regulations when collecting, transferring and using personal data, which increases our costs, affects our competitiveness and can expose us to substantial fines or other penalties.\nIntellectual property infringement claims of others and the inability to protect our intellectual property rights could harm our competitive position.\nOur intellectual property (IP) rights are important to our business and include numerous patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, proprietary technology, technical data, business processes, and other confidential information. Although in aggregate we consider our intellectual property rights to be valuable to our operations, we do not believe that our business is materially dependent on a single intellectual property right or any group of them. In our opinion, engineering, production skills and experience are more responsible for our market position than our patents and/or licenses.\nNonetheless, this intellectual property may be subject to challenge, infringement, invalidation or circumvention by third parties. Despite extensive security measures, our intellectual property may be subject to misappropriation through unauthorized access of our information technology systems, employee theft, or theft by private parties or foreign actors, including those affiliated with or controlled by state actors. Our business and competitive position could be harmed by such events. Our ability to protect our intellectual property rights by legal recourse or otherwise may be limited, particularly in countries where laws or enforcement practices are inadequate or undeveloped. Our inability to enforce our IP rights under any of these circumstances could have an impact on our competitive position and business.\n18\nRisks Related to Regulatory Matters\nOur reputation, ability to do business and results of operations could be impaired by improper conduct by any of our employees, agents or business partners.\nWe are subject to regulation under a wide variety of U.S. federal and state and non-U.S. laws, regulations and policies, including laws related to anti-corruption, anti-human trafficking, anti-bribery, export and import compliance, anti-trust and money laundering, due to our global operations. We cannot provide assurance our internal controls will always protect us from the improper conduct of our employees, agents and business partners. Any violations of law or improper conduct could damage our reputation and, depending on the circumstances, subject us to, among other things, civil and criminal penalties, material fines, equitable remedies (including profit disgorgement and injunctions on future conduct), securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence, any one of which could have a material adverse impact on our business prospects, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the market value of our stock.\nOur operations are subject to regulatory risks.\nOur U.S. and non-U.S. operations are subject to a number of laws and regulations, including among others, laws related to the environment and health and safety. We have made, and will be required to continue to make, significant expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations. Any violations of applicable laws and regulations could lead to significant penalties, fines or other sanctions. Changes in current laws and regulations could require us to increase our compliance expenditures, cause us to significantly alter or discontinue offering existing products and services or cause us to develop new products and services. Altering current products and services or developing new products and services to comply with changes in the applicable laws and regulations could require significant research and development investments, increase the cost of providing the products and services and adversely affect the demand for our products and services. The U.S. federal government and various states and municipalities have enacted or may enact legislation intended to deny government contracts to U.S. companies that reincorporate outside of the U.S. or have reincorporated outside of the U.S or may take other actions negatively impacting such companies. If we are unable to effectively respond to changes to applicable laws and regulations, interpretations of applicable laws and regulations, or comply with existing and future laws and regulations, our competitive position, results of operations, financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely impacted.\nGlobal climate change and related regulations could negatively affect our business.\nClimate change presents immediate and long-term risks to our Company and to our customers, with the risks expected to increase over time. Our products and operations are subject to and affected by environmental regulation by federal, state and local authorities in the U.S. and regulatory authorities with jurisdiction over our international operations, including with respect to the use, storage, and dependence upon refrigerants which are considered greenhouse gases. Refrigerants are essential to many of our products and there is concern regarding the global warming potential of such materials. As such, national, regional and international regulations and policies are being implemented to curtail their use. Some of these regulations could have a negative competitive impact on our company by requiring us to make costly changes to our products. As regulations reduce the use of the current class of widely used refrigerants, we are developing and selling our next generation products that utilize  lower global warming potential solutions. There can be no assurance that climate change or environmental regulation or deregulation will not have a negative competitive impact on our ability to sell these products or that economic returns will match the investment that we are making in new product development. We face increasing complexity related to product design, the use of regulated materials, the associated energy consumption and efficiency related to the use of products, the transportation and shipping of products, climate change regulations, and the reuse, recycling and/or disposal of products and their components at end-of-use or useful life as we adjust to new and future requirements relating to our transition to a more circular economy. There continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Such regulatory uncertainty extends to future incentives for energy efficient buildings and vehicles and costs of compliance, which may impact the demand for our products, obsolescence of our products and our results of operations.\nOur climate commitment requires us to offer a full line of next generation products by 2030 without compromising safety or energy efficiency. Additionally, in 2019, we announced our 2030 commitment which targets reducing one gigaton – one billion metric tons – of carbon emissions (CO2e) from our customers’ footprint by 2030. While we are committed to pursuing these sustainability objectives, there can be no assurance that we will successfully achieve our commitments. Failure to meet these commitments could result in reputational harm to our company. Changes regarding climate risk management and practices may result in higher regulatory, compliance risks and costs.\n19\nRisks Related to Our Business Operations\nOur business strategy includes acquiring businesses, product lines, technologies and capabilities, plants and other assets, entering into joint ventures and making investments that complement our existing businesses. We also occasionally divest businesses that we own. We may not identify acquisition or joint venture candidates or investment opportunities at the same rate as the past. Acquisitions, dispositions, joint ventures and investments that we identify could be unsuccessful or consume significant resources, which could adversely affect our operating results.\nWe continue to analyze and evaluate the acquisition and divestiture of strategic businesses and product lines, technologies and capabilities, plants and other assets, joint ventures and investments with the potential to, among other things, strengthen our industry position, to enhance our existing set of product and services offerings, to increase productivity and efficiencies, to grow revenues, earnings and cash flow, to help us stay competitive or to reduce costs. There can be no assurance that we will identify or successfully complete transactions with suitable candidates in the future, that we will consummate these transactions at rates similar to the past or that completed transactions will be successful. Strategic transactions may involve significant cash expenditures, debt incurrence, operating losses and expenses that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. Such transactions involve numerous other risks, including:\n•\ndiversion of management time and attention from daily operations;\n•\ndifficulties integrating acquired businesses, technologies and personnel into our business, including doing so without high costs;\n•\ndifficulties in obtaining and verifying the financial statements and other business and other due diligence information of acquired businesses;\n•\ninability to obtain required regulatory approvals and/or required financing on favorable terms;\n•\npotential loss of key employees, key contractual relationships or key customers of either acquired businesses or our business;\n•\nassumption of the liabilities and exposure to unforeseen or undisclosed liabilities of acquired businesses and exposure to regulatory sanctions;\n•\ninheriting internal control deficiencies;\n•\ndilution of interests of holders of our common shares through the issuance of equity securities or equity-linked securities; and\n•\nin the case of joint ventures and other investments, interests that diverge from those of our partners without the ability to direct the management and operations of the joint venture or investment in the manner we believe most appropriate to achieve the expected value.\nAny acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures or investments may ultimately harm our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. There are additional risks related to our Reverse Morris Trust transaction, see \"Risks Related to the Transactions\" for more information.\nNatural disasters, epidemics or other unexpected events may disrupt our operations, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and may not be fully covered by insurance.\nThe occurrence of one or more catastrophic events including hurricanes, fires, earthquakes, floods and other forms of severe weather, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other catastrophic events in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate or are located could adversely affect our operations and financial performance. Natural disasters, power outages, health epidemics or pandemics or other contagious outbreaks or other unexpected events could result in physical damage to and complete or partial closure of one or more of our plants, temporary or long-term disruption of our operations by causing business interruptions, material scarcity, price volatility or supply chain disruptions. Climate change is a risk multiplier with respect to these physical disasters in both frequency and severity and may affect our global business operations as a result. Existing insurance arrangements may not provide full protection for the costs that may arise from such events, particularly if such events are catastrophic in nature or occur in combination. The occurrence of any of these events could increase our insurance and other operating costs or harm our sales in affected areas.\n20\nOur business may be adversely affected by temporary work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force.\nCertain of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements or works councils. We experience from time-to-time temporary work stoppages, union negotiations, labor disputes and other matters associated with our labor force and some of these events could result in significant increases in our cost of labor, impact our productivity or damage our reputation. Additionally, a work stoppage at one of our suppliers could materially and adversely affect our operations if an alternative source of supply were not readily available. Stoppages by employees of our customers could also result in reduced demand for our products. Some of these issues have been and may in the future be exacerbated by effects of the COVID-19 global pandemic as described in our risk factor - \"\nThe COVID-19 global pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have already adversely impacted our business and could have a more material adverse impact on our business, financial condition and results of operations\n\".\nRisks Relating to Tax Matters\nChanges in tax or other laws, regulations or treaties, changes in our status under U.S. or non-U.S. laws or adverse determinations by taxing or other governmental authorities could increase our tax burden or otherwise affect our financial condition or operating results, as well as subject our shareholders to additional taxes.\nThe taxes associated with our operations and corporate structure could be impacted by changes in tax or other laws, treaties or regulations or the interpretation or enforcement thereof by the U.S. or non-U.S. tax or other governmental authorities.  While the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) was passed in the U.S. in 2017, further guidance, regulations, and technical corrections pertaining to TCJA continue to be issued by the tax authorities, some of which may have retroactive application. We continue to monitor and review new guidance and regulations as they are issued, as any changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements.  In addition, the U.S. Congress is actively engaged in formulating new legislative proposals. Any future legislative changes to the tax laws and judicial or regulatory interpretation thereof, the geographic mix of earnings, changes in overall profitability, and other factors could also materially impact our effective tax rate.\nWe continue to monitor for other tax changes, U.S. (including state and local) and non-U.S. related, which can also adversely impact our overall tax burden. From time to time, proposals have been made and/or legislation has been introduced to change the tax laws, regulations or interpretations thereof of various jurisdictions or limit tax treaty benefits that if enacted or implemented could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations. Moreover, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) has released proposals to create an agreed set of international rules for fighting base erosion and profit shifting, including Pillar One and Pillar Two, such that tax laws in countries in which we do business could change on a prospective or retroactive basis, and any such changes could adversely impact us. The OECD (and the European Commission) have also committed to implementing a global minimum tax rate (proposed 15% minimum tax rate, agreed upon by over 135 jurisdictions, including Ireland). Full details are uncertain and timing is currently proposed to be January 1, 2023. As a consequence, our global effective tax rate could be materially impacted by such legislation, or any resulting local country legislation enacted in response to any potential global minimum tax rates.\nFinally, the European Commission has been very active in investigating whether various tax regimes or private tax rulings provided by a country to particular taxpayers may constitute State Aid. We cannot predict the outcome of any of these potential changes or investigations in any of the jurisdictions, but if any of the above occurs and impacts us, this could materially increase our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.\nWhile we monitor proposals and other developments that would materially impact our tax burden and/or effective tax rate and investigate our options, we could still be subject to increased taxation on a going forward basis no matter what action we undertake if certain legislative proposals or regulatory changes are enacted, certain tax treaties are amended and/or our interpretation of applicable tax or other laws is challenged and determined to be incorrect. In particular, any changes and/or differing interpretations of applicable tax law that have the effect of disregarding the shareholders' decision to reorganize in Ireland, limiting our ability to take advantage of tax treaties between jurisdictions, modifying or eliminating the deductibility of various currently deductible payments, or increasing the tax burden of operating or being resident in a particular country could subject us to increased taxation.\nIn addition, tax authorities periodically review tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. These examinations on their own, or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations, may result in additional taxes or penalties against us. If the ultimate result of these audits differs from our original or adjusted estimates, they could have a material impact on our tax provision.\n21\nRisks Related to our Reverse Morris Trust Transaction\nOn the Distribution Date, we completed the Transaction with Gardner Denver, which changed its name to Ingersoll Rand after the Transaction whereby we distributed Ingersoll-Rand U.S. Holdco, Inc., which contained Ingersoll Rand Industrial, through the Distribution to our shareholders of record as of February 24, 2020. Ingersoll Rand Industrial then merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. Upon close of the Transaction, our existing shareholders received approximately 50.1% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Gardner Denver stockholders retained approximately 49.9% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand on a fully diluted basis. As a result, our shareholders received 0.8824 shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock with respect to each share of our stock owned as of February 24, 2020. In connection with the Transaction, we received a special cash payment of $1.9 billion.\nIf the Distribution as part of our Reverse Morris Trust Transaction is determined to be taxable for Irish tax purposes, significant Irish tax liabilities may arise for our shareholders.\nWe received an opinion from Irish Revenue regarding certain tax matters associated with the Distribution, as well as a legal opinion from our Irish counsel Arthur Cox, regarding certain Irish tax consequences for shareholders of the Distribution. For our shareholders that are not resident or ordinarily resident in Ireland for Irish tax purposes and that do not hold their shares in connection with a trade or business carried on by such shareholders through an Irish branch or agency, we consider, based on both opinions taken together, that no adverse Irish tax consequences for such shareholders should have arisen. These opinions relied on certain facts and assumptions and certain representations. Notwithstanding the opinion from Irish Revenue, Irish Revenue could ultimately determine on audit that the Distribution is taxable for Irish tax purposes, for example, if it determines that any of these facts, assumptions or representations are not correct or have been violated. A legal opinion represents the tax adviser’s best legal judgment and is not binding on Irish Revenue or the courts and Irish Revenue or the courts may not agree with the legal opinion. In addition, the legal opinion is based on current law and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the Distribution ultimately is determined to be taxable for Irish tax purposes, certain of our shareholders and we could have significant Irish tax liabilities as a result of the Distribution, and there could be a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods.\nIf the Distribution together with certain related transactions do not qualify as tax-free under Sections 355 and 368(a) of the Code, including as a result of subsequent acquisitions of stock of the Company or Ingersoll Rand Inc., then the Company and our shareholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes, and Ingersoll Rand Inc. may be obligated to indemnify the Company for such taxes imposed on the Company.\nWe received an opinion from our U.S. tax counsel Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison LLP (Paul Weiss) substantially to the effect that, for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Distribution together with certain related transactions undertaken in anticipation of the Distribution and taking into account the merger of Ingersoll Rand Industrial with the wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand will qualify as a tax-free transaction under Sections 368(a), 361 and 355 of the Code, with the result that we and our shareholders will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes as a result of the spin-off. The opinion of our counsel was based on, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by Ingersoll Rand, Ingersoll Rand Industrial and the Company. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinion of counsel. An opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment, is not binding on the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the opinion will be based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the Distribution, and/or related internal transactions in anticipation of the Distribution ultimately are determined to be taxable, we could incur significant U.S. federal income tax liabilities, which could cause a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in future reporting periods, although if this determination resulted from certain actions taken by Ingersoll Rand Industrial or Ingersoll Rand Inc., Ingersoll Rand Inc. would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability pursuant to the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement.\n22\nThe Distribution will be taxable to the Company pursuant to Section 355(e) of the Code if there is a 50% or greater change in ownership of either the Company or Ingersoll Rand Industrial, directly or indirectly (including through such a change in ownership of Ingersoll Rand Inc.), as part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution. A Section 355(e) change of ownership would not make the Distribution taxable to our shareholders, but instead may result in corporate-level taxable gain to certain of our subsidiaries. Because our shareholders will collectively be treated as owning more than 50% of the Ingersoll Rand Inc. common stock following the merger, the merger alone should not cause the Distribution to be taxable to our subsidiaries under Section 355(e). However, Section 355(e) might apply if other acquisitions of stock of the Company before or after the merger, or of Ingersoll Rand Inc. before or after the merger, are considered to be part of a plan or series of related transactions that include the Distribution together with certain related transactions. If Section 355(e) applied, certain of our subsidiaries might recognize a very substantial amount of taxable gain, although if this applied as a result of certain actions taken by Ingersoll Rand Industrial, Ingersoll Rand Inc. or certain specified Ingersoll Rand Inc. stockholders, Ingersoll Rand Inc. would be required to bear the cost of any resultant tax liability under Section 355(e) pursuant to the terms of the Tax Matters Agreement.\nIf the merger does not qualify as a tax-free reorganization under Section 368(a) of the Code, our shareholders may be required to pay substantial U.S. federal income taxes.\nWe have received an opinion from Paul Weiss, and Ingersoll Rand Inc. has received an opinion from their counsel Simpson Thacher & Bartlett LLP, substantially to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of Section 368(a) of the Code with the result that U.S. holders of Ingersoll Rand Industrial common stock who received Ingersoll Rand common stock in the merger will not recognize any gain or loss for U.S. federal income tax purposes (except with respect to cash received in lieu of fractional shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock). These opinions were based upon, among other things, certain representations and assumptions as to factual matters made by Ingersoll Rand Inc., the Company, Ingersoll Rand Industrial and the merger subsidiary used by Ingersoll Rand Inc. The failure of any factual representation or assumption to be true, correct and complete in all material respects could adversely affect the validity of the opinions. An opinion of counsel represents counsel’s best legal judgment, is not binding on the IRS or the courts, and the IRS or the courts may not agree with the opinion. In addition, the opinions will be based on current law, and cannot be relied upon if current law changes with retroactive effect. If the merger were taxable, U.S. holders of Ingersoll Rand Industrial would be considered to have made a taxable sale of their Ingersoll Rand Industrial common stock to Ingersoll Rand Inc., and such U.S. holders of Ingersoll Rand Industrial would generally recognize taxable gain or loss on their receipt of Ingersoll Rand Inc. common stock in the merger.\nRisks Related to Our Irish Domicile\nIrish law differs from the laws in effect in the United States and may afford less protection to holders of our securities.\nThe United States currently does not have a treaty with Ireland providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments in civil and commercial matters. As such, there is some uncertainty as to whether the courts of Ireland would recognize or enforce judgments of U.S. courts obtained against us or our directors or officers based on U.S. federal or state civil liability laws, including the civil liability provisions of the U.S. federal or state securities laws, or hear actions against us or those persons based on those laws.\nAs an Irish company, we are governed by the Irish Companies Act, which differs in some material respects from laws generally applicable to U.S. corporations and shareholders, including, among others, differences relating to interested director and officer transactions, indemnification of directors and shareholder lawsuits. Likewise, the duties of directors and officers of an Irish company generally are owed to the company only. Shareholders of Irish companies generally do not have a personal right of action against directors or officers of the company and may exercise such rights of action on behalf of the company only in limited circumstances. Accordingly, holders of our securities may have more difficulty protecting their interests than would holders of securities of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction of the United States. In addition, Irish law does not allow for any form of legal proceedings directly equivalent to the class action available in the United States.\nIrish law allows shareholders to authorize share capital which then can be issued by a board of directors without shareholder approval. Also, subject to specified exceptions, Irish law grants statutory pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders to subscribe for new issuances of shares for cash but allows shareholders to authorize the waiver of the statutory pre-emptive rights with respect to any particular allotment of shares. Under Irish law, we must have authority from our shareholders to issue any shares, including shares that are part of the Company’s authorized but unissued share capital. In addition, unless otherwise authorized by its shareholders, when an Irish company issues shares for cash to new shareholders, it is required first to offer those shares on the same or more favorable terms to existing shareholders on a pro-rata basis. If we are unable to obtain these authorizations from our shareholders or are otherwise limited by the terms of our authorizations, our ability to issue shares or otherwise raise capital could be adversely affected.\n23\nDividends received by our shareholders may be subject to Irish dividend withholding tax.\nIn certain circumstances, we are required to deduct Irish dividend withholding tax (currently at the rate of 25%) from dividends paid to our shareholders. In the majority of cases, shareholders resident in the United States will not be subject to Irish withholding tax, and shareholders resident in a number of other countries will not be subject to Irish withholding tax provided that they complete certain Irish dividend withholding tax forms. However, some shareholders may be subject to withholding tax, which could have an adverse impact on the price of our shares.\nDividends received by our shareholders could be subject to Irish income tax.\nDividends paid in respect of our shares will generally not be subject to Irish income tax where the beneficial owner of these dividends is exempt from dividend withholding tax, unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Trane Technologies plc.\nOur shareholders who receive their dividends subject to Irish dividend withholding tax will generally have no further liability to Irish income tax on the dividends unless the beneficial owner of the dividend has some connection with Ireland other than his or her shareholding in Trane Technologies plc."

    "text": "In the normal course of business, we are involved in a variety of lawsuits, claims and legal proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray, commercial and contract disputes, employment matters, product liability and product defect claims, asbestos-related claims, environmental liabilities, intellectual property disputes, and tax-related matters. In our opinion, pending legal matters are not expected to have a material adverse impact on our results of operations, financial condition, liquidity or cash flows.\nAsbestos-Related Matters\nOn the Petition Date, Aldrich and Murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs, Trane Technologies plc nor the Trane Companies are part of the Chapter 11 filings.\nThe goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures. Such a resolution, if achieved, would likely include a channeling injunction to enjoin asbestos claims resolved in the Chapter 11 cases from being filed or pursued against us or our affiliates.\nOn August 26, 2021, we announced that Aldrich and Murray reached an agreement in principle with the FCR in the bankruptcy proceedings. The agreement includes the key terms for the permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against Aldrich and Murray pursuant to the Plan. Under the agreed terms, the Plan would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code and establish claims resolution procedures for the Asbestos Claims. On the effective date of the Plan, Aldrich and Murray would fund the trust with $545.0 million, comprised of $540.0 million in cash and a promissory note to be issued by Aldrich and Murray to the trust in the principal amount of $5.0 million, and the Asbestos Claims would be channeled to the trust for resolution in accordance with the claims resolution procedures. Following the effective date of the Plan, Aldrich and Murray, would have no further obligations with respect to the Asbestos Claims. The FCR has agreed to support such Plan. The agreement in principle with the FCR is subject to final documentation and is conditioned on arrangements acceptable to Aldrich and Murray with respect to their asbestos insurance assets. It is currently contemplated that the asbestos insurance assets of Aldrich and Murray would be contributed to the trust, and that, in consideration of their cash contribution to the trust, Aldrich and Murray would have the exclusive right to pursue, collect and retain all insurance reimbursements available in connection with the resolution of Asbestos Claims by the trust. The ACC is not a party to the agreement in principle. Any settlement and its implementation in a plan of reorganization is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will approve the agreement on the terms proposed.\nOn September 24, 2021, Aldrich and Murray filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan is supported by, and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the FCR\n.\nIn connection with the Plan\n,\nAldrich and Murray filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to create a $270.0 million trust intended to constitute a QSF. The funds held in the QSF would be available to provide funding for the Section 524(g) Trust upon effectiveness of the Plan.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF. The QSF is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. At this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last. The Chapter 11 cases remain pending as of February 7, 2022.\nPrior to the Petition Date, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of our existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos.\nSee also the discussion in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements."

    "text": "The following Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations contains forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties. Our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause a difference include, but are not limited to, those discussed under Item 1A. Risk Factors in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The following section is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information, including our financial statements and the notes thereto, which appears elsewhere in this Annual Report.\nThis section discusses 2021 and 2020 significant items affecting our consolidated operating results, financial condition and liquidity and provides a year-to-year comparison between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 significant items and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 have been excluded in this Form 10-K and can be found in \"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Part II, Item 7 of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for year ended December 31, 2020.\nOverview\nOrganizational\nTrane Technologies, plc, is a global climate innovator. We bring sustainable and efficient solutions to buildings, homes and transportation through our strategic brands, Trane\n®\nand Thermo King\n®\n, and our environmentally responsible portfolio of products, services and connected intelligent controls.\n2030 Sustainability Commitments\nOur commitment to sustainability extends to the environmental and social impacts of our people, operations, products and services. Our 2030 Sustainability Commitments have been verified by the SBTi and include our pledge to reduce customer greenhouse gas emissions by one gigaton (one billion metric tons). We are also ‘Leading by Example’ as we make progress toward carbon-neutral operations and zero waste-to-landfill across our global footprint and net positive water use in water-stressed locations. Our ‘Opportunity for All’ commitment focuses on gender parity in leadership, workforce diversity reflective of our communities, and a citizenship strategy that helps underserved communities through enhanced learning environments and pathways to green and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) careers.\nSeparation of Industrial Segment Business\nOn the Distribution Date, we completed the Transaction with Gardner Denver, which changed its name to Ingersoll Rand after the Transaction, whereby we distributed Ingersoll-Rand U.S. HoldCo, Inc., which contained Ingersoll Rand Industrial, through the Distribution to our shareholders of record as of February 24, 2020. Ingersoll Rand Industrial then merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. Upon close of the Transaction, our existing shareholders received 50.1% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Gardner Denver stockholders retained 49.9% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand on a fully diluted basis. As a result, our shareholders received .8824 shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock with respect to each share owned as of February 24, 2020. In connection with the Transaction, we received a special cash payment of $1.9 billion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we paid Ingersoll Rand $49.5 million to settle certain items related to the Transaction. This payment was related to working capital, cash and indebtedness amounts as of the Distribution Date, as well as funding levels related to pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits. We recorded the settlement as a reduction to\nRetained earnings\nduring the first quarter of 2021.\nAfter the Distribution Date, we do not beneficially own any Ingersoll Rand Industrial shares of common stock and no longer consolidate Ingersoll Rand Industrial in our financial statements. The historical results of Ingersoll Rand Industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\n28\nSignificant Events\nCOVID-19 Global Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic adversely impacted our business globally including, but not limited to, lower end customer demand, certain supply chain delays, temporary facility closures and limitations of our workforce to essential crews only. In response, we proactively initiated cost cutting actions and actively managed our supply chain in an effort to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic on our business. Despite the challenges set forth by the COVID-19 global pandemic, we continued to sell, install and service our products, invest in our businesses, develop and launch new products and deliver innovative customer solutions for electrification of heating, cooling and transport, enhanced indoor air quality, and precise temperature control along the full vaccine cold chain.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we experienced significant increases in end market demand, executed price increases to cover rapidly increasing material, component and logistics costs and realized strong earnings growth as a result of strong execution across our organization. In addition, to meet our increased customer demand, we are proactively managing industry-wide supply chain and resource constraints and are working closely with our suppliers, customers and logistics providers to mitigate the impacts on our business as we continue to sell, install and service our products.\nWe will continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic as it evolves and will assess any potential impacts to our business and financial statements as necessary.\nReorganization of Aldrich and Murray\nOn the Petition Date, our indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries, Aldrich and Murray each filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs, nor the Trane Companies are part of the Chapter 11 filings.\nThe goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures.\nAldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park and Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs were deconsolidated as of the Petition Date and their respective assets and liabilities were derecognized from our Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts derecognized in 2020 primarily related to the legacy asbestos-related liabilities and asbestos-related insurance recoveries and $41.7 million of cash.\nAs a result of the deconsolidation, we recognized an aggregate loss of $24.9 million in our Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2020. A gain of $0.9 million related to Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs was recorded within\nOther income/ (expense), net\nand a loss of $25.8 million related to Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park was recorded within\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\n. Additionally, the deconsolidation resulted in an investing cash outflow of $41.7 million in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, of which $10.8 million was recorded within continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the agreement in principle reached by Aldrich and Murray with the FCR and the motion to create a $270.0 million QSF, we recorded a charge of $21.2 million to increase our Funding Agreement liability to $270.0 million. The corresponding charge was bifurcated between\nOther income/ (expense), net\nof\n$7.2 million relating to Murray and discontinued operations of $14.0 million relating to Aldrich.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF, which is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. Therefore, as we expect to fund the QSF shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters the order reflecting its approval, we reclassified our $270.0 million Funding Agreement liability to\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nat December 31, 2021\n.\nAt this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last. The Chapter 11 cases remain pending as of February 7, 2022.\nSee also the discussion in Note 21 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n29\nTrends and Economic Events\nWe are a global corporation with worldwide operations. As a global business, our operations are affected by worldwide, regional and industry-specific economic factors as well as political and social factors wherever we operate or do business. Our geographic diversity and the breadth of our product and services portfolios have helped mitigate the impact of any one industry or the economy of any single country on our consolidated operating results.\nGiven our broad range of products manufactured and geographic markets served, management uses a variety of factors to predict the outlook for our company. We monitor key competitors and customers in order to gauge relative performance and the outlook for the future. We regularly perform detailed evaluations of the different market segments we are serving to proactively detect trends and to adapt our strategies accordingly. In addition, we believe our order rates are indicative of future revenue and thus are a key measure of anticipated performance.\nCurrent economic conditions have shown improvement but remain mixed across our end markets. The COVID-19 global pandemic continues to impact both the global HVAC and Transport end markets as industry-wide supply chain and resource constraints exist. As vaccine distribution and administration expands, we expect market conditions to continue improving across the geographies where we serve our customers.\nWe believe we have a solid foundation of global brands that are highly differentiated in all of our major product lines. Our geographic and product diversity coupled with our large installed product base provides growth opportunities within our service and corresponding parts and replacement revenue streams. In addition, we are investing substantial resources to innovate and develop new products and services which we expect will drive our future growth.\n30\nResults of Operations\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 - Consolidated Results\nNet Revenues\nNet revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 13.5%, or $1,681.7 million, compared with the same period of 2020. The components of the period change were as follows:\nThe increase in\nNet revenues\nwas primarily driven by increased end customer demand as a result of improved economic conditions as it relates to the COVID-19 global pandemic compared to the full year of 2020, coupled with pricing increases within all of our segments to offset significant material and freight inflation, and a favorable impact from foreign currency translation. Also, during the fourth quarter of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021, we completed three channel acquisitions, two were completed in the Americas segment and the third was completed within the EMEA segment, further driving an increase in\nNet revenues\nas compared to the prior year. Refer to “Results by Segment” below for a discussion of\nNet revenues\nby segment.\nGross Profit Margin\nGross profit margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased 110 basis points to 31.6% compared to 30.5% for the same period of 2020 primarily due to price realization and productivity benefits, partially offset by increased direct material, freight and other inflation.\nSelling and Administrative Expenses\nSelling and administrative expenses\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 7.7%, or $175.7 million, compared with the same period of 2020. The increase in\nSelling and administrative expenses\nwas primarily driven by higher compensation and employee benefits due to headcount growth, higher incentive compensation and lower cost in the prior year due to delays in merit increases and employee furloughs in certain regions, partially offset by lower spending on restructuring and transformation initiatives. However,\nSelling and administrative expenses\nas a percentage of\nNet revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased 90 basis points from 18.2% to 17.3% primarily due to higher revenues year-over-year.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased by 6.0% or $15.0 million compared with the same period of 2020 primarily due to the repayments of $125.0 million of 9.000% Debentures in August 2021, $300.0 million of 2.900% Senior notes in February 2021 and 2020 interest costs related to the $300.0 million of 2.625% Senior notes which were repaid in April 2020.\n31\nOther Income/(Expense), Net\nThe components of\nOther income/(expense), net\n, for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nOther income /(expense), net\nincludes the results from activities other than normal business operations such as interest income and foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency. In addition, we include the components of net periodic benefit credit/(cost) for pension and post retirement obligations other than the service cost component. During the year ended December 31, 2021, other activity, net primarily includes a gain of $12.8 million related to the release of a pension indemnification liability, partially offset by a charge of $7.2 million to increase our Funding Agreement liability from asbestos-related activities of Murray. Other activity, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily includes a $17.4 million adjustment to correct an overstatement of a legacy legal liability that originated in prior years and a gain of $0.9 million related to the deconsolidation of Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs within other activity, net.\nProvision for Income Taxes\nThe 2021 effective tax rate was 18.6% which was lower than the U.S. Statutory rate of 21% due to a $21.4 million reduction in valuation allowances on deferred tax assets primarily related to foreign tax credits as a result of an increase in current year foreign source income, excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments, and earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate. These amounts were partially offset by the recognition of a net $11.6 million tax expense related to a prepayment of an intercompany obligation, U.S. state and local taxes and certain non-deductible employee expenses. Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 29% of our total 2021 revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate.\nThe 2020 effective tax rate was 23.0% which was higher than the U.S. Statutory rate of 21% due to a $36.5 million non-cash charge related to the establishment of valuation allowances on net deferred tax assets, primarily net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions and the write-off of a carryforward tax attribute as a result of the completion of the Transaction, U.S. state and local taxes and certain non-deductible employee expenses. These amounts were partially offset by excess tax benefits from employee share-based payments, a $14.0 million benefit primarily related to a reduction in valuation allowances on deferred taxes related to net operating losses as a result of a planned restructuring in a non-U.S. tax jurisdiction and foreign tax credits as a result of revised projections of future foreign source income and earnings in non-U.S. jurisdictions, which in aggregate have a lower effective tax rate. The impact of the changes in the valuation allowances and the write-off of the carryforward tax attribute increased the effective tax rate by 1.7%.  Revenues from non-U.S. jurisdictions accounted for approximately 28% of our total 2020 revenues, such that a material portion of our pretax income was earned and taxed outside the U.S. at rates ranging from 0% to 38%. When comparing the results of multiple reporting periods, among other factors, the mix of earnings between U.S. and foreign jurisdictions can cause variability in our overall effective tax rate.\n32\nDiscontinued Operations\nThe components of\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\nfor the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nDiscontinued operations are retained obligations from previously sold businesses, including amounts related to Ingersoll Rand Industrial as part of the completion of the Transaction and asbestos-related activities of Aldrich. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a charge of $14.0 million to increase our Funding Agreement liability from asbestos-related activities of Aldrich as well as pension and post retirement obligations and environmental costs related to our formerly owned businesses. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes pre-tax Ingersoll Rand Industrial separation costs primarily related to legal, consulting and advisory fees of $114.2 million and a loss of $25.8 million related to the deconsolidation of Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park.\nThe components of\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\nfor the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nYear Ended December 31, 2021 Compared to the Year Ended December 31, 2020 - Segment Results\nWe operate under three regional operating segments designed to create deep customer focus and relevance in markets around the world.\n•\nOur Americas segment innovates for customers in North America and Latin America. The Americas segment encompasses commercial heating and cooling systems, building controls, and energy services and solutions; residential heating and cooling; and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\n•\nOur EMEA segment innovates for customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The EMEA segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\n•\nOur Asia Pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\nManagement measures operating performance based on net earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations (Segment Adjusted EBITDA). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for net earnings or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. We believe Segment Adjusted EBITDA provides the most relevant measure of profitability as well as earnings power and the ability to generate cash. This measure is a useful financial metric to assess our operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that we believe are not representative of our core business and we use this measure for business planning purposes. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also provides a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods and our ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expense.\n33\nThe following discussion compares our results for each of our three reportable segments for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAmericas\nNet revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 13.1% or $1,271.2 million, compared with the same period of 2020. The components of the period change were as follows:\nThe increase in\nNet revenues\nwas primarily driven by increased end customer demand in all of our businesses as a result of improved economic conditions as it relates to the COVID-19 global pandemic compared to the full year of 2020, favorable pricing to offset significant material and freight inflation and the completion of two channel acquisitions during the fourth quarter of 2020.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 100 basis points to 18.3% compared to 17.3% for the same period of 2020 primarily due to price realization, productivity benefits and higher volumes, which outpaced direct material, freight and other costs driven by inflation and inefficiencies from strained supply chains.\nEMEA\nNet revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 18.0% or $296.8 million, compared with the same period of 2020. The components of the period change were as follows:\n34\nThe increase in\nNet revenues\nwas primarily driven by increased end customer demand as a result of improved economic conditions as it relates to the COVID-19 global pandemic compared to the full year of 2020, a favorable impact from foreign currency translation and favorable pricing to offset significant material and freight inflation. Also, during the first quarter of 2021, we completed a channel acquisition, which is managed in our EMEA segment, and includes sales formerly reported under our Asia Pacific segment, further driving an increase in\nNet revenues\nas compared to the prior year.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 240 basis points to 18.5% compared to 16.1% for the same period of 2020 primarily due to productivity benefits, higher volumes, favorable pricing and favorable product mix, which outpaced direct material, freight and other costs driven by inflation and inefficiencies from strained supply chains.\nAsia Pacific\nNet revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 10.1% or $113.7 million, compared with the same period of 2020. The components of the period change were as follows:\nThe increase in\nNet revenues\nwas primarily driven by increased end customer demand as a result of improved economic conditions as it relates to the COVID-19 global pandemic compared to the full year of 2020, a favorable impact from foreign currency translation and favorable pricing to offset significant material and freight inflation, partially offset by the transfer of sales to the EMEA segment related to the channel acquisition.\nSegment Adjusted EBITDA margin for the year ended December 31, 2021 increased by 170 basis points to 18.5% compared to 16.8% for the same period of 2020. The increase was primarily driven by productivity benefits, favorable pricing and higher volumes as a result of increased customer demand from improved economic conditions driven by the COVID-19 global pandemic, partially offset by increased direct material, freight and other costs driven by inflation and inefficiencies from strained supply chains, and unfavorable product mix.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating, investing and financing activities. In doing so, we review and analyze our current cash on hand, the number of days our sales are outstanding, inventory turns, capital expenditure commitments and income tax payments. Our cash requirements primarily consist of the following:\n•\nFunding of working capital\n•\nDebt service requirements\n•\nFunding of capital expenditures\n•\nDividend payments\n•\nFunding of acquisitions, joint ventures and equity investments\n•\nShare repurchases\nOur primary sources of liquidity include cash balances on hand, cash flows from operations, proceeds from debt offerings, commercial paper, and borrowing availability under our existing credit facilities. We earn a significant amount of our operating income in jurisdictions where it is deemed to be permanently reinvested. Our most prominent jurisdiction of operation is the U.S. We expect existing cash and cash equivalents available to the U.S. operations, the cash generated by our U.S. operations, our committed credit lines as well as our expected ability to access the capital and debt markets will be sufficient to fund our U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. In addition, we expect existing non-U.S. cash and cash equivalents and the cash generated by our non-U.S. operations will be sufficient to fund our non-U.S. operating and capital needs for at least the next twelve months and thereafter for the foreseeable future. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $2.0 billion, of which we had no outstanding balance as of December 31, 2021.\n35\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2,159.2 million of cash and cash equivalents on hand, of which $1,461.8 million was held by non-U.S. subsidiaries. Cash and cash equivalents held by our non-U.S. subsidiaries are generally available for use in our U.S. operations via intercompany loans, equity infusions or via distributions from direct or indirectly owned non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we do not assert permanent reinvestment. As a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act in 2017, additional repatriation opportunities to access cash and cash equivalents held by non-U.S. subsidiaries have been created. In general, repatriation of cash to the U.S. can be completed with no significant incremental U.S. tax. However, to the extent that we repatriate funds from non-U.S. subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment to fund our U.S. operations, we would be required to accrue and pay applicable non-U.S. taxes. As of December 31, 2021, we currently have no plans to repatriate funds from subsidiaries for which we assert permanent reinvestment.\nShare repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with management's balanced capital allocation strategy, subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements. In February 2021, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $2.0 billion of our ordinary shares under the 2021 Authorization upon completion of the prior share repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to $1.5 billion of our ordinary shares (2018 Authorization). During the year ended December 31, 2021, we repurchased and canceled $1.1 billion of our ordinary shares thus completing the 2018 Authorization and initiated repurchases under the 2021 Authorization of $600.2 million of our ordinary shares leaving approximately $1.4 billion remaining under the 2021 Authorization. Additionally, through January 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately $350 million of our ordinary shares under the 2021 Authorization. In February 2022, our Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $3.0 billion of our ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program (2022 Authorization) upon completion of the 2021 Authorization.\nWe expect to pay a competitive and growing dividend. In February 2021, we announced an 11% increase in our quarterly share dividend from $0.53 to $0.59 per ordinary share, or $2.36 per share annualized. All four 2021 quarterly dividends were paid during the year ended December 31, 2021. In February 2022, our Board of Directors declared an increase in our quarterly share dividend by 14%, from $0.59 to $0.67 per ordinary share, or $2.36 to $2.68 per share annualized starting in the first quarter of 2022.\nWe continue to actively manage and strengthen our business portfolio to meet the current and future needs of our customers. We achieve this partly through engaging in research and development and sustaining activities and partly through acquisitions.  Sustaining activities include costs incurred to reduce production costs, improve existing products, create custom solutions for customers and provide support to our manufacturing facilities. Our research and development and sustaining costs account for approximately two percent of annual\nNet revenues.\nEach year, we make investments in new product development and new technology innovation as they are key factors in achieving our strategic objectives as a leader in the climate sector. In addition, we make investments in renewable energy production. For example, we invested in on-site solar energy generation at three of our facilities - Trenton, NJ, Columbia, SC, and Taicang, China - to benefit from operational and cost consistency, which is especially important in parts of the world with uncertain electricity prices and availability. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we completed installation of a photovoltaic (PV) system at our Zhongshan, China facility, which will begin generating solar electricity in 2022. These projects did not result in material expenditures for the year ended December 31, 2021. We continue to look for similar improvement opportunities including, but not limited to, increasing energy efficiency, developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants, reducing material content in products, and designing products for circularity. All NPD programs must complete a Design for Sustainability module within our NPD process to ensure that every program has a positive impact on sustainability. We also focus on partnering with our suppliers and technology providers to align their investment decisions with our technical requirements.\nIn pursuing our business strategy, we routinely conduct discussions, evaluate targets and enter into agreements regarding possible acquisitions, divestitures, joint ventures and equity investments. Since 2019, we have acquired several businesses, entered into joint ventures and invested in companies that complement existing products and services further enhancing our product portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we deployed capital of approximately $340 million attributable to acquisitions and equity investments. In addition, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed a Reverse Morris Trust transaction with Ingersoll Rand whereby we separated Ingersoll Rand Industrial from our business portfolio, transforming the Company into a global climate innovator. We recognized separation-related costs of $114.2 million during the year ended December 31, 2020. These expenditures were incurred in order to facilitate the transaction and are included within\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\n.\n36\nWe incur ongoing costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to result in improved operating performance, profitability and working capital levels. Actions associated with these initiatives may include workforce reductions, improving manufacturing productivity, realignment of management structures and rationalizing certain assets. Post separation, we committed to reduce costs by $190 million through 2021 and an additional $110 million by 2023 for a total of $300 million in total annual savings under our transformation initiatives. In order to achieve these cost savings, we anticipate to incur costs up to $150 million through 2022. We currently have incurred approximately $126 million cumulatively through December 31, 2021. We believe that our existing cash flow, committed credit lines and access to the capital markets will be sufficient to fund share repurchases, dividends, research and development, sustaining activities,\nbusiness portfolio changes and ongoing restructuring actions.\nCertain of our subsidiaries entered into Funding Agreements with Aldrich and Murray pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated, among other things, to pay the costs and expenses of Aldrich and Murray during the pendency of the Chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent that the other assets of Aldrich and Murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding. During the third quarter of 2021, Aldrich and Murray filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to create a $270 million QSF. The funds held in the QSF would be available to provide funding for the Section 524(g) Trust upon effectiveness of the Plan. On January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF. The QSF is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. At this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last.\nAs the COVID-19 global pandemic impacts both the broader economy and our operations, we will continue to assess our liquidity needs and our ability to access capital markets. A continued worldwide disruption could materially affect economies and financial markets worldwide, resulting in an economic downturn that could affect demand for our products, our ability to obtain financing on favorable terms and otherwise adversely impact our business, financial condition and results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A Risk Factors for more information.\nLiquidity\nThe following table contains several key measures of our financial condition and liquidity at the periods ended December 31:\n(1)\nThe $300.0 million of 2.900% Senior notes were repaid in February 2021. The $125.0 million of 9.000% Debentures were repaid in August 2021.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nOur short-term obligations primarily consist of debentures with put features and current maturities of long-term debt. We have outstanding $342.9 million of fixed rate debentures that contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, we are obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder’s option, the outstanding principal amount (plus accrued and unpaid interest) of the debentures held by the holder. We also maintain a commercial paper program which is used for general corporate purposes. Under the program, the maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, is $2.0 billion as of December 31, 2021. We had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the terms of our short-term obligations.\nOur long-term obligations primarily consist of long-term debt with final maturity dates ranging between 2023 and 2049. In addition, we maintain two $1.0 billion senior unsecured revolving credit facilities, one of which matures in April 2023 and the other in June 2026. The facilities provide support for our commercial paper program and can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Total commitments of $2.0 billion were unused at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and further below in\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nfor additional information regarding the terms of our long-term obligations and their related guarantees.\n37\nCash Flows\nThe following table reflects the major categories of cash flows for the years ended December 31, respectively. For additional details, please see the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows in the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOperating Activities\nNet cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $1,594.4 million, of which net income provided $1,837.5 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions. Net cash provided by continuing operating activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $1,766.2 million, of which net income provided $1,422.5 million after adjusting for non-cash transactions. The year-over-year decrease in net cash provided by continuing operating activities was primarily due to higher working capital balances in the current year, partially offset by higher net earnings.\nInvesting Activities\nCash flows from investing activities represents inflows and outflows regarding the purchase and sale of assets. Primary activities associated with these items include capital expenditures, proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment, acquisitions, investments in joint ventures and divestitures. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $545.7 million. The primary drivers of the usage was attributable to the acquisition of businesses, which totaled $269.2 million, net of cash acquired, $223.0 million of capital expenditures and other investing activities of $68.6 million primarily related to investment in several companies that complement existing products and services further enhancing our product portfolio. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations was $338.5 million. The primary drivers of the usage was attributable to the acquisition of businesses, which totaled $182.8 million, net of cash acquired and $146.2 million of capital expenditures. In addition, as a result of the deconsolidation of Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs under the Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, the assets and liabilities of these entities were derecognized, which resulted in a cash outflow of $10.8 million.\nFinancing Activities\nCash flows from financing activities represent inflows and outflows that account for external activities affecting equity and debt. Primary activities associated with these actions include paying dividends to shareholders, repurchasing our own shares, issuing our stock and debt transactions. During the year ended December 31, 2021, net cash used in financing activities from continuing operations was $2,127.6 million. The primary drivers of the outflow related to the the repurchase of $1,100.3 million in ordinary shares, dividends paid to ordinary shareholders of $561.1 million and the repayment of long-term debt of $432.5 million. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations was $884.3 million. The primary driver of the inflow related to the receipt of a special cash payment of $1,900.0 million pursuant to the completion of the Transaction. This amount was partially offset by dividends paid to ordinary shareholders of $507.3 million, the repayment of long-term debt of $307.5 million and the repurchase of $250.0 million in ordinary shares.\n38\nFree Cash Flow\nFree cash flow is a non-GAAP measure and defined as\nNet cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities\n, less capital expenditures, plus cash payments for restructuring and transformation costs. This measure is useful to management and investors because it is consistent with management's assessment of our operating cash flow performance. The most comparable GAAP measure to free cash flow is\nNet cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities\n. Free cash flow may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for\nNet cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities\nin accordance with GAAP.\nA reconciliation of\nNet cash provided by (used in) continuing operating activities\nto free cash flow the years ended December 31 is as follows:\n(1)\nRepresents a non-GAAP measure.\nPension Plans\nOur investment objective in managing defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. We seek to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. Our approach to asset allocation is to increase fixed income assets as the plan's funded status improves. We monitor plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance. In addition, we monitor the impact of market conditions on our defined benefit plans on a regular basis. None of our defined benefit pension plans have experienced a significant impact on their liquidity due to market volatility. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pensions.\nCapital Resources\nBased on historical performance and current expectations, we believe our cash and cash equivalents balance, the cash generated from our operations, our committed credit lines and our expected ability to access capital markets will satisfy our working capital needs, capital expenditures, dividends, share repurchases, upcoming debt maturities, and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations for the foreseeable future.\nCapital expenditures were $223.0 million, $146.2 million and $205.4 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Our investments continue to improve manufacturing productivity, reduce costs, provide environmental enhancements, upgrade information technology infrastructure and security and advanced technologies for existing facilities. The capital expenditure program for 2022 is estimated to be approximately two percent of revenues, including amounts approved in prior periods. Many of these projects are subject to review and cancellation at our option without incurring substantial charges.\nFor financial market risk impacting the Company, see Item 7A. \"Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\"\nCapitalization\nIn addition to cash on hand and operating cash flow, we maintain significant credit availability under our Commercial Paper Program. Our ability to borrow at a cost-effective rate under the Commercial Paper Program is contingent upon maintaining an investment-grade credit rating. As of December 31, 2021, our credit ratings were as follows, remaining unchanged from 2020:\nThe credit ratings set forth above are not a recommendation to buy, sell or hold securities and may be subject to revision or withdrawal by the assigning rating organization. Each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating.\nOur public debt does not contain financial covenants and our revolving credit lines have a debt-to-total capital covenant of 65%. As of December 31, 2021, our debt-to-total capital ratio was significantly beneath this limit.\n39\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual cash obligations include required payments of long-term debt principal and interest, purchase obligations and expected obligations under our pension and postretirement benefit plans. In addition, we have required payments of operating leases, income taxes and expected obligations under the Funding agreement, environmental and product liability matters. For additional information regarding leases, income taxes, including unrecognized tax benefits, and contingent liabilities, see Note 10, Note 17 and Note 21, respectively, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our material cash requirements include the following contractual and other obligations.\nDebt\nAt December 31, 2021, we had outstanding aggregate long-term debt principal payments of $4,872.6 million, with $350.4 million payable within 12 months. The amount payable within 12 months includes $342.9 million of debt redeemable at the option of the holder. The scheduled maturities of these bonds range between 2027 and 2028. Future interest payments on long-term debt total $2,402.4 million, with $215.2 million payable within 12 months. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding debt.\nPurchase Obligations\nPurchase obligations include commitments under legally enforceable contracts or purchase orders. At December 31, 2021, we had purchase obligations of $1,225.0 million, which are primarily payable within 12 months.\nPensions\nIt is our objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. We currently expect that we will contribute approximately $82 million to our enterprise plans worldwide in 2022. The timing and amounts of future contributions are dependent upon the funding status of the plan, which is expected to vary as a result of changes in interest rates, returns on underlying assets, and other factors. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding pensions.\nPostretirement Benefits Other than Pensions\nWe fund postretirement benefit costs principally on a pay-as-you-go basis as medical costs are incurred by covered retiree populations. Benefit payments, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be approximately $34 million in 2022. See Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding postretirement benefits other than pensions.\n40\nSupplemental Guarantor Financial Information\nTrane Technologies plc (Plc or Parent Company) and certain of its 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries provide guarantees of public debt issued by other 100% directly or indirectly owned subsidiaries of Plc. The following table shows our guarantor relationships as of December 31, 2021:\n(1)\nOn April 30, 2021, Trane Technologies Luxembourg Finance S.A. (TT Lux) merged into TTFL, an Irish private limited company, and TTFL became the successor issuer of certain notes and assumed the guarantees and other obligations previously held by TT Lux.\nEach subsidiary debt issuer and guarantor is owned 100% directly or indirectly by the Parent Company. Each guarantee is full and unconditional, and provided on a joint and several basis. There are no significant restrictions of the Parent Company, or any guarantor, to obtain funds from its subsidiaries, such as provisions in debt agreements that prohibit dividend payments, loans or advances to the parent by a subsidiary. The following tables present summarized financial information for the Parent Company and subsidiary debt issuers and guarantors on a combined basis (together, \"obligor group\") after elimination of intercompany transactions and balances based on the Company’s legal entity ownerships and guarantees outstanding at December 31, 2021. Our obligor groups as of December 31, 2021 were as follows: obligor group 1 consists of Plc, TT Holdings, TT International, TT Global, TTFL, TTC HoldCo and TTC; obligor group 2 consists of Plc, TTFL and TTC.\nSummarized Statements of Earnings\n41\nSummarized Balance Sheet\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nManagement’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations are based upon our Consolidated Financial Statements, which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP). The preparation of financial statements in conformity with those accounting principles requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions based on the relevant information available at the end of each period. These estimates and assumptions have a significant effect on reported amounts of assets and liabilities, revenue and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities because they result primarily from the need to make estimates and assumptions on matters that are inherently uncertain. Actual results may differ from these estimates. If updated information or actual amounts are different from previous estimates, the revisions are included in our results for the period in which they become known.\nThe following is a summary of certain accounting estimates and assumptions made by management that we consider critical.\n•\nGoodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets – We have significant goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets on our balance sheet related to acquisitions. These assets are tested and reviewed annually during the fourth quarter for impairment or when there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of an asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. In addition, an interim impairment test is completed upon a triggering event or when there is a reorganization of reporting structure or disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit.\nThe determination of estimated fair value requires us to make assumptions about estimated cash flows, including profit margins, long-term forecasts, discount rates and terminal growth rates. We developed these assumptions based on the market and geographic risks unique to each reporting unit. The estimates of fair value are based on the best information available as of the date of the assessment, which primarily incorporates management assumptions about expected future cash flows.\nAnnual Goodwill Impairment Test\nImpairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with a qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. For those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment, the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\n42\nAs quoted market prices are not available for our reporting units, the calculation of their estimated fair value is determined using three valuation techniques: a discounted cash flow model (an income approach), a market-adjusted multiple of earnings and revenues (a market approach), and a similar transactions method (also a market approach). The discounted cash flow approach relies on our estimates of future cash flows and explicitly addresses factors such as timing, growth and margins, with due consideration given to forecasting risk. The multiple of earnings and revenues approach reflects the market's expectations for future growth and risk, with adjustments to account for differences between the guideline publicly traded companies and the subject reporting units. The similar transactions method considers prices paid in transactions that have recently occurred in our industry or in related industries. These valuation techniques are weighted 50%, 40% and 10%, respectively.\nOther Indefinite-lived intangible assets\nImpairment of other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives is first assessed using a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that an indefinite-lived intangible asset is impaired. This assessment is used as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to calculate the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset. For those indefinite-lived assets where it is required, a fair value is determined on a relief from royalty methodology (income approach) which is based on the implied royalty paid, at an appropriate discount rate, to license the use of an asset rather than owning the asset. The present value of the after-tax cost savings (i.e., royalty relief) indicates the estimated fair value of the asset. Any excess of the carrying value over the estimated fair value would be recognized as an impairment loss equal to that excess.\n•\nBusiness combinations - Acquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. We include the operating results of acquired entities from their respective dates of acquisition. We recognize and measure the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration relating to potential earnout provisions. and any non-controlling interest as of the acquisition date fair value. The valuation of intangible assets is determined using an income approach methodology. We use assumptions to value the intangible assets including projected future revenues, customer attrition rates, royalty rates, tax rates and discount rates. The excess, if any, of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and any non-controlling interest is recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred.\nContingent consideration\nWe assess any contingent consideration included in the consideration paid of a business combination. The value recorded is based on estimates of future financial projections on revenue under various potential scenarios, in which a Monte Carlo simulation model runs many iterations based on comparable companies' revenue growth rates and their implied revenue volatilities. These cash flow projections are discounted with a risk adjusted rate. Each quarter until such contingent amounts are earned, the fair value of the liability is remeasured at each reporting period and adjusted as a component of operating expenses based on changes to the underlying assumptions. The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment, specifically revenue growth rates, implied revenue volatilities and discount rates.\n•\nAsbestos matters – Prior to the Petition Date, certain of our wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. We recorded a liability for our actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. We performed a detailed analysis and projected an estimated range of the total liability for pending and unasserted future asbestos-related claims. We recorded the liability at the low end of the range as we believed that no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount. Our key assumptions underlying the estimated asbestos-related liabilities included the number of people occupationally exposed and likely to develop asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer, the number of people likely to file an asbestos-related personal injury claim against us, the average settlement and resolution of each claim and the percentage of claims resolved with no payment. Asbestos-related defense costs were excluded from the asbestos claims liability and were recorded separately as services were incurred. None of our existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. We recorded certain income and expenses associated with our asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\n, as they related to previously divested businesses, except for amounts associated with asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries of Murray and its predecessors, which were recorded within continuing operations.\n43\n•\nRevenue recognition – Revenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A majority of our revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. However, a portion of our revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as we perform work under a contract. For these arrangements, the cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as we incur costs.\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects our expectations about the consideration we will be entitled to receive from a customer. To determine the transaction price, variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists. We include variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. We consider historical data in determining our best estimates of variable consideration, and the related accruals are recorded using the expected value method.\nWe enter into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services. For these arrangements, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation and whether the sales price for each obligation is representative of standalone selling price. If available, we utilize observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to evaluate relative standalone selling price. List prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices. Where necessary, we ensure that the total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on the determination of their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement.\nWe recognize revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct, control of the good or service has transferred to the customer, and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist. For extended warranties and long-term service agreements, revenue for these distinct performance obligations are recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the respective contract term.\n•\nIncome taxes – Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. We recognize future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in our judgment to be more likely than not. We regularly review the recoverability of our deferred tax assets considering our historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of our tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, we record a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit.\nThe provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income, and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by us. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by us and can raise issues regarding our filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which we operate. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. We believe that we have adequately provided for any reasonably foreseeable resolution of these matters. We will adjust our estimate if significant events so dictate. To the extent that the ultimate results differ from our original or adjusted estimates, the effect will be recorded in the provision for income taxes in the period that the matter is finally resolved.\n•\nEmployee benefit plans – We provide a range of benefits to eligible employees and retirees, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuarial valuations are performed to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated and amortized into earnings over future periods. We review our actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and make modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate. The discount rate, the rate of compensation increase and the expected long-term rates of return on plan assets are determined as of each measurement date. We believe that the assumptions utilized in recording our obligations under our plans are reasonable based on input from our actuaries, outside investment advisors and information as to assumptions used by plan sponsors.\n44\nChanges in any of the assumptions can have an impact on the net periodic pension cost or postretirement benefit cost. Estimated sensitivities to the expected 2022 net periodic pension cost of a 0.25% rate decline in the two basic assumptions are as follows: the decline in the discount rate would increase expense by approximately $4.2 million and the decline in the estimated return on assets would increase expense by approximately $7.2 million. A 0.25% rate decrease in the discount rate for postretirement benefits would increase expected 2022 net periodic postretirement benefit cost by $0.5 million.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a discussion of recent accounting pronouncements."

    "text": "We are exposed to fluctuations in currency exchange rates, interest rates and commodity prices which could impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nForeign Currency Exposures\nWe have operations throughout the world that manufacture and sell products in various international markets. As a result, we are exposed to movements in exchange rates of various currencies against the U.S. dollar as well as against other currencies throughout the world.\nMany of our non-U.S. operations have a functional currency other than the U.S. dollar, and their results are translated into U.S. dollars for reporting purposes. Therefore, our reported results will be higher or lower depending on the weakening or strengthening of the U.S. dollar against the respective foreign currency. Our largest concentration of revenues from non-U.S. operations as of December 31, 2021 are in Euros and Chinese Yuan. A hypothetical 10% unfavorable change in the average exchange rate used to translate\nNet revenues\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 from either Euros or Chinese Yuan-based operations into U.S. dollars would result in a decline of approximately $135 million and $70 million, respectively.\nWe use derivative instruments to hedge those material exposures that cannot be naturally offset. The instruments utilized are viewed as risk management tools, primarily involve little complexity and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. To minimize the risk of counterparty non-performance, derivative instrument agreements are made only through major financial institutions with significant experience in such derivative instruments.\nWe evaluate our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates on our foreign currency derivatives using a sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity analysis is a measurement of the potential loss in fair value based on a percentage change in exchange rates. Based on the currency derivative instruments in place at December 31, 2021, a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10% adverse change in exchange rates would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $18.1 million, as compared with $22.3 million at December 31, 2020. These amounts, when realized, would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions.\nCommodity Price Exposures\nWe are exposed to volatility in the prices of commodities used in some of our products and we use commodity hedge contracts in the financial derivatives market and fixed price purchase contracts to manage this exposure. Commodity risks are systematically managed pursuant to policy guidelines. As a cash flow hedge, gains and losses resulting from the hedging instruments mitigate a portion of our exposures to changes in commodity prices. The maturities of the commodity hedge contracts coincide with the expected purchase of the commodities. Based on the commodity derivative instruments in place at December 31, 2021, a hypothetical change in fair value of those derivative instruments assuming a 10% decrease in commodity prices would result in an unrealized loss of approximately $7.5 million. These amounts, when realized, would be offset by changes in the fair value of the underlying commodity purchases.\nInterest Rate Exposure\nOur debt portfolio mainly consists of fixed-rate instruments, and therefore any fluctuation in market interest rates is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations.\n45\nItem 8.\nFINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(a)\nThe following Consolidated Financial Statements and the report thereon of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP dated February 7, 2022, are presented in this Annual Report on Form 10-K beginning on page F-1.\nConsolidated Financial Statements:\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020\nConsolidated Statements of Equity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements"

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nF-2\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nFair Value Measurements of the Contingent Consideration for Farrar Scientific Corporation Acquisition\nAs described in Note 18 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company acquired 100% of Farrar Scientific Corporation’s (Farrar Scientific) assets. The purchase price for the acquisition was expected to be $349.9 million, comprised of the upfront cash consideration of $251.2 million and the fair value of the contingent consideration relating to an earnout payment at the time of closing the acquisition of $98.7 million. The contingent consideration is payable in 2025 based on the achievement of certain revenue targets by Farrar Scientific from January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024.  Management determines the estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability using a Monte Carlo simulation model, which runs many iterations based on comparable companies’ revenue growth rates and their implied revenue volatilities.  The estimates used to determine the fair value of the contingent consideration liability are subject to significant judgment, specifically revenue growth rates and implied revenue volatilities.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the fair value measurement of the contingent consideration for the Farrar Scientific acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the contingent consideration; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence relating to management's Monte Carlo simulation model and significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates and implied revenue volatilities; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to management’s fair value of the contingent consideration, including controls over the development of significant assumptions related to revenue growth rates and implied revenue volatilities. These procedures also included, among others, (i) reading the purchase agreement, (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value estimate of the contingent consideration, (iii) evaluating the appropriateness of the Monte Carlo simulation model, (iv) testing the completeness and accuracy of underlying data used in the model, and (v) evaluating the significant assumptions used by management related to revenue growth rates and implied revenue volatilities. Evaluating management's assumptions related to revenue growth rates involved assessing whether the assumptions used by management were reasonable considering current and past performance of the acquired business, consistency with external market data, and whether these assumptions were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the appropriateness of the Monte Carlo simulation model and evaluating the appropriateness of the implied revenue volatilities assumption.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nCharlotte, North Carolina\nFebruary 7, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since at least 1906. We have not been able to determine the specific year we began serving as auditor of the Company.\nF-3\nTrane Technologies plc\nConsolidated Statements of Earnings\nIn millions, except per share amounts\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-4\nTrane Technologies plc\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nIn millions\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-5\nTrane Technologies plc\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nIn millions, except share amounts\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-6\nTrane Technologies plc\nConsolidated Statements of Equity\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-7\nTrane Technologies plc\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nIn millions\nSee accompanying notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\nF-8\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1.\nDESCRIPTION OF COMPANY\nTrane Technologies, public limited company (plc), incorporated in Ireland in 2009, and its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively we, our, the Company) is a global climate innovator. The Company brings sustainable and efficient solutions to buildings, homes and transportation through the Company's strategic brands, Trane\n®\nand Thermo King\n®\n, and its environmentally responsible portfolio of products, services and connected intelligent controls. The Company generates revenue and cash primarily through the design, manufacture, sales and service of solutions for Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (HVAC) and transport refrigeration. As an industry leader with an extensive global install base, the Company's growth strategy includes expanding recurring revenue through services and rental options.\nCOVID-19 Global Pandemic\nIn March 2020, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a global pandemic and recommended containment and mitigation measures worldwide. During the first half of 2020, the COVID-19 global pandemic adversely impacted the Company's business globally including, but not limited to, lower end customer demand, certain supply chain delays, temporary facility closures and limitations of the Company's workforce to essential crews only. In response, the Company proactively initiated cost cutting actions and actively managed its supply chain in an effort to mitigate the impact of the global pandemic on its business. Despite the challenges set forth by the COVID-19 global pandemic, the Company continued to sell, install and service its products, invest in its businesses, develop and launch new products and deliver innovative customer solutions for electrification of heating, cooling and transport, enhanced indoor air quality, and precise temperature control along the full vaccine cold chain.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company experienced significant increases in end market demand, executed price increases to cover rapidly increasing material, component and logistics costs and realized strong earnings growth as a result of strong execution across its organization. In addition, to meet the Company's increased customer demand, the Company is proactively managing industry-wide supply chain and resource constraints and is working closely with its suppliers, customers and logistics providers to mitigate the impacts on its business as the Company continues to sell, install and service its products.\nThe Company will continue to monitor the ongoing COVID-19 global pandemic as it evolves and will assess any potential impacts to its business and financial statements as necessary.\nCompletion of Reverse Morris Trust Transaction\nOn February 29, 2020 (Distribution Date), the Company completed its Reverse Morris Trust transaction (the Transaction) with Gardner Denver Holdings, Inc. (Gardner Denver) whereby the Company separated its former Industrial segment (Ingersoll Rand Industrial) through a pro rata distribution to shareholders of record as of February 24, 2020. Ingersoll Rand Industrial then merged into a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gardner Denver, which changed its name to Ingersoll Rand Inc. (Ingersoll Rand). Upon close of the Transaction, the Company’s existing shareholders received 50.1% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock on a fully-diluted basis and Gardner Denver stockholders retained 49.9% of the shares of Ingersoll Rand on a fully diluted basis. As a result, the Company’s shareholders received .8824 shares of Ingersoll Rand common stock with respect to each share owned as of February 24, 2020. In connection with the Transaction, the Company received a special cash payment of $\n1.9\nbillion.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the the Company paid Ingersoll Rand $\n49.5\nmillion to settle certain items related to the Transaction. This payment was related to working capital, cash and indebtedness amounts as of the Distribution Date, as well as funding levels related to pension plans, non-qualified deferred compensation plans and retiree health benefits. The Company recorded the settlement as a reduction to\nRetained earnings\nduring the first quarter of 2021.\nDiscontinued Operations\nAfter the Distribution Date, the Company does not beneficially own any Ingersoll Rand Industrial shares of common stock and no longer consolidates Ingersoll Rand Industrial in its financial statements. The historical results of Ingersoll Rand Industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nF-9\nReorganization of Aldrich and Murray\nOn May 1, 2020, certain subsidiaries of the Company underwent an internal corporate restructuring that was effectuated through a series of transactions (2020 Corporate Restructuring). As a result, Aldrich Pump LLC (Aldrich) and Murray Boiler LLC (Murray), indirect wholly-owned subsidiaries of Trane Technologies plc, became solely responsible for the asbestos-related liabilities, and the beneficiaries of the asbestos-related insurance assets, of Trane Technologies Company LLC and Trane U.S. Inc, respectively. On a consolidated basis, the 2020 Corporate Restructuring did not have an impact on the Consolidated Financial Statements. In connection with the 2020 Corporate Restructuring, certain subsidiaries of the Company entered into funding agreements with Aldrich and Murray (collectively the Funding Agreements), pursuant to which those subsidiaries are obligated, among other things, to pay the costs and expenses of Aldrich and Murray during the pendency of the Chapter 11 cases to the extent distributions from their respective subsidiaries are insufficient to do so and to provide an amount for the funding for a trust established pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent that the other assets of Aldrich and Murray are insufficient to provide the requisite trust funding.\nOn June 18, 2020 (Petition Date), Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of Title 11 of the United States Code (the Bankruptcy Code) in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of North Carolina (the Bankruptcy Court) to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. Only Aldrich and Murray have filed for Chapter 11 relief. Neither Aldrich's wholly-owned subsidiary, 200 Park, Inc. (200 Park), Murray's wholly-owned subsidiary, ClimateLabs LLC (ClimateLabs), Trane Technologies plc nor its other subsidiaries (the Trane Companies) are part of the Chapter 11 filings. The Trane Companies are expected to continue to operate as usual, with no disruption to their employees, suppliers, or customers globally. However, as of the\nPetition Date, Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park and Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs were deconsolidated and their respective assets and liabilities were derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for more information regarding the Chapter 11 bankruptcy and asbestos-related matters.\nNOTE 2.\nSUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nA summary of significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements follows:\nBasis of Presentation:\nThe accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements reflect the consolidated operations of the Company and have been prepared in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) as defined by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) within the FASB Accounting Standards Codification (ASC). Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The results of operations and cash flows of all discontinued operations have been separately reported as discontinued operations for all periods presented.\nNet revenues\nand cost of goods sold reported on the Consolidated Statements of Earnings have been revised for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 to separately present net revenues of products and services and cost of products and services. These presentation adjustments had no impact on\nEarnings from continuing operations\nor\nNet earnings\n.\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include all majority-owned subsidiaries of the Company. A noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is considered an ownership interest in a majority-owned subsidiary that is not attributable to the parent. The Company includes\nNoncontrolling interest\nas a component of\nTotal equity\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets and the\nNet earnings attributable\nto\nnoncontrolling interests\nare presented as an adjustment from\nNet earnings\nused to arrive at\nNet earnings attributable to Trane Technologies plc\nin the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates are based on several factors including the facts and circumstances available at the time the estimates are made, historical experience, risk of loss, general economic conditions and trends, and the assessment of the probable future outcome. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period that they are determined.\nCurrency Translation:\nAssets and liabilities of non-U.S. subsidiaries, where the functional currency is not the U.S. dollar, have been translated at year-end exchange rates, and income and expense accounts have been translated using average exchange rates throughout the year. Adjustments resulting from the process of translating an entity’s financial statements into the U.S. dollar have been recorded in the equity section of the Consolidated Balance Sheets within\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n. Transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency are subject to changes in exchange rates with the resulting gains and losses recorded within\nOther income/(expense), net.\nF-10\nCash and Cash Equivalents:\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, demand deposits and all highly liquid investments with original maturities at the time of purchase of three months or less. The Company maintains amounts on deposit at various financial institutions, which may at times exceed federally insured limits. However, management periodically evaluates the credit-worthiness of those institutions and has not experienced any losses on such deposits.\nAllowance for Credit Losses\n:\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses which represents the best estimate of expected loss inherent in the Company's accounts receivable portfolio. This estimate is based upon a two-step policy that results in the total recorded allowance for credit losses. The first step is to record a portfolio reserve based on the aging of the outstanding accounts receivable portfolio and the Company's historical experience with the Company's end markets, customer base and products. The second step is to create a specific reserve for significant accounts as to which the customer's ability to satisfy their financial obligation to the Company is in doubt due to circumstances such as bankruptcy, deteriorating operating results or financial position. In these circumstances, management uses its judgment to record an allowance based on the best estimate of expected loss, factoring in such considerations as the market value of collateral, if applicable. Actual results could differ from those estimates. These estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically, and the effects of changes, if any, are reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings in the period that they are determined. The Company's allowance for credit losses was $\n39.9\nmillion and $\n40.0\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nInventories:\nDepending on the business, U.S. inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the last-in, first-out (LIFO) method or the lower of cost and net realizable value (NRV) using the first-in, first-out (FIFO) method. Non-U.S. inventories are stated at the lower of cost and NRV using the FIFO method. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately\n54\n% and\n60\n%, respectively, of all inventory utilized the LIFO method.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation. Assets placed in service are recorded at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of the asset except for leasehold improvements, which are depreciated over the shorter of their economic useful life or their lease term.\nThe range of useful lives used to depreciate property, plant and equipment is as follows:\nMajor expenditures for replacements and significant improvements that increase asset values and extend useful lives are also capitalized. Capitalized costs are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight-line method. Repairs and maintenance expenditures that do not extend the useful life of the asset are charged to expense as incurred. The carrying amounts of assets that are sold or retired and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts in the year of disposal, and any resulting gain or loss is reflected within current earnings.\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its property, plant and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets:\nThe Company records as goodwill the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired in a business combination. Measurement period adjustments may be recorded once a final valuation has been performed. Goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested and reviewed annually for impairment during the fourth quarter or whenever there is a significant change in events or circumstances that indicate that the fair value of the asset is more likely than not less than the carrying amount of the asset. In addition, an interim impairment test is completed upon a triggering event or when there is a reorganization of reporting structure or disposal of all or a portion of a reporting unit.\nImpairment of goodwill is assessed at the reporting unit level and begins with an optional qualitative assessment to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of each reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform the goodwill impairment test. For those reporting units that bypass or fail the qualitative assessment, the test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit to its estimated fair value. If the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount, goodwill of the reporting unit is not impaired. To the extent that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment loss will be recognized for the amount by which the reporting unit's carrying amount exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill in that reporting unit.\nF-11\nIntangible assets such as customer-related intangible assets and other intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated economic lives.\nThe weighted-average useful lives approximate the following:\nThe Company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of its intangible assets with finite useful lives whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset group may not be recoverable. Recoverability is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to the future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group. If the undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset group, an impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group.\nBusiness Combinations:\nAcquisitions that meet the definition of a business combination are recorded using the acquisition method of accounting. The Company includes the operating results of acquired entities from their respective dates of acquisition. The Company recognizes and measures the identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed, including contingent consideration relating to earnout provisions, and any non-controlling interest as of the acquisition date fair value. The excess, if any, of total consideration transferred in a business combination over the fair value of identifiable assets acquired, liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest is recognized as goodwill. Costs incurred as a result of a business combination other than costs related to the issuance of debt or equity securities are recorded in the period the costs are incurred. Additionally, at each reporting period, contingent consideration is remeasured to fair value, with changes recorded in\nSelling and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.\nEquity Investments:\nPartially-owned equity affiliates generally represent\n20\n-\n50\n% ownership interests in equity investments where the Company demonstrates significant influence, but does not have a controlling financial interest. Partially-owned equity affiliates are accounted for under the equity method.\nThe Company invests in companies that complement existing products and services further enhancing its product portfolio. The Company records equity investments for which it does not have significant influence and without a readily determinable fair value at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairment as permitted by the measurement alternative. Investments for which the measurement alternative has been elected are assessed for impairment upon a triggering event. Equity investments without a readily determinable fair value were $\n115.6\nmillion and $\n54.1\nmillion for the years ended  December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nEmployee Benefit Plans\n:\nThe Company provides a range of benefits, including pensions, postretirement and postemployment benefits to eligible current and former employees. Determining the cost associated with such benefits is dependent on various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, expected return on plan assets, compensation increases, mortality, turnover rates, and healthcare cost trend rates. Actuaries perform the required calculations to determine expense in accordance with GAAP. Actual results may differ from the actuarial assumptions and are generally accumulated into\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nand amortized into\nNet earnings\nover future periods. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions at each measurement date and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends, if appropriate.\nLoss Contingencies:\nLiabilities are recorded for various contingencies arising in the normal course of business. The Company has recorded reserves in the financial statements related to these matters, which are developed using input derived from actuarial estimates and historical and anticipated experience data depending on the nature of the reserve, and in certain instances with consultation of legal counsel, internal and external consultants and engineers. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for these types of liabilities, the Company believes its estimated reserves are reasonable and does not believe the final determination of the liabilities with respect to these matters would have a material effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company for any year.\nEnvironmental Costs:\nThe Company is subject to laws and regulations relating to protecting the environment. Environmental expenditures relating to current operations are expensed or capitalized as appropriate. Expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations, which do not contribute to current or future revenues, are expensed. Liabilities for remediation costs are recorded when they are probable and can be reasonably estimated, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the Company’s commitment to a plan of action. The assessment of this liability, which is calculated based on existing remediation technology, does not reflect any offset for possible recoveries from insurance companies, and is not discounted\n.\nF-12\nAsbestos Matters\n:\nPrior to the Petition Date, certain of the Company's wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies were named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. The Company recorded a liability for actual and anticipated future claims as well as an asset for anticipated insurance settlements. Asbestos-related defense costs were excluded from the asbestos claims liability and were recorded separately as services were incurred. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos. The Company recorded certain income and expenses associated with asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries within\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\n, as they related to previously divested businesses, except for amounts associated with the predecessor of Murray's asbestos liabilities and corresponding insurance recoveries, which were recorded within continuing operations.\nProduct Warranties:\nStandard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.\nThe Company's extended warranty liability represents the deferred revenue associated with its extended warranty contracts and is amortized into revenue on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liability by evaluating the expected costs under its existing contracts to ensure these expected costs do not exceed the extended warranty liability.\nIncome Taxes:\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. The Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating losses and tax credits, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered in its judgment to be more likely than not. The Company regularly reviews the recoverability of its deferred tax assets considering its historic profitability, projected future taxable income, timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences and the feasibility of its tax planning strategies. Where appropriate, the Company records a valuation allowance with respect to a future tax benefit.\nRevenue Recognition:\nRevenue is recognized when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A majority of the Company's revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. However, a portion of the Company's revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as the Company performs work under a contract. For these arrangements, the cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding revenue recognition.\nResearch and Development Costs:\nThe Company conducts research and development activities focused on product and system sustainability improvements such as increasing energy efficiency, developing products that allow for use of lower global warming potential refrigerants, reducing material content in products, and designing products for circularity. These expenditures are expensed when incurred. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, these expenditures amounted to $\n193.5\nmillion, $\n165.0\nmillion and $\n174.2\nmillion, respectively.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nThe FASB ASC is the sole source of authoritative GAAP other than the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued rules and regulations that apply only to SEC registrants. The FASB issues an Accounting Standard Update (ASU) to communicate changes to the codification. The Company considers the applicability and impact of all ASU's. ASU's not listed below were assessed and determined to be either not applicable or are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nRecently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers” (ASU 2021-08), which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized and measured by the acquirer on the acquisition date in accordance with ASC 606, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” (ASC 606). ASU 2021-08 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022 including interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company early adopted this standard during the fourth quarter of 2021 and applied it retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred on or after January 1, 2021 resulting in no material impact on its financial statements.\nF-13\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12, “Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes\" (ASU 2019-12), which simplifies certain aspects of income tax accounting guidance in ASC 740, reducing the complexity of its application. Certain exceptions to ASC 740 presented within the ASU include: intraperiod tax allocation, deferred tax liabilities related to outside basis differences, year-to-date loss in interim periods, among others. ASU 2019-12 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2020 including interim periods therein with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2021 with no material impact on its financial statements.\nIn October 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-09, \"Debt (Topic 470): Amendments to SEC Paragraphs Pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10762\" (ASU 2020-09), which amends Topic 470 and certain other topics to conform to disclosure rules on guaranteed debt offerings in SEC Release No.33-10762. The SEC adopted amendments to the financial disclosure requirements for guarantors and issuers of guaranteed securities registered or being registered in Rule 3-10 of Regulations S-X, and affiliates whose securities registered or being registered in Rule 3-16 of Regulation S-X. The amended rules aim to improve disclosure, reduce compliance burdens for issuers and increase investor protection. ASU 2020-09 is effective on January 4, 2021, pursuant to SEC Release No. 33-10762 with early application permitted. The Company early adopted this standard during the first quarter of 2020 and elected to disclose summarized financial information of the issuers and guarantors on a combined basis within Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued ASU 2018-15, \"Customer's Accounting for Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that is a Service Contract\" (ASU 2018-15), which aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs in a cloud-computing arrangement service contract with the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain internal-use software. In addition, the guidance also clarifies the presentation requirements for reporting such costs in the financial statements. ASU 2018-15 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2019 with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 on a prospective basis with no material impact on its financial statements.\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued ASU 2016-13, which changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments from an incurred loss model to an expected loss model. In addition, the guidance also requires incremental disclosures regarding allowances and credit quality indicators. ASU 2016-13 was adopted using the modified-retrospective approach and is effective in fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2019, including interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 with no material impact on its financial statements.\nRecently Issued Accounting Pronouncements\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-10, \"Government Assistance (Topic 832): Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance\" (ASU 2021-10), which requires additional disclosures regarding government grants and cash contributions. The additional disclosures required by this update include information about the nature of the transactions and the related accounting policy used to account for the transaction, the financial statement line items affected by the transactions and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line item and significant terms and conditions of the transactions, including commitments and contingencies. ASU 2021-10 is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021 with early adoption permitted. The Company does not expect this ASU to have a material impact on its financial statements.\nNOTE 3.\nINVENTORIES\nAt December 31, the major classes of inventory were as follows:\nThe Company performs periodic assessments to determine the existence of obsolete, slow-moving and non-saleable inventories and records necessary provisions to reduce such inventories to the lower of cost and NRV. Reserve balances, primarily related to obsolete and slow-moving inventories, were $\n79.0\nmillion and $\n85.6\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nF-14\nNOTE 4.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nAt December 31, the major classes of property, plant and equipment were as follows:\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n170.5\nmillion, $\n172.8\nmillion and $\n167.2\nmillion, which include amounts for software amortization of $\n45.7\nmillion, $\n50.2\nmillion and $\n55.4\nmillion, respectively.\nNOTE 5.\nGOODWILL\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill are as follows:\n(1)\nRefer to Note 18, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures\" for more information regarding acquisitions.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies\" for more information regarding the Chapter 11 bankruptcy and asbestos-related matters.\nThe net goodwill balances at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 include $\n2,496.0\nmillion of accumulated impairment, primarily related to the Americas segment. The accumulated impairment relates entirely to a charge recorded in 2008.\nNOTE 6.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table sets forth the gross amount and related accumulated amortization of the Company’s intangible assets at December 31:\nIntangible asset amortization expense for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n123.6\nmillion, $\n115.7\nmillion and $\n116.7\nmillion, respectively.\nF-15\nFuture estimated amortization expense on existing intangible assets in the next five years as of December 31, 2021 amounts to approximately:\nNOTE 7.\nDEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES\nAt December 31,\nShort-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt\nconsisted of the following:\n(1)\nThe 2.900% Senior notes were repaid in February 2021.\n(2)\nThe 9.000% Debentures were repaid in August 2021.\nThe Company's short-term obligations primarily consist of debentures with put features and current maturities of long-term debt. The weighted-average interest rate for\nShort-term borrowings and current maturities of long-term debt\nat December 31, 2021 and 2020 was\n6.3\n% and\n5.4\n%, respectively.\nCommercial Paper Program\nThe Company uses borrowings under its commercial paper program for general corporate purposes. The maximum aggregate amount of unsecured commercial paper notes available to be issued, on a private placement basis, under the commercial paper program is $\n2.0\nbillion as of December 31, 2021. Under the commercial paper program, the Company may issue notes from time to time through Trane Technologies HoldCo Inc. or Trane Technologies Financing Limited. Each of Trane Technologies plc, Trane Technologies Irish Holdings Unlimited Company, Trane Technologies Lux International Holding Company S.à.r.l., Trane Technologies Global Holding Company Limited, Trane Technologies Company LLC, Trane Technologies HoldCo Inc. and Trane Technologies Financing Limited provided irrevocable and unconditional guarantees for any notes issued under the commercial paper program. The Company had no outstanding balance under its commercial paper program as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nDebentures with Put Feature\nAt December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n342.9\nmillion of fixed rate debentures outstanding which contain a put feature that the holders may exercise on each anniversary of the issuance date. If exercised, the Company is obligated to repay in whole or in part, at the holder’s option, the outstanding principal amount of the debentures plus accrued interest. If these options are not exercised, the final contractual maturity dates would range between 2027 and 2028. Holders of these debentures had the option to exercise the put feature on each of the outstanding debentures in 2021, subject to the notice requirement. No material exercises were made in 2021 or 2020.\nF-16\nAt December 31,\nlong-term debt\nexcluding current maturities consisted of:\nScheduled maturities of\nlong-term debt,\nincluding current maturities, as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nOther Credit Facilities\nOn June 18, 2021, the Company entered into a new $\n1.0\nbillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in June 2026 (2026 Credit Facility) and terminated its $\n1.0\nbillion facility set to expire in March 2022. On September 24, 2021, the Company amended its other $\n1.0\nbillion senior unsecured revolving credit facility which matures in April 2023 (2023 Credit Facility) primarily to conform the interest rate provisions in the 2023 Credit Facility to the terms included in the 2026 Credit Facility. As a result, the Company maintains two $\n1.0\nbillion senior unsecured revolving credit facilities (collectively, the Facilities) through its wholly-owned subsidiaries, Trane Technologies HoldCo Inc., Trane Technologies Global Holding Company Limited and Trane Technologies Financing Limited (collectively, the Borrowers). The covenants under the 2026 Credit Facility are substantially the same as the covenants under the 2023 Credit Facility. The terms of the 2026 Credit Facility include Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) metrics related to two of the Company’s sustainability commitments: a reduction in greenhouse gas intensity and an increase in the percentage of women in management. The Company's annual performance against these ESG metrics may result in price adjustments to the commitment fee and applicable interest rate.\nEach senior unsecured credit facility provides support for the Company's commercial paper program and can be used for working capital and other general corporate purposes. Trane Technologies plc, Trane Technologies Irish Holdings Unlimited Company, Trane Technologies Lux International Holding Company S.à.r.l. and Trane Technologies Company LLC each provide irrevocable and unconditional guarantees for these Facilities. In addition, each Borrower will guarantee the obligations under the Facilities of the other Borrower. Total commitments of $\n2.0\nbillion were unused at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nFair Value of Debt\nThe fair value of the Company's debt instruments at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $\n5.6\nbillion and $\n6.3\nbillion, respectively. The Company measures the fair value of its long-term debt instruments for disclosure purposes based upon observable market prices quoted on public exchanges for similar assets. These fair value inputs are considered Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy.\nF-17\nNOTE 8.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is exposed to certain risks arising from business operations and economic factors. These fluctuations can increase the cost of financing, investing and operating the business. The Company uses various financial instruments, including derivative instruments, to manage the risks associated with interest rate, commodity price and foreign currency exposures. These financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes. The Company recognizes all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at their fair value as either assets or liabilities.\nOn the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Company designates the derivative instrument as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction or as an undesignated derivative. The Company formally documents its hedge relationships, including identification of the derivative instruments and the hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction. This process includes linking derivative instruments that are designated as hedges to specific assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.\nThe Company assesses at inception and at least quarterly thereafter, whether the derivatives used in cash flow hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting the changes in the cash flows of the hedged item. To the extent the derivative is deemed to be a highly effective hedge, the fair market value changes of the instrument are recorded to\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\n(AOCI). If the hedging relationship ceases to be highly effective, or it becomes probable that a forecasted transaction is no longer expected to occur, the hedging relationship will be undesignated and any future gains and losses on the derivative instrument will be recorded in\nNet earnings\n.\nThe fair values of derivative instruments included within the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31 were as follows:\nAsset and liability derivatives included in the table above are recorded within\nOther current assets\nand\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n, respectively.\nCurrency Derivative Instruments\nThe notional amount of the Company’s currency derivatives was $\n0.5\nbillion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, a net loss of $\n2.2\nmillion and $\n0.7\nmillion, net of tax, respectively, was included in AOCI related to the fair value of the Company’s currency derivatives designated as accounting hedges. The amount expected to be reclassified into\nNet earnings\nover the next twelve months is a loss of $\n2.2\nmillion. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to\nNet earnings\nmay vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. Gains and losses associated with the Company’s currency derivatives not designated as hedges are recorded in\nNet earnings\nas changes in fair value occur. At December 31, 2021, the maximum term of the Company’s currency derivatives was approximately\n12\nmonths.\nCommodity Derivative Instruments\nAt December 31, 2021, a net gain of $\n3.5\nmillion, net of tax, was included in AOCI related to the fair market value of the Company's commodity derivatives designated as accounting hedges. A change in fair value of commodity derivative instruments deemed highly effective is included in AOCI and is reclassified to\nCost of goods sold\nin the period the purchase of the commodity impacts\nNet earnings\n. The amount expected to be reclassified into\nNet earnings\nover the next twelve months is a gain of $\n3.5\nmillion. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to\nNet earnings\nmay vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. At December 31, 2021, the Company has commodity contracts to hedge certain forecasted purchases over the next 12 months.\nThe Company had the following outstanding contracts to hedge forecasted commodity purchases:\nF-18\nOther Derivative Instruments\nPrior to 2015, the Company utilized forward-starting interest rate swaps and interest rate locks to manage interest rate exposure in periods prior to the anticipated issuance of certain fixed-rate debt. These instruments were designated as cash flow hedges and had a notional amount of $\n1.3\nbillion. Consequently, when the contracts were settled upon the issuance of the underlying debt, any realized gains or losses in the fair values of the instruments were deferred into AOCI. These deferred gains or losses are subsequently recognized in\nInterest expense\nover the term of the related notes. The net unrecognized gain in AOCI was $\n4.7\nmillion and $\n5.3\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and at December 31, 2020. The net deferred gain at December 31, 2021 will continue to be amortized over the term of notes with maturities ranging from 2023 to 2044. The amount expected to be amortized over the next twelve months is a net gain of $\n0.7\nmillion. The Company has\nno\nforward-starting interest rate swaps or interest rate lock contracts outstanding at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nThe following table represents the amounts associated with derivatives designated as hedges affecting\nNet earnings\nand AOCI for the years ended December 31:\n(1)\nAmounts excluded from effectiveness testing and recognized into\nCost of goods sold\nbased on changes in fair value and amortization was a loss of $\n0.7\nmillion,  $\n2.1\nmillion and $\n3.0\nmillion  for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021,\n2020 and 2019,\nrespectively.\nThe following table represents the amounts associated with derivatives not designated as hedges affecting\nNet earnings\nfor the years ended December 31:\nThe gains and losses associated with the Company’s undesignated currency derivatives are materially offset in\nNet earnings\nby changes in the fair value of the underlying transactions.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nThe counterparties to the Company’s forward contracts consist of a number of investment grade major international financial institutions. The Company could be exposed to losses in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties. However, the credit ratings and the concentration of risk in these financial institutions are monitored on a continuous basis and present no significant credit risk to the Company.\nNOTE 9.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC 820, \"Fair Value Measurement,\" (ASC 820) defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. ASC 820 also establishes a three-level fair value hierarchy that prioritizes information used in developing assumptions when pricing an asset or liability as follows:\n•\nLevel 1:\nObservable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;\n•\nLevel 2:\nInputs, other than quoted prices in active markets, that are observable either directly or indirectly; and\n•\nLevel 3:\nUnobservable inputs where there is little or no market data, which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions.\nASC 820 requires the use of observable market data, when available, in making fair value measurements. When inputs used to measure fair value fall within different levels of the hierarchy, the level within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement.\nF-19\nThe following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021:\nThe following table presents the Company’s fair value hierarchy for those assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2020:\nDerivative instruments include forward foreign currency contracts and instruments related to non-functional currency balance sheet exposures. The fair value of the derivative instruments are determined based on a pricing model that uses spot rates and forward prices from actively quoted currency markets that are readily accessible and observable. The fair value of the commodity derivatives is valued under a market approach using publicized prices, where applicable, or dealer quotes.\nEarnout payments related to acquisitions are measured at fair value each reporting period using Level 3 unobservable inputs.\nThe changes in the fair value of the Company's Level 3 liabilities during the year ended December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nThe fair value of the earnout payment is measured on a recurring basis at each reporting date.\nThe following inputs and assumptions were used in the Monte Carlo simulation model to estimate the fair value of the earnout payment at December 31, 2021:\nRefer to Note 18, \"Acquisitions and Divestitures\" for more information regarding the earnout payment\n.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable and accounts payable are a reasonable estimate of their fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments. There have been no transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nF-20\nNOTE 10.\nLEASES\nThe Company’s lease portfolio includes various contracts for real estate, vehicles, information technology and other equipment. At contract inception, the Company determines a lease exists if the contract conveys the right to control an identified asset for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control is considered to exist when the lessee has the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of an identified asset as well as the right to direct the use of that asset. If a contract is considered to be a lease, the Company recognizes a lease liability based on the present value of the future lease payments, with an offsetting entry to recognize a right-of-use asset. Options to extend or terminate a lease are included when it is reasonably certain an option will be exercised. As a majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate within the lease, an incremental borrowing rate is used which is based on information available at the commencement date.\nThe following table includes a summary of the Company's lease portfolio and Balance Sheet classification:\n(1)\nPrepaid lease payments and lease incentives are recorded as part of the right-of-use asset. The net impact was $\n6.5\nmillion and $\n6.3\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nThe Company accounts for each separate lease component of a contract and its associated non-lease component as a single lease component. In addition, the Company utilizes a portfolio approach for the vehicle, information technology and equipment asset classes as the application of the lease model to the portfolio would not differ materially from the application of the lease model to the individual leases within the portfolio.\nThe following table includes lease costs and related cash flow information for the year ended December 31:\nOperating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. In addition, the Company has certain leases that contain variable lease payments which are based on an index, a rate referenced in the lease or on the actual usage of the leased asset. These payments are not included in the right-of-use asset or lease liability and are expensed as incurred as variable lease expense.\nF-21\nMaturities of lease obligations were as follows:\nNOTE 11.\nPENSIONS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS\nThe Company sponsors several U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering substantially all of the Company's U.S. employees. Additionally, the Company has many non-U.S. defined benefit and defined contribution plans covering eligible non-U.S. employees. Postretirement benefits other than pensions (OPEB) provide healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits for certain eligible employees.\nPension Plans\nThe noncontributory defined benefit pension plans covering non-collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a final average pay formula while plans for most collectively bargained U.S. employees provide benefits on a flat dollar benefit formula or a percentage of pay formula. The non-U.S. pension plans generally provide benefits based on earnings and years of service. The Company also maintains additional other supplemental plans for officers and other key or highly compensated employees.\nIn connection with completion of the Transaction, the Company transferred certain pension obligations for current and former employees of Ingersoll Rand Industrial to Ingersoll Rand. The transfer of these obligations reduced pension liabilities by $\n486.2\nmillion, pension assets by $\n351.7\nmillion and AOCI by $\n111.3\nmillion.\nF-22\nThe following table details information regarding the Company’s pension plans at December 31:\n(1)\nActuarial (gains) losses primarily resulted from changes in discount rates\nIt is the Company’s objective to contribute to the pension plans to ensure adequate funds, and no less than required by law, are available in the plans to make benefit payments to plan participants and beneficiaries when required. However, certain plans are not or cannot be funded due to either legal, accounting, or tax requirements in certain jurisdictions. As of December 31, 2021, approximately\nseven\npercent of the Company's projected benefit obligation relates to plans that cannot be funded.\nThe pretax amounts recognized in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nwere as follows:\nF-23\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation at December 31 were as follows:\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n3,311.0\nmillion and $\n3,566.4\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The projected benefit obligation, accumulated benefit obligation, and fair value of plan assets for pension plans with accumulated benefit obligations more than plan assets were $\n2,906.5\nmillion, $\n2,831.5\nmillion and $\n2,424.6\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021, and $\n3,128.7\nmillion, $\n3,043.9\nmillion and $\n2,510.9\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\nPension benefit payments are expected to be paid as follows:\nThe components of the Company’s net periodic pension benefit costs for the years ended December 31 include the following:\nPension benefit cost for 2022 is projected to be approximately $\n57\nmillion.\nF-24\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic pension cost for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of returns expected on the funds invested or to be invested to provide for the benefits included in the projected benefit obligation. The expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is based on what is achievable given the plan’s investment policy, the types of assets held and target asset allocations. The expected long-term rate of return is determined as of the measurement date. The Company reviews each plan and its historical returns and target asset allocations to determine the appropriate expected long-term rate of return on plan assets to be used.\nThe Company's objective in managing its defined benefit plan assets is to ensure that all present and future benefit obligations are met as they come due. It seeks to achieve this goal while trying to mitigate volatility in plan funded status, contribution, and expense by better matching the characteristics of the plan assets to that of the plan liabilities. The Company utilizes a dynamic approach to asset allocation whereby a plan's allocation to fixed income assets increases as the plan's funded status improves. The Company monitors plan funded status and asset allocation regularly in addition to investment manager performance.\nF-25\nThe fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2021 by asset category were as follows:\nThe fair values of the Company’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2020 by asset category were as follows:\n(a)\nThis class includes state and municipal bonds.\n(b)\nThis class includes group annuity and guaranteed interest contracts.\n(c)\nThis class includes a private equity fund that invests in real estate.\n(d)\nThis investment comprises the Company's non-significant, non-US pension plan assets. It primarily includes insurance contracts.\nF-26\nCash equivalents are valued using a market approach with inputs including quoted market prices for either identical or similar instruments. Fixed income securities are valued through a market approach with inputs including, but not limited to, benchmark yields, reported trades, broker quotes and issuer spreads. Commingled funds are valued at their daily net asset value (NAV) per share or the equivalent. NAV per share or the equivalent is used for fair value purposes as a practical expedient. NAVs are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund. Private real estate fund values are reported by the fund manager and are based on valuation or appraisal of the underlying investments. Refer to Note 9, \"Fair Value Measurements\" for additional information related to the fair value hierarchy defined by ASC 820. There have been no significant transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy.\nThe Company made required and discretionary contributions to its pension plans of $\n55.9\nmillion in 2021, $\n99.7\nmillion in 2020, and $\n83.1\nmillion in 2019 and currently projects that it will contribute approximately $\n82\nmillion to its plans worldwide in 2022. The contribution in 2020 included $\n24.4\nmillion to fund Ingersoll Rand Industrial plans prior to the completion of the Transaction. The Company’s policy allows it to fund an amount, which could be in excess of or less than the pension cost expensed, subject to the limitations imposed by current tax regulations. However, the Company anticipates funding the plans in 2022 in accordance with contributions required by funding regulations or the laws of each jurisdiction.\nMost of the Company’s U.S. employees are covered by defined contribution plans. Employer contributions are determined based on criteria specific to the individual plans and amounted to approximately $\n125.8\nmillion, $\n111.0\nmillion and $\n140.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company’s contributions relating to non-U.S. defined contribution plans and other non-U.S. benefit plans were $\n34.9\nmillion, $\n19.2\nmillion and $\n56.7\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nThe Company also participates in a number of multiemployer defined benefit pension plans related to collectively bargained U.S. employees of Trane. The Company's contributions, and the administration of the fixed retirement payments, are determined by the terms of the related collective-bargaining agreements. These multiemployer plans pose different risks to the Company than single-employer plans, including:\n1.\nThe Company's contributions to multiemployer plans may be used to provide benefits to all participating employees of the program, including employees of other employers.\n2.\nIn the event that another participating employer ceases contributions to a plan, the Company may be responsible for any unfunded obligations along with the remaining participating employers.\n3.\nIf the Company chooses to withdraw from any of the multiemployer plans, the Company may be required to pay a withdrawal liability, based on the underfunded status of the plan.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company does not participate in any plans that are individually significant, nor is the Company an individually significant participant to any of these plans.\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\nThe Company sponsors several postretirement plans that provide for healthcare benefits, and in some instances, life insurance benefits that cover certain eligible employees. These plans are unfunded and have no plan assets, but are instead funded by the Company on a pay-as-you-go basis in the form of direct benefit payments. Generally, postretirement health benefits are contributory with contributions adjusted annually. Life insurance plans for retirees are primarily noncontributory.\nIn connection with the completion of the Transaction, the Company transferred certain postretirement benefit obligations for current and former employees of Ingersoll Rand Industrial to Ingersoll Rand. The transfer of these obligations reduced postretirement plan liabilities by $\n28.7\nmillion and increased AOCI by $\n5.5\nmillion.\nF-27\nThe following table details changes in the Company’s postretirement plan benefit obligations for the years ended December 31:\n(1)\nNet actuarial losses primarily resulted from losses driven by changes in discount rates offset by gains driven by changes in per capita cost assumptions.\n(2)\nAmounts are net of Medicare Part D subsidy of $\n0.5\nmillion and $\n0.7\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe benefit plan obligations are reflected in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows:\nThe pre-tax amounts recognized in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nwere as follows:\nThe components of net periodic postretirement benefit (income) cost for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nPostretirement cost for 2022 is projected to be approximately $\n3\nmillion. The amount expected to be recognized in net periodic postretirement benefits cost in 2022 for net actuarial gains is approximately $\n6\nmillion.\nF-28\nWeighted-average assumptions used to determine net periodic benefit cost for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nBenefit payments for postretirement benefits, which are net of expected plan participant contributions and Medicare Part D subsidy, are expected to be paid as follows:\nNOTE 12.\nREVENUE\nThe Company recognizes revenue when control of a good or service promised in a contract (i.e., performance obligation) is transferred to a customer. Control is obtained when a customer has the ability to direct the use of and obtain substantially all of the remaining benefits from that good or service. A majority of the Company's revenues are recognized at a point-in-time as control is transferred at a distinct point in time per the terms of a contract. However, a portion of the Company's revenues are recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives control as the Company performs work under a contract. For these arrangements, the cost-to-cost input method is used as it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer that occurs as the Company incurs costs.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a distinct good, service or a bundle of goods and services promised in a contract. The Company identifies performance obligations at the inception of a contract and allocates the transaction price to individual performance obligations to faithfully depict the Company’s performance in transferring control of the promised goods or services to the customer.\nThe following are the primary performance obligations identified by the Company:\nEquipment\n. The Company principally generates revenue from the sale of equipment to customers and recognizes revenue at a point in time when control transfers to the customer. Transfer of control is generally determined based on the shipping terms of the contract.\nContracting and installation\n. The Company enters into various construction-type contracts to design, deliver and build integrated solutions to meet customer specifications. These transactions provide services that range from the development and installation of new HVAC systems to the design and integration of critical building systems to optimize energy efficiency and overall performance. These contracts have a typical term of less than one year and are considered a single performance obligation as multiple combined goods and services promised in the contract represent a single output delivered to the customer. Revenues associated with contracting and installation contracts are recognized over time with progress towards completion measured using an input method as the basis to recognize revenue and an estimated profit. To-date efforts for work performed corresponds with and faithfully depicts transfer of control to the customer.\nF-29\nServices and maintenance\n. The Company provides various levels of preventative and/or repair and maintenance type service agreements for its customers. The typical length of a contract is 12 months but can be as long as 60 months. Revenues associated with these performance obligations are primarily recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by the Company. However, if historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services on a straight-line basis is not appropriate, revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred while performing the service. Revenues for certain repair services that do not meet the criteria for over time revenue recognition and sales of parts are recognized at a point in time.\nExtended warranties\n. The Company enters into various warranty contracts with customers related to its products. A standard warranty generally warrants that a product is free from defects in workmanship and materials under normal use and conditions for a certain period of time. The Company’s standard warranty is not considered a distinct performance obligation as it does not provide services to customers beyond assurance that the covered product is free of initial defects. An extended warranty provides a customer with additional time that the Company is liable for covered incidents associated with its products. Extended warranties are purchased separately and can last up to five years. As a result, they are considered separate performance obligations for the Company. Revenue associated with these performance obligations is primarily recognized over time on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefit provided by the Company. However, if historical evidence indicates that the cost of providing these services on a straight-line basis is not appropriate, revenue is recognized over the contract period in proportion to the costs expected to be incurred while performing the service. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for more information related to product warranties.\nThe transaction price allocated to performance obligations reflects the Company’s expectations about the consideration it will be entitled to receive from a customer. To determine the transaction price, variable and noncash consideration are assessed as well as whether a significant financing component exists. The Company includes variable consideration in the estimated transaction price when it is probable that significant reversal of revenue recognized would not occur when the uncertainty associated with variable consideration is subsequently resolved. The Company considers historical data in determining its best estimates of variable consideration, and the related accruals are recorded using the expected value method. The Company has performance guarantees related to energy savings contracts that are provided under the maintenance portion of contracting and installation agreements extending from 2022-2048. These performance guarantees represent variable consideration and are estimated as part of the overall transaction price. The Company has not recognized any significant adjustments to the transaction price due to variable consideration.\nThe Company enters into sales arrangements that contain multiple goods and services. For these arrangements, each good or service is evaluated to determine whether it represents a distinct performance obligation and whether the sales price for each obligation is representative of standalone selling price. If available, the Company utilizes observable prices for goods or services sold separately to similar customers in similar circumstances to evaluate relative standalone selling price. List prices are used if they are determined to be representative of standalone selling prices. Where necessary, the Company ensures that the total transaction price is then allocated to the distinct performance obligations based on the determination of their relative standalone selling price at the inception of the arrangement.\nThe Company recognizes revenue for delivered goods or services when the delivered good or service is distinct, control of the good or service has transferred to the customer, and only customary refund or return rights related to the goods or services exist. The Company excludes from revenues taxes it collects from a customer that are assessed by a government authority.\nF-30\nDisaggregated Revenue\nNet revenues\nby geography and major type of good or service for the year ended at December 31 were as follows:\nRevenue from goods and services transferred to customers at a point in time accounted for approximately\n82\n%,\n81\n% and\n82\n% of the Company's revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nContract Balances\nThe opening and closing balances of contract assets and contract liabilities arising from contracts with customers for the period ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:\nThe timing of revenue recognition, billings and cash collections results in accounts receivable, contract assets, and customer advances and deposits (contract liabilities) on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In general, the Company receives payments from customers based on a billing schedule established in its contracts. Contract assets relate to the conditional right to consideration for any completed performance under the contract when costs are incurred in excess of billings under the percentage-of-completion methodology. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract liabilities relate to payments received in advance of performance under the contract or when the Company has a right to consideration that is unconditional before it transfers a good or service to the customer. Contract liabilities are recognized as revenue as (or when) the Company performs under the contract. During the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, changes in contract asset and liability balances were not materially impacted by any other factors.\nApproximately\n49\n% of the contract liability balance at December 31, 2020 was recognized as revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021. Additionally, approximately\n36\n% of the contract liability balance at December 31, 2021 was classified as noncurrent and not expected to be recognized as revenue in the next 12 months.\nF-31\nNOTE 13.\nEQUITY\nThe authorized share capital of Trane Technologies plc is\n1,185,040,000\nshares, consisting of (1)\n1,175,000,000\nordinary shares, par value $\n1.00\nper share, (2)\n40,000\nordinary shares, par value EUR\n1.00\nand (3)\n10,000,000\npreference shares, par value $\n0.001\nper share. There were\nno\npreference shares or Euro-denominated ordinary shares outstanding at December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nThe changes in ordinary shares and treasury shares for the year ended December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nShare repurchases are made from time to time in accordance with management's capital allocation strategy, subject to market conditions and regulatory requirements. Shares acquired and canceled upon repurchase are accounted for as a reduction of\nOrdinary Shares\nand\nCapital in excess of par value\n, or\nRetained earnings\nto the extent\nCapital in excess of par value\nis exhausted. Shares acquired and held in treasury are presented separately on the balance sheet as a reduction to\nEquity\nand recognized at cost.\nIn February 2021, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $\n2.0\nbillion of its ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program (2021 Authorization) upon completion of the prior share repurchase program which authorized the repurchase of up to $\n1.5\nbillion of its ordinary shares (2018 Authorization). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company repurchased and canceled $\n1.1\nbillion of its ordinary shares thus completing the 2018 Authorization and initiated repurchases under the 2021 Authorization of $\n600.2\nmillion of its ordinary shares leaving approximately $\n1.4\nbillion remaining under the 2021 Authorization as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, through January 31, 2022, we repurchased approximately $\n350\nmillion of our ordinary shares under the 2021 Authorization. In February 2022, the Company's Board of Directors authorized the repurchase of up to $\n3.0\nbillion of its ordinary shares under a new share repurchase program (2022 Authorization) upon completion of the 2021 Authorization.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nThe changes in\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss)\nwere as follows:\nThe amounts of\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nfor 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $(\n1.7\n) million, $\n2.7\nmillion and $\n0.9\nmillion, respectively, related to currency translation. Additionally,\nOther comprehensive income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests\nfor 2021 includes $\n1.2\nmillion related to pension and postretirement obligation adjustments.\nF-32\nNOTE 14.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company accounts for stock-based compensation plans under the fair-value based method. Fair value is measured once at the date of grant and is not adjusted for subsequent changes. The Company’s share-based compensation plans include programs for stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs), performance share units (PSUs), and deferred compensation. Under the Company's incentive stock plan, the total number of ordinary shares authorized by the shareholders is\n23.0\nmillion, of which\n13.7\nmillion remains available as of December 31, 2021 for future incentive awards.\nIn connection with the completion of the Transaction, the provisions of the Company's existing share-based compensation plans required adjustment to the terms of outstanding awards in order to preserve the intrinsic value of the awards immediately before and after the separation. The outstanding awards will continue to vest over the original vesting period, which is generally three years from the grant date. At the Distribution Date, the Company incurred less than $\n0.1\nmillion of incremental compensation costs related to the preservation of the stock-based compensation intrinsic value post-separation.\nCompensation Expense\nShare-based compensation expense related to continuing operations is included in\nSelling and administrative expenses\n.\nThe following table summarizes the expenses recognized:\n(1)\nIncludes certain plans that have a market-based component.\nGrants issued during the year ended December 31 were as follows:\n(1)\nThe number of performance shares represents the maximum award level.\nF-33\nStock Options / RSUs\nEligible participants may receive (i) stock options, (ii) RSUs or (iii) a combination of both stock options and RSUs. The fair value of each of the Company’s stock option and RSU awards is expensed on a straight-line basis over the required service period, which is generally the\n3\n-year vesting period. However, for stock options and RSUs granted to retirement eligible employees, the Company recognizes expense for the fair value at the grant date.\nThe average fair value of the stock options granted is determined using the Black Scholes option pricing model.\nThe following assumptions were used during the year ended December 31:\nA description of the significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the stock option awards is as follows:\n•\nDividend yield\n- The Company determines the dividend yield based upon the expected quarterly dividend payments as of the grant date and the current fair market value of the Company’s stock.\n•\nVolatility\n- The expected volatility is based on a weighted average of the Company’s implied volatility and the most recent historical volatility of the Company’s stock commensurate with the expected life.\n•\nRisk-free rate of return\n-The Company applies a yield curve of continuous risk-free rates based upon the published US Treasury spot rates on the grant date.\n•\nExpected life\nin years\n- The expected life of the Company’s stock option awards represents the weighted-average of the actual period since the grant date for all exercised or canceled options and an expected period for all outstanding options.\nChanges in options outstanding under the plans for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nF-34\nThe following table summarizes information concerning currently outstanding and exercisable options:\nAt December 31, 2021, there was $\n8.5\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost from stock option arrangements granted under the plan, which is primarily related to unvested shares of non-retirement eligible employees. The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n212.6\nmillion and $\n120.5\nmillion, respectively. Generally, stock options expire ten years from their date of grant.\nThe following table summarizes RSU activity for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nAt December 31, 2021, there was $\n12.5\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost from RSU arrangements granted under the plan, which is related to unvested shares of non-retirement eligible employees.\nF-35\nPerformance Shares\nThe Company has a Performance Share Program (PSP) for key employees. The program provides awards in the form of PSUs based on performance against pre-established objectives. The annual target award level is expressed as a number of the Company's ordinary shares based on the fair market value of the Company's stock on the date of grant. All PSUs are settled in the form of ordinary shares.\nBeginning with the 2018 grant year, PSU awards are earned based\n50\n% upon a performance condition, measured by relative Cash Flow Return on Invested Capital (CROIC) to the S&P 500 Industrials Index over a 3-year performance period, and\n50\n% upon a market condition, measured by the Company's relative total shareholder return (TSR) as compared to the TSR of the S&P 500 Industrials Index over a\n3\n-year performance period. The fair value of the market condition is estimated using a Monte Carlo simulation model in a risk-neutral framework based upon historical volatility, risk-free rates and correlation matrix. Awards granted prior to 2018 were earned based\n50\n% upon a performance condition, measured by relative earnings-per-share (EPS) growth to the S&P 500 Industrials Index over a\n3\n-year performance period, and\n50\n% upon a market condition measured by the Company's relative TSR as compared to the TSR of the S&P 500 Industrials Index over a\n3\n-year performance period.\nThe following table summarizes PSU activity for the maximum number of shares that may be issued for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nAt December 31, 2021, there was $\n17.4\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost from PSU arrangements based on current performance, which is related to unvested shares. This compensation will be recognized over the required service period, which is generally the three-year vesting period.\nDeferred Compensation\nThe Company allows key employees to defer a portion of their eligible compensation into a number of investment choices, including its ordinary share equivalents. Any amounts invested in ordinary share equivalents will be settled in ordinary shares of the Company at the time of distribution.\nF-36\nNOTE 15.\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\nThe Company incurs costs associated with restructuring initiatives intended to result in improved operating performance, profitability and working capital levels. Actions associated with these initiatives include workforce reduction, improving manufacturing productivity, realignment of management structures and rationalizing certain assets.\nRestructuring charges recorded during the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nThe changes in the restructuring reserve were as follows:\n(1)\nExcludes the accelerated depreciation on equipment ($\n4.0\nmillion).\n(2)\nExcludes the accelerated depreciation on buildings and equipment and other non-cash charges ($\n1.3\nmillion).\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, costs associated with announced restructuring actions primarily included the following:\n•\ncosts related to workforce reductions and the reorganization of resources in an effort to improve the Company's cost structure and other functional transformation initiatives;\n•\nthe plan to close a U.S. manufacturing facility and relocate production to another existing U.S. facility announced in 2018; and\n•\ncosts related to the reorganization of resources and facilities in response to the completion of the Transaction and separation of Ingersoll Rand Industrial.\nAmounts recognized primarily relate to severance and exit costs. In addition, the Company also includes costs that are directly attributable to the restructuring activity but do not fall into the severance, exit or disposal categories. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n16.7\nmillion accrued for costs associated with its ongoing restructuring actions, of which a majority is expected to be paid within one year.\nF-37\nNOTE 16.  OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET\nThe components of\nOther income/(expense), net\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nOther income/(expense), net\nincludes the results from activities other than normal business operations such as interest income and foreign currency gains and losses on transactions that are denominated in a currency other than an entity’s functional currency. In addition, the Company includes the components of net periodic benefit credit/(cost) for pension and post retirement obligations other than the service cost component. Other activity, net primarily includes items associated with certain legal matters, as well as asbestos-related activities. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded a gain of $\n12.8\nmillion related to the release of a pension indemnification liability, partially offset by a charge of $\n7.2\nmillion to increase its Funding Agreement liability from asbestos-related activities of Murray within other activity, net. Other activity, net for the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily includes a $\n17.4\nmillion adjustment to correct an overstatement of a legacy legal liability that originated in prior years and a gain of $\n0.9\nmillion related to the deconsolidation of Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs within other activity, net. Refer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for more information regarding asbestos-related matters.\nNOTE 17.\nINCOME TAXES\nCurrent and deferred provision for income taxes\nEarnings before income taxes\nfor the years ended December 31 were taxed within the following jurisdictions:\nThe components of the\nProvision for income taxes\nfor the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nF-38\nThe\nProvision for income taxes\ndiffers from the amount of income taxes determined by applying the applicable U.S. statutory income tax rate to pretax income, as a result of the following differences:\n(a)\nNet of foreign tax credits\n(b)\nNet of changes in state valuation allowances\n(c)\nPrimarily federal and non-U.S., excludes state valuation allowances\nTax incentives, in the form of tax holidays, have been granted to the Company in certain jurisdictions to encourage industrial development. The expiration of these tax holidays varies by country. The tax holidays are conditional on the Company meeting certain employment and investment thresholds. The most significant tax holidays relate to the Company’s qualifying locations in China, Puerto Rico and Panama. The benefit for the tax holidays for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n32.6\nmillion, $\n24.6\nmillion and $\n28.3\nmillion, respectively.\nF-39\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities\nA summary of the deferred tax accounts at December 31 were as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, no deferred taxes have been provided for earnings of certain of the Company’s subsidiaries, since these earnings have been and under current plans will continue to be permanently reinvested in these subsidiaries. These earnings amount to approximately $\n2.5\nbillion which if distributed would result in additional taxes, which may be payable upon distribution, of approximately $\n300.0\nmillion.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had the following operating loss, capital loss and tax credit carryforwards available to offset taxable income in prior and future years:\nThe U.S. state net operating loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions. The non-U.S. net operating loss carryforwards were incurred in various jurisdictions, predominantly in Belgium, Brazil, India, Luxembourg, Spain and the United Kingdom.\nF-40\nActivity associated with the Company’s valuation allowance is as follows:\nDuring 2021, the Company recorded a $\n21.4\nmillion reduction in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to foreign tax credits as a result of an increase in current year foreign source income.\nDuring 2020, the Company recorded a $\n22.3\nmillion increase in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to certain state net deferred tax assets as a result of the Transaction. In addition, the Company recorded a $\n16.0\nmillion reduction in valuation allowances related to non-U.S. net operating losses, primarily as a result of a planned restructuring in a non-U.S. tax jurisdiction, and foreign tax credits as a result of revised projections of future foreign source income.\nDuring 2019, the Company recorded a $\n43.6\nmillion reduction in valuation allowance on deferred tax assets primarily related to\nnon-U.S. net operating losses. In addition, the Company recorded a $\n19.3\nmillion increase in a valuation allowance for certain state net deferred tax assets as a result of revised projections of future state taxable income during the carryforward period.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nThe Company has total unrecognized tax benefits of $\n65.2\nmillion and $\n65.4\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the continuing operations effective tax rate are $\n39.1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe Company records interest and penalties associated with the uncertain tax positions within its\nProvision for income taxes\n. The Company had reserves associated with interest and penalties, net of tax, of $\n7.1\nmillion and $\n14.6\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. For the year ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, the Company recognized a $\n0.7\nmillion and $\n0.1\nmillion tax expense, respectively, in interest and penalties, net of tax in continuing operations related to these uncertain tax positions.\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits relating to the Company's tax positions is subject to change based on future events including, but not limited to, the settlements of ongoing audits and/or the expiration of applicable statutes of limitations. Although the outcomes and timing of such events are highly uncertain, it is reasonably possible that the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, could potentially be reduced by up to approximately $\n3.2\nmillion during the next\n12\nmonths.\nF-41\nThe provision for income taxes involves a significant amount of management judgment regarding interpretation of relevant facts and laws in the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. Future changes in applicable laws, projected levels of taxable income and tax planning could change the effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company. In addition, tax authorities periodically review income tax returns filed by the Company and can raise issues regarding its filing positions, timing and amount of income or deductions, and the allocation of income among the jurisdictions in which the Company operates. A significant period of time may elapse between the filing of an income tax return and the ultimate resolution of an issue raised by a revenue authority with respect to that return. In the normal course of business the Company is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world, including such major jurisdictions as Belgium, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Mexico, Spain, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom and the United States. These examinations on their own, or any subsequent litigation related to the examinations, may result in additional taxes or penalties against the Company. If the ultimate result of these audits differ from original or adjusted estimates, they could have a material impact on the Company’s tax provision. In general, the examination of the Company’s U.S. federal tax returns is complete or effectively settled for years prior to 2016. In general, the examination of the Company’s material non-U.S. tax returns is complete or effectively settled for the years prior to 2013, with certain matters prior to 2013 being resolved through appeals and litigation and also unilateral procedures as provided for under double tax treaties.\nIn connection with the Transaction, the Company and Ingersoll Rand entered into a tax sharing agreement for the allocation of taxes. The Company has an indemnity payable to Ingersoll Rand, included within other non-current liabilities, in the amount of $\n8.0\nmillion of tax and interest primarily related to open audit years in non-U.S. tax jurisdictions.\nNOTE 18.\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES\nAcquisitions\nOn October 15, 2021, the Company acquired 100% of Farrar Scientific Corporation's (Farrar Scientific) assets, including its patented ultra-low temperature control technologies, a development and assembly operation in Marietta, Ohio, and a specialized team of engineers, sales engineers, operators, and technicians. Farrar Scientific is a leader in ultra-low temperature control for biopharmaceutical and other life science applications. The results of Farrar Scientific are reported within the Americas segment from the date of acquisition.\nThe Company paid $\n251.2\nmillion in initial cash consideration, financed through cash on hand, and agreed to contingent consideration relating to an earnout payment of up to $\n115.0\nmillion to be paid in 2025, tied to the attainment of key revenue targets during the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024. This additional payment, to the extent earned, will be payable in cash. The purchase price for the acquisition was expected to be $\n349.9\nmillion, comprised of the upfront cash consideration of $\n251.2\nmillion paid on October 15, 2021 and the fair value of the earnout payment at the time of closing the acquisition of $\n98.7\nmillion. The fair value of the earnout payment is determined using the Monte Carlo simulation model based on projections of revenues for Farrar Scientific during the period of January 1, 2022 through December 31, 2024, implied revenue volatility and a risk adjusted discount rate. Each quarter the Company is required to remeasure the fair value of the liability as assumptions change and such adjustments will be recorded in\nSelling and administrative expenses\nin the Consolidated Statements of Earnings. As of  December 31, 2021, the fair value of the earnout payment was $\n96.2\nmillion.\nThe aggregate purchase price has been allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on the estimate of fair market value of such assets and liabilities at the date of acquisition. Intangible assets associated with the acquisition totaled $\n140.7\nmillion and primarily relate to customer relationships. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and totaled $\n203.6\nmillion.\nThe Company recorded intangible assets based on their preliminary estimate of fair value, which consisted of the following:\nF-42\nThe valuation of intangible assets was determined using an income approach methodology. The fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method based on discounted projected net cash flows associated with the net earnings attributable to the acquired customer relationships. These projected cash flows are estimated over the remaining economic life of the intangible asset and are considered from a market participant perspective. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth rates and customer attrition rates. The projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. Any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets was recognized as goodwill. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the fair value of market share and revenue growth from Farrar Scientific. The benefit of access to the workforce is an additional element of goodwill. For income tax purposes, the acquisition was an asset purchase and the goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes. The Company has not included pro forma financial information as the pro forma impact was deemed not material.\nDuring 2020, the Company acquired two independent dealers, reported within the Americas segment, to support the Company's ongoing strategy to expand its distribution network and service area. The aggregate cash paid, net of cash acquired, totaled $\n182.8\nmillion and was financed through cash on hand. Intangible assets associated with these acquisitions totaled $\n76.9\nmillion and primarily relate to customer relationships. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and totaled $\n131.8\nmillion.\nThe fair values of the customer relationship intangible assets were determined using the multi-period excess earnings method based on discounted projected net cash flows associated with the net earnings attributable to the acquired customer relationships. These projected cash flows are estimated over the remaining economic life of the intangible asset and are considered from a market participant perspective. Key assumptions used in estimating future cash flows included projected revenue growth rates and customer attrition rates. The projected future cash flows are discounted to present value using an appropriate discount rate. The customer relationships had a weighted-average useful life of\n16\nyears. The Company has not included pro forma financial information as the pro forma impact was deemed not material.\nDuring 2019, the Company acquired several businesses including independent dealers to support its ongoing strategy to expand its distribution network and service area as well as other businesses that strengthen the Company's product portfolios. The aggregate cash paid, net of cash acquired, totaled $\n83.4\nmillion and was funded through cash on hand. Intangible assets associated with these acquisitions totaled $\n25.5\nmillion and primarily relate to trademarks and customer relationships. The excess purchase price over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired was recognized as goodwill and totaled $\n45.3\nmillion. These acquisitions were not material to the Company's financial statements and were reported in the Americas segment.\nDivestitures\nThe components of\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\nfor the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nThe table above presents the financial statement line items that support amounts included in\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\n. For the year ended December 31, 2021,\nOther income/(expense), net\nincluded a charge of $\n14.0\nmillion to increase the Company's Funding Agreement liability from asbestos-related activities of Aldrich as well as pension and post retirement obligations and environmental costs related to businesses formerly owned by the Company. For the year ended December 31, 2020,\nSelling and administrative expenses\nincluded pre-tax Ingersoll Rand Industrial separation costs of $\n114.2\nmillion, which are primarily related to legal, consulting and advisory fees. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2020\n, Other income/ (expense), net\nincluded a loss of $\n25.8\nmillion related to the deconsolidation of Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park. The year ended December 31, 2019\nincluded $\n94.6\nmillion of pre-tax Ingersoll Rand Industrial separation costs within\nSelling and administrative expenses\n.\nF-43\nSeparation of Industrial Segment Businesses\nOn February 29, 2020, the Company completed the Transaction with Ingersoll Rand whereby the Company separated Ingersoll Rand Industrial which then merged with a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ingersoll Rand. In accordance with GAAP, the historical results of Ingersoll Rand Industrial are presented as a discontinued operation in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings and Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nNet revenues\nand earnings from operations, net of tax of Ingersoll Rand Industrial for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nEarnings (loss) attributable to Trane Technologies plc\nincludes Ingersoll Rand Industrial separation costs, net of tax primarily related to legal, consulting and advisory fees of $\n96.2\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020. In addition, the year ended December 31, 2019 includes $\n89.4\nmillion of Ingersoll Rand Industrial separation costs, net of tax.\nOther Discontinued Operations\nOther discontinued operations, net of tax related to retained obligations from previously sold businesses that primarily include ongoing expenses for postretirement benefits, product liability and legal costs. In addition, the Company includes asbestos-related activities of Aldrich.\nThe components of\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\nfor the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nRefer to Note 21, \"Commitments and Contingencies,\" for more information regarding the deconsolidation and asbestos-related matters.\nNOTE 19.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)\nBasic EPS is calculated by dividing\nNet earnings attributable to Trane Technologies plc\nby the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the applicable period. Diluted EPS is calculated after adjusting the denominator of the basic EPS calculation for the effect of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares, which in the Company’s case, includes shares issuable under share-based compensation plans.\nThe following table summarizes the weighted-average number of ordinary shares outstanding for basic and diluted earnings per share calculations:\nF-44\nNOTE 20.\nBUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company operates under three regional operating segments designed to create deep customer focus and relevance in markets around the world. Intercompany sales between segments are immaterial.\n•\nThe Company's Americas segment innovates for customers in North America and Latin America. The Americas segment encompasses commercial heating and cooling systems, building controls, and energy services and solutions; residential heating and cooling; and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\n•\nThe Company's EMEA segment innovates for customers in the Europe, Middle East and Africa region. The EMEA segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and industrial processing, and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\n•\nThe Company's Asia Pacific segment innovates for customers throughout the Asia Pacific region. The Asia Pacific segment encompasses heating and cooling systems, services and solutions for commercial buildings and transport refrigeration systems and solutions.\nManagement measures operating performance based on net earnings excluding interest expense, income taxes, depreciation and amortization, restructuring, unallocated corporate expenses and discontinued operations (Segment Adjusted EBITDA). Segment Adjusted EBITDA is not defined under GAAP and may not be comparable to similarly-titled measures used by other companies and should not be considered a substitute for net earnings or other results reported in accordance with GAAP. The Company believes Segment Adjusted EBITDA provides the most relevant measure of profitability as well as earnings power and the ability to generate cash. This measure is a useful financial metric to assess the Company's operating performance from period to period by excluding certain items that it believes are not representative of its core business and the Company uses this measure for business planning purposes. Segment Adjusted EBITDA also provides a useful tool for assessing the comparability between periods and the Company's ability to generate cash from operations sufficient to pay taxes, to service debt and to undertake capital expenditures because it eliminates non-cash charges such as depreciation and amortization expense.\nF-45\nA summary of operations by reportable segment for the years ended December 31 were as follows:\nAt December 31, a summary of long-lived assets by geographic area were as follows:\nF-46\nNOTE 21.\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nThe Company is involved in various litigation, claims and administrative proceedings, including those related to the bankruptcy proceedings for Aldrich and Murray and environmental and product liability matters. The Company records accruals for loss contingencies when it is both probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. Amounts recorded for identified contingent liabilities are estimates, which are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional information when it becomes available. Subject to the uncertainties inherent in estimating future costs for contingent liabilities, except as expressly set forth in this note, management believes that any liability which may result from these legal matters would not have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, results of operations, liquidity or cash flows of the Company.\nAsbestos-Related Matters\nCertain wholly-owned subsidiaries and former companies of the Company were named as defendants in asbestos-related lawsuits in state and federal courts. In virtually all of the suits, a large number of other companies have also been named as defendants. The vast majority of those claims were filed against predecessors of Aldrich and Murray and generally allege injury caused by exposure to asbestos contained in certain historical products sold by predecessors of Aldrich or Murray, primarily pumps, boilers and railroad brake shoes. None of the Company's existing or previously-owned businesses were a producer or manufacturer of asbestos.\nOn June 18, 2020, Aldrich and Murray filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray. As a result of the Chapter 11 filings, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich and Murray have been stayed due to the imposition of a statutory automatic stay applicable in Chapter 11 bankruptcy cases. In addition, at the request of Aldrich and Murray, the Bankruptcy Court has entered an order temporarily staying all asbestos-related claims against the Trane Companies that relate to claims against Aldrich or Murray (except for asbestos-related claims for which the exclusive remedy is provided under workers' compensation statutes or similar laws). On August 23, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered its findings of facts and conclusions of law and order declaring that the automatic stay applies to certain asbestos related claims against the Trane Companies and enjoining such actions. As a result, all asbestos-related lawsuits against Aldrich, Murray and the Trane Companies remain stayed.\nThe goal of these Chapter 11 filings is to resolve equitably and permanently all current and future asbestos-related claims in a manner beneficial to claimants, Aldrich and Murray through court approval of a plan of reorganization that would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future asbestos-related claims against Aldrich and Murray and channel such claims to the trust for resolution in accordance with those procedures. Aldrich and Murray intend to seek an agreement with representatives of the asbestos claimants on the terms of a plan for the establishment of such a trust.\nPrior to the Petition Date, predecessors of each of Aldrich and Murray had been litigating asbestos-related claims brought against them. No such claims have been paid since the Petition Date, and it is not contemplated that any such claims will be paid until the end of the Chapter 11 cases.\nFrom an accounting perspective, the Company no longer has control over Aldrich and Murray as of the Petition Date as their activities are subject to review and oversight by the Bankruptcy Court. Therefore, Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park and Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs were deconsolidated as of the Petition Date and their respective assets and liabilities were derecognized from the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements. Amounts derecognized in 2020 primarily related to the legacy asbestos-related liabilities and asbestos-related insurance recoveries and $\n41.7\nmillion of cash.\nAccounting Treatment Prior to the Petition Date\nHistorically, the Company performed a detailed analysis and projected an estimated range of the Company’s total liability for pending and unasserted future asbestos-related claims. The Company recorded the liability at the low end of the range as it believed that no amount within the range was a better estimate than any other amount. Asbestos-related defense costs were excluded from the liability and were recorded separately as services were incurred. The methodology used to prepare estimates relied upon and included the following factors, among others:\n•\nthe interpretation of a widely accepted forecast of the population likely to have been occupationally exposed to asbestos;\n•\nepidemiological studies estimating the number of people likely to develop asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer;\n•\nthe Company’s historical experience with the filing of non-malignancy claims and claims alleging other types of malignant diseases filed against the Company relative to the number of lung cancer claims filed against the Company;\nF-47\n•\nthe analysis of the number of people likely to file an asbestos-related personal injury claim against the Company based on such epidemiological and historical data and the Company’s claims history;\n•\nan analysis of the Company’s pending cases, by type of disease claimed and by year filed;\n•\nan analysis of the Company’s history to determine the average settlement and resolution value of claims, by type of disease claimed;\n•\nan adjustment for inflation in the future average settlement value of claims, at a\n2.5\n% annual inflation rate, adjusted downward to\n1.0\n% to take account of the declining value of claims resulting from the aging of the claimant population; and\n•\nan analysis of the period over which the Company has and is likely to resolve asbestos-related claims against it in the future (currently projected through 2053).\nPrior to the Petition Date, over\n73\npercent of the open and active claims against the Company were non-malignant or unspecified disease claims. In addition, the Company had a number of claims which had been placed on inactive or deferred dockets and expected to have little or no settlement value against the Company.\nPrior to the Petition Date, the costs associated with the settlement and defense of asbestos-related claims, insurance settlements on asbestos-related matters and the revaluation of the Company's liability for potential future claims and recoveries were included in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings within continuing operations or discontinued operations depending on the business to which they relate. Income and expenses associated with asbestos-related matters of Aldrich and its predecessors were recorded within discontinued operations as they related to previously divested businesses, primarily Ingersoll-Dresser Pump, which was sold by the Company in 2000. Income and expenses associated with asbestos-related matters for Murray and its predecessors were recorded within continuing operations. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes a $\n17.4\nmillion adjustment to correct an overstatement of a legacy legal liability that originated in prior years.\nThe net income (expense) associated with these pre-Petition Date transactions for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019  were as follows:\nThe amounts recorded by the Company for asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets are based on currently available information. Key assumptions underlying the estimated asbestos-related liabilities include the number of people occupationally exposed and likely to develop asbestos-related diseases such as mesothelioma and lung cancer, the number of people likely to file an asbestos-related personal injury claim against the Company, the average settlement and resolution of each claim and the percentage of claims resolved with no payment. Furthermore, predictions with respect to estimates of the liability are subject to greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens. Other factors that may affect the Company’s liability include uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case, reforms that may be made by state and federal courts, and the passage of state or federal tort reform legislation.\nThe aggregate amount of the stated limits in insurance policies available to Aldrich and Murray for asbestos-related claims acquired, over many years and from many different carriers, is substantial. However, as a result of limitations in that coverage, the projected total liability to claimants substantially exceeds the probable insurance recovery.\nAccounting Treatment After the Petition Date\nUpon deconsolidation in 2020, the Company recorded its retained interest in Aldrich and Murray at fair value within\nOther noncurrent assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet. In determining the fair value of its equity investment, the Company used a market-adjusted multiple of earnings valuation technique. As a result, the Company recorded an aggregate equity investment of $\n53.6\nmillion as of the Petition Date.\nSimultaneously, the Company recognized a liability of $\n248.8\nmillion within\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheet related to its obligation under the Funding Agreements. The liability was based on asbestos-related liabilities and insurance-related assets balances previously recorded by the Company prior to the Petition Date.\nF-48\nAs a result of the deconsolidation, the Company recognized an aggregate loss of $\n24.9\nmillion in its Consolidated Statements of Earnings during the year ended December 31, 2020. A gain of $\n0.9\nmillion related to Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs was recorded within\nOther income/ (expense), net\nand a loss of $\n25.8\nmillion related to Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park was recorded within\nDiscontinued operations, net of tax\n. Additionally, the deconsolidation resulted in an investing cash outflow of $\n41.7\nmillion in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, of which $\n10.8\nmillion was recorded within continuing operations during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOn August 26, 2021, the Company announced that Aldrich and Murray reached an agreement in principle with the court-appointed legal representative of future asbestos claimants (the FCR) in the bankruptcy proceedings. The agreement in principle includes the key terms for the permanent resolution of all current and future asbestos claims against Aldrich and Murray pursuant to a plan of reorganization (the Plan). Under the agreed terms, the Plan would create a trust pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code and establish claims resolution procedures for all current and future claims against Aldrich and Murray (Asbestos Claims). On the effective date of the Plan, Aldrich and Murray would fund the trust with $\n545.0\nmillion, comprised of $\n540.0\nmillion in cash and a promissory note to be issued by Aldrich and Murray to the trust in the principal amount of $\n5.0\nmillion, and the Asbestos Claims would be channeled to the trust for resolution in accordance with the claims resolution procedures. Following the effective date of the Plan, Aldrich and Murray, would have no further obligations with respect to the Asbestos Claims. The FCR has agreed to support such Plan. The agreement in principle with the FCR is subject to final documentation and is conditioned on arrangements acceptable to Aldrich and Murray with respect to their asbestos insurance assets. It is currently contemplated that the asbestos insurance assets of Aldrich and Murray would be contributed to the trust, and that, in consideration of their cash contribution to the trust, Aldrich and Murray would have the exclusive right to pursue, collect and retain all insurance reimbursements available in connection with the resolution of Asbestos Claims by the trust. The committee representing current asbestos claimants (the ACC) is not a party to the agreement in principle. Any settlement and its implementation in a plan of reorganization is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court, and there can be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will approve the agreement on the terms proposed.\nOn September 24, 2021, Aldrich and Murray filed the Plan with the Bankruptcy Court. The Plan is supported by, and reflects the agreement in principle reached with the FCR. In connection with the Plan, Aldrich and Murray filed a motion with the Bankruptcy Court to create a $\n270.0\nmillion trust intended to constitute a \"qualified settlement fund\" within the meaning of the Treasury Regulations under Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code (QSF). The funds held in the QSF would be available to provide funding for the Section 524(g) Trust upon effectiveness of the Plan.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, in connection with the agreement in principle reached by Aldrich and Murray with the FCR and the motion to create a $\n270.0\nmillion QSF, the Company recorded a charge of $\n21.2\nmillion to increase its Funding Agreement liability to $\n270.0\nmillion. The corresponding charge was bifurcated between\nOther income/ (expense), net\nof\n$\n7.2\nmillion relating to Murray and discontinued operations of $\n14.0\nmillion relating to Aldrich.\nOn January 27, 2022, the Bankruptcy Court granted the request to fund the QSF. The QSF is expected to be funded in the first quarter of 2022 shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters an order reflecting such approval and such order becomes final and non-appealable. Therefore, as the Company expects to fund the QSF shortly after the Bankruptcy Court enters the order reflecting its approval, the Company reclassified its $\n270.0\nmillion Funding Agreement liability to\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nat December 31, 2021\n.\nAt this point in the Chapter 11 cases of Aldrich and Murray, it is not possible to predict whether the Bankruptcy Court will approve the terms of the Plan, what the extent of the asbestos liability will be or how long the Chapter 11 cases will last. The Chapter 11 cases remain pending as of February 7, 2022.\nFurthermore, in connection with the 2020 Corporate Restructuring, Aldrich, Murray and their respective subsidiaries entered into several agreements with subsidiaries of the Company to ensure they each have access to services necessary for the effective operation of their respective businesses and access to capital to address any liquidity needs that arise as a result of working capital requirements or timing issues. In addition, the Company regularly transacts business with Aldrich and its wholly-owned subsidiary 200 Park and Murray and its wholly-owned subsidiary ClimateLabs. As of the Petition Date, these entities are considered related parties and post deconsolidation activity between the Company and them are reported as third party transactions and are reflected within the Company's Consolidated Statements of Earnings. Since the Petition Date, there were no material transactions between the Company and these entities.\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company continues to be dedicated to environmental and sustainability programs to minimize the use of natural resources, and reduce the utilization and generation of hazardous materials from our manufacturing processes and to remediate identified environmental concerns. As to the latter, the Company is currently engaged in site investigations and remediation activities to address environmental cleanup from past operations at current and former manufacturing facilities and off-site waste disposal facilities.\nF-49\nIt is the Company's policy to establish environmental reserves for investigation and remediation activities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and a reasonable estimate of the liability can be made. Estimated liabilities are determined based upon existing remediation laws and technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations due to unknown environmental conditions, changes in government laws and regulations, and changes in cleanup technologies. The environmental reserves are updated on a routine basis as remediation efforts progress and new information becomes available.\nThe Company is sometimes a party to environmental lawsuits and claims and has received notices of potential violations of environmental laws and regulations from the Environmental Protection Agency and similar state and international authorities. It has also been identified as a potentially responsible party (PRP) for cleanup costs associated with off-site waste disposal at federal Superfund and state remediation sites. In most instances at multi-party sites, the Company's share of the liability is not material.\nIn estimating its liability at multi-party sites, the Company has assumed it will not bear the entire cost of remediation of any site to the exclusion of other PRPs who may be jointly and severally liable. The ability of other PRPs to participate has been taken into account, based on the Company's understanding of the parties’ financial condition and probable contributions on a per site basis.\nReserves for environmental matters are classified as\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nor\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nbased on their expected term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company has recorded reserves for environmental matters of $\n39.6\nmillion and $\n39.9\nmillion, respectively. Of these amounts, $\n36.3\nmillion and $\n37.5\nmillion, respectively, relate to investigation and remediation of properties and multi-waste disposal sites related to businesses formerly owned by the Company.\nWarranty Liability\nStandard product warranty accruals are recorded at the time of sale and are estimated based upon product warranty terms and historical experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liabilities and will make adjustments as necessary based on known or anticipated warranty claims, or as new information becomes available.\nThe changes in the standard product warranty liability for the year ended December 31, were as follows:\nStandard product warranty liabilities are classified as\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\n, or\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nbased on their expected term. The Company's total current standard product warranty reserve at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $\n106.6\nmillion and $\n127.7\nmillion, respectively.\nWarranty Deferred Revenue\nThe Company's extended warranty liability represents the deferred revenue associated with its extended warranty contracts and is amortized into\nNet revenues\non a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, unless another method is more representative of the costs incurred. The Company assesses the adequacy of its liability by evaluating the expected costs under its existing contracts to ensure these expected costs do not exceed the extended warranty liability.\nThe changes in the extended warranty liability for the year ended December 31, were as follows:\nThe extended warranty liability is classified as\nAccrued expenses and other current liabilities\nor\nOther noncurrent liabilities\nbased on the timing of when the deferred revenue is expected to be amortized into\nNet revenues\n. The Company's total current\nF-50\nextended warranty liability at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $\n115.4\nmillion and $\n108.6\nmillion, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company incurred costs of $\n58.5\nmillion, $\n61.0\nmillion and $\n62.8\nmillion, respectively, related to extended warranties.\nF-51"
