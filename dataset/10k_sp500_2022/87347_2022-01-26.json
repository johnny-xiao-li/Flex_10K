    "text": "All references in this report to “Registrant,” “Company,” “Schlumberger,” “we” or “our” are to Schlumberger Limited (Schlumberger N.V.) and its consolidated subsidiaries.\nSchlumberger is a technology company that partners with customers to access energy by providing leading digital solutions and deploying innovative technologies to enable performance and sustainability for the global energy industry.  Schlumberger collaborates to create technology that unlocks access to energy for the benefit of all.\nSchlumberger is organized under four Divisions operating in five distinct Basins that are aligned with critical hubs of activity.   These Divisions combine and integrate Schlumberger’s technologies, enhancing our ability to support the emerging long-term growth opportunities in each of these market segments.\nThe four Divisions are:\nDigital & Integration\n– Combines Schlumberger’s digital workflow solutions and seismic data interpretation and management businesses with its integrated offering of Asset Performance Solutions (“APS”).  Through digital solutions and technologies, supported by the future of software, digital, infrastructure, connected assets, and data, this Division enhances efficiency to improve asset and enterprise-wide performance for customers.  APS helps develop or redevelop fields while increasing production, improving cash flow, and extending recovery for customers by providing fit-for-purpose solutions.\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nAPS creates alignment between Schlumberger and the asset holder and/or the operator utilizing a commercial model whereby Schlumberger receives remuneration in line with the value it creates.  These projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customer assets under long-term agreements.  Schlumberger invests its services and products into the field development activities and operations and is compensated on a fee-per-barrel basis or based on cash flow generated.  This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based on incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.  As of December 31, 2021, Schlumberger’s APS portfolio primarily consisted of three field production projects in Ecuador and one in Canada.\nReservoir Performance\n– Consists of reservoir-centric technologies and services that are critical to optimizing reservoir productivity and performance. Reservoir Performance develops and deploys innovative technologies and services to evaluate, intervene, and stimulate reservoirs that help customers understand subsurface assets and maximize their value.\n3\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nOn December 31, 2020, Schlumberger contributed its onshore hydraulic fracturing business in the United States and Canada (“OneStim\n®\n”), including its pressure pumping, pumpdown perforating, and Permian frac sand businesses, to Liberty Oilfield Services Inc. (“Liberty”), in exchange for a 37% equity interest in Liberty.  OneStim’s historical results were reported as part of the Reservoir Performance Division through the closing of the transaction.  As of December 31, 2021, Schlumberger had a 31% equity interest in Liberty.\nWell Construction\n– Combines the full portfolio of products and services to optimize well placement and performance, maximize drilling efficiency, and improve wellbore assurance.  Well Construction provides operators and drilling rig manufacturers with services and products related to designing and constructing a well.\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\nProduction Systems\n– Develops technologies and provides expertise that enhance production and recovery from subsurface reservoirs to the surface, into pipelines, and to refineries.  Production Systems provides a comprehensive portfolio of equipment and services including subsurface production systems, subsea and surface equipment and services, and midstream production systems.\nThe primary offerings comprising this Division are:\n4\nSupporting the Divisions is a global network of research and engineering centers.  Through these centers Schlumberger advances its technology programs to safely and sustainably enhance industry efficiency, lower finding and producing costs, improve productivity, maximize reserve recovery and increase asset value.\nThe Divisions are deployed around a geographical structure within five Basins:  Americas Land, Offshore Atlantic, Middle East & North Africa, Asia, and Russia & Central Asia.  The Basins are configured around common regional characteristics to deploy fit-for-purpose technologies, operating models and skills and are focused on agility, responsiveness and competitiveness.  The Basins are comprised of GeoUnits, which can be a single country or made up of several countries.  With a strong focus on the customers, Basins identify opportunities for local growth.\nCorporate Strategy\nSchlumberger’s strategy is designed to adapt the Company to an evolving industry landscape shaped by emerging drivers, including capital discipline, regionalization of supply and demand, an efficiency imperative, and resilience—defined by sustainability and lower carbon footprint.  This strategy is designed to magnify Schlumberger’s ability to improve customer performance, which is the differentiating factor that will help our industry meet higher stakeholder expectations.\nOil and gas will remain critical to economic activity and prosperity.  According to the most recent International Energy Agency Sustainable Development Scenario, oil and gas are expected to represent approximately 45% of the global energy mix through 2040.  Schlumberger’s role is twofold: to enable customers to produce these resources efficiently, cost effectively and with the lowest carbon footprint and to support the world’s transition to a more diversified energy mix.\nSchlumberger’s strategy is structured around three major themes, all of which are focused on customer performance: (i) strengthen the core; (ii) go-to-market; and (iii) horizons of growth.\nStrengthen the Core\nThe core of Schlumberger is how we work with customers and execute our business.  The elements in this theme—which include customer collaboration, the integrity and efficiency of our operations, and capital stewardship—are enabled by our people and technology.\nAs a service company, Schlumberger has always worked closely with customers.  We are exploring new ways to collaborate and help them overcome their challenges and improve performance.\nOperations integrity and efficiency—core to Schlumberger’s culture—are enhanced by the digitization of our operations.  Just as Schlumberger is delivering digital solutions to our customers, we are advancing them in our own operations to capture value from our equipment and services businesses by integrating them into our digital structure.\nCapital stewardship is a crucial factor for our industry.  Schlumberger has implemented a capital allocation framework that governs all investments, whether related to capital expenditures, mergers and acquisitions, or research and engineering.  The underlying principle behind this framework is that investment opportunities are prioritized based on returns and cash flow.  Our focus on capital stewardship also includes evolving certain businesses into innovative, less capital-intensive commercial models.\nGo-to-Market\nIndustry markets have evolved into multiple, diverse regional markets that are increasingly competing with each other to meet global, regional, and domestic oil and gas demand.  Each of these regions has a set of resource plays—or basins—with localized economics and operational drivers.  As a result, the industry is witnessing a decoupling of the activity characteristics of each major region, resulting in a unique set of dynamics for each oil and gas basin across the world.  This presents Schlumberger with opportunities that can be optimally addressed with a basin-specific approach.\n5\nA key differentiator for Schlumberger is its “fit-for-basin” approach and ability.  Fit-for-basin describes the mindset Schlumberger has adopted toward technology development, in-country value, and market access. Schlumberger is developing and deploying basin-specific technology that helps its customers overcome the challenges of their respective regions.  At the same time, in-country value enables regional efficiency and performance, while creating opportunity and aligning with the strategic priorities of our clients.\nIn addition, technology access and performance models are highly strategic elements of our go-to-market strategy.  Technology access is fundamentally about making the right decisions with respect to our technology portfolio and how we go to market.  Performance models are focused on commercial and contractual innovations.\nThe elements of our go-to-market strategy enable Schlumberger to develop deeper partnerships with customers, expanding on their needs and challenges from a basin-specific perspective to provide technology and business models tailored to regional or individual customer requirements. These elements allow us to share in the performance improvement we deliver for customers and partners.\nHorizons of Growth\nThe third strategic element positions Schlumberger to increase its share in existing markets and expand into new long-term markets in digital, production and recovery, and energy transition, including Schlumberger New Energy and Transition Technologies.\nDigital capabilities are crucial to long-term performance and resilience.  Through its industry-leading digital platform, Schlumberger will enable digital transformation at scale, unlocking significant value, and leading innovation across the digital domain in the industry.\nSchlumberger seeks to define the future of digital technology in the energy industry and has designed and built a secure and flexible digital industry platform centered around differentiated digital technologies.  Enabled by key partnerships with companies such as Google, IBM, Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, AVEVA and NOV, Schlumberger provides an open digital platform that takes advantage of on-demand, high-performance computing and makes digital capabilities such as embedded artificial intelligence or machine learning readily accessible to customers.\nThe application of digital technology across the entire E&P value chain—from subsurface to drilling to production—has the potential to deliver a step-change in operational workflows that will significantly elevate our customers’ performance sustainably. Digital technology can move technical workflows from the desktop to the cloud, creating data structures that enable artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide insights at scale across our customers’ operations.\nProduction and recovery is about positioning Schlumberger to take advantage of two key trends shaping the market.  The first trend relates to accelerating gas discovery, development and production, as Schlumberger expects to see significant growth in gas demand over the next two decades as the world seeks to decarbonize its energy mix.  The second trend relates to operators’ increased focus on improving recovery from their existing wells, fields and infrastructure—ultimately achieving the most capital efficient production.  As a result and based on our deep domain knowledge from the subsurface to midstream production facilities, we are positioning our technology portfolio to participate and lead in these growing markets.\nFinally, Schlumberger recognizes that its future will expand beyond oil and gas with energy transition, and the Company is positioning itself for long-term growth opportunities.  In this regard, in 2020 the Company created Schlumberger New Energy to develop businesses in low-carbon or carbon-neutral energy technologies, and in 2021 it announced its commitment to reach net-zero emissions by 2050 and launched its Transition Technologies portfolio to reduce emissions from oil and gas operations.\nSchlumberger New Energy is using partnership models and Schlumberger’s experience in technology industrialization to expand into energy verticals beyond oil and gas.  Schlumberger’s approach is to apply its domain expertise in areas adjacent to its existing activities where it can use its global footprint and execution platform to deliver at scale.\nThe Schlumberger New Energy portfolio consists of ventures in the domains of hydrogen, lithium, energy storage, carbon capture and sequestration (“CCS”), geothermal power and geoenergy for heating and cooling buildings.   While many of these investments are in new energy emerging sectors, Schlumberger New Energy has leveraged Schlumberger’s extensive experience in both the CCS and geothermal sectors.  For more than two decades, Schlumberger has participated in CCS projects providing consulting, technology services and project management.  In geothermal, Schlumberger provides the full spectrum of geothermal resource development services through GeothermEx, a consulting and services company we acquired in 2010.  Schlumberger New Energy has extended Schlumberger’s geothermal reach by exploring opportunities in the development of geothermal power projects.\n6\nSchlumberger New Energy activities\ncurrently\ninclude the following ventures and strategic partnerships:\nIn June 2021, Schlumberger announced its commitment to achieve net-zero greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions by 2050.  Guided by climate science and GHG Protocol, Schlumberger spent 18 months conducting extensive analysis and working with experts to produce its decarbonization plan, which is aligned with the Paris Agreement ambition of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.  Schlumberger was the first energy services company to set a net-zero target inclusive of all three emission scopes. By setting targets with respect to the Company’s total 2019 baseline GHG footprint of approximately 54 million metric tons of CO\n2\nequivalent (which consisted of 52 million metric tons of Scope 3 emissions and two million metric tons of Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions), and not just its Scope 1 and 2 footprint, Schlumberger’s comprehensive emissions reduction roadmap addresses the entire oil and gas value chain.\nSchlumberger’s 2050 net zero target is supported by the following interim milestones, using 2019 as the baseline year:\nThere are three key components to Schlumberger achieving its net-zero target: reducing operational emissions, reducing customer emissions that occur while using Schlumberger technology, and taking carbon-negative actions of sufficient scale to offset any residual operational and technology emissions that the Company may have in 2050.\nSchlumberger’s Scope 1 and 2 emissions primarily come from its fuel use and electricity consumption, whereas its Scope 3 emissions are indirect, such as customer emissions related to the use of Schlumberger technology and operational emissions related to purchased goods and services. In 2021, Schlumberger launched its Transition Technologies portfolio.  This portfolio is focused on addressing fugitive emissions, flaring reduction, electrification, well construction emissions, and full field development solutions.  Comprised of proprietary technologies and solutions, the Transition Technologies portfolio will help reduce direct and indirect emissions along with other environmental attributes, while simultaneously driving efficiency, reliability and performance for our customers.\n7\nHuman Capital\nAt December 31, 2021, Schlumberger’s workforce consisted of approximately 92,000 people representing more than 160 nationalities.\nSchlumberger believes that the diversity of its workforce is one of its greatest strengths and its ambition is to maintain a workforce nationality mix that is aligned to its geographical revenue mix.\nSchlumberger recognizes that its ability to attract, develop, motivate and retain a highly competent and diverse workforce has been key to its success for many decades.  As a global company focused on creating and optimizing value for its customers, Schlumberger believes it is critical for its people to communicate with customers in their native languages and to share the values of the people in the countries where it works.  Furthermore, Schlumberger’s diverse workforce positions the Company to effectively deliver services and products that meet the unique expectations and requirements of, its stakeholders, including customers, suppliers and shareholders.  Schlumberger’s long-standing commitment to national and cultural diversity fosters a culture that is global in outlook, yet local in practice, which permeates every layer of the Company.\nIn addition to national and cultural diversity, gender balance is another important pillar of our diversity and inclusion strategy.  Schlumberger is committed to lead our industry in gender diversity.    Schlumberger has made significant progress towards achieving its gender balance goal of having women comprise 25% of the Company’s salaried workforce by 2025.  In this regard, in 2021, Schlumberger set its next goal which is for women to comprise 30% of the Company’s salaried workforce by 2030.  As of December 31, 2021, women made up approximately 23% of the Company’s salaried workforce.  Additionally, approximately 22% of management roles were held by women in 2021 and women represented approximately 48% of our 2021 new hires of salaried employees with science, technology, engineering and mathematics backgrounds.\nSchlumberger is proud to provide a career platform that enables a culture of lifelong learning for all employees. Schlumberger is committed to offering borderless careers and making career decisions based on merit.  Schlumberger’s borderless careers philosophy is powered by its internal mobility practices, which offer employees multiple, flexible, career paths to help them acquire the required skills to reach their ambition. We seek to provide continuous growth opportunities through a combination of training and experience. Schlumberger strives to identify talent early and to provide opportunities for those employees who demonstrate exceptional performance and potential to progress to higher levels within the organization. These opportunities accelerate career development while fostering an agile workforce and the next generation of business leaders.\n8\nCompetition\nThe principal methods of competition within the energy services industry are technological innovation, quality of service and price differentiation.  These factors vary geographically and are dependent upon the different services and products that Schlumberger offers.  Schlumberger has numerous competitors, both large and small.\nIntellectual Property\nSchlumberger owns and controls a variety of intellectual property, including but not limited to patents, proprietary information, trade secrets and software tools and applications that, in the aggregate, are material to Schlumberger’s business.  While Schlumberger seeks and holds numerous patents covering various products and processes, no particular patent or group of patents is material to Schlumberger’s business.\nSeasonality\nSeasonal changes in weather and significant weather events can temporarily affect the delivery of Schlumberger’s products and services.  For example, the spring thaw in Canada and consequent road restrictions can affect activity levels, while the winter months in the North Sea, Russia and China can produce severe weather conditions that can temporarily reduce levels of activity.  In addition, hurricanes and typhoons can disrupt coastal and offshore operations.  Furthermore, customer spending patterns for multiclient data, software and other products may result in higher activity in the fourth quarter of the year as clients seek to fully utilize their annual budgets.  Conversely, customer budget constraints in North America may lead to lower demand for our services and products in the fourth quarter of the year.\nCustomers\nSchlumberger’s primary customers are national oil companies, large integrated oil companies and independent operators. No single customer exceeded 10% of Schlumberger’s consolidated revenue during each of 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nGovernmental Regulations\nSchlumberger is subject to numerous environmental and other governmental and regulatory requirements related to its operations worldwide.

    "text": "The following discussion of risk factors known to us contains important information for the understanding of our “forward-looking statements,” which are discussed immediately following Item 7A. of this Form 10-K and elsewhere.  These risk factors should also be read in conjunction with Item 7.  Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nand related notes included in this Form 10-K.\nWe urge you to consider carefully the risks described below, which discuss the material factors that make an investment in our securities speculative or risky, as well as in other reports and materials that we file with the SEC and the other information included or incorporated by reference in this Form 10-K.  Additional risks and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also materially adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nDemand for our products and services is substantially dependent on the levels of expenditures by our customers.  Recent oil and gas industry downturns have resulted in reduced demand for oilfield products and services and lower expenditures by our customers, which has in the past had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nDemand for our products and services depends substantially on expenditures by our customers for the exploration, development and production of oil and gas reserves.  These expenditures are generally dependent on our customers’ views of future demand for oil and gas and future oil and gas prices, as well as our customers’ ability to access capital.  In addition, the transition of the global energy sector from primarily a fossil fuel-based system to renewable energy sources could affect our customers’ levels of expenditures.\nActual and anticipated declines in oil and gas prices have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, lower capital expenditures, project modifications, delays or cancellations, general business disruptions, and delays in payment of, or nonpayment of, amounts that are owed to us.  These effects have had, and may in the future have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nHistorically, oil and gas prices have experienced significant volatility and can be affected by a variety of factors, including:\nThe oil and gas industry has historically experienced periodic downturns, which have been characterized by diminished demand for our products and services and downward pressure on the prices that we are able to charge.  Sustained market uncertainty can also result in lower demand and pricing for our products and services.  A significant industry downturn, sustained market uncertainty, or increased\navailability of economical alternative energy sources\ncould result in a reduction in demand for our products and services, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and prospects.\nDisruptions in the political, regulatory, economic, and social environments of the countries in which we operate could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe generate revenue in more than 120 countries across the world.  Our non-US operations accounted for approximately 85% of our consolidated revenue in 2021, 81% in 2020 and 72% in 2019.  Instability and unforeseen changes in any of the markets in which we operate could result in business disruptions that may have an adverse effect on the demand for our products and services or our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. These factors include, but are not limited to, the following:\n11\nFailure to effectively and timely address the energy transition could adversely affect our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur long-term success depends on our ability to effectively address the energy transition, which will require adapting our technology portfolio to potentially changing government requirements and customer preferences, as well as engaging with our customers to develop solutions to decarbonize oil and gas operations. If the energy transition landscape changes faster than anticipated or in a manner that we do not anticipate, demand for our products and services could be adversely affected. Furthermore, if we fail or are perceived to not effectively implement an energy transition strategy, or if investors or financial institutions shift funding away from companies in fossil fuel-related industries, our access to capital or the market for our securities could be negatively impacted.\nWe operate in a highly competitive environment.  If we are unable to maintain technology leadership, this could adversely affect any competitive advantage we hold.\nThe energy industry is highly competitive.  Our business may be adversely affected if we fail to continue developing and producing innovative technologies in response to changes in the market, including customer and government requirements, or if we fail to deliver such technologies to our customers in a timely and cost-competitive manner.  If we are unable to maintain technology leadership in our industry, our ability to maintain market share, defend, maintain or increase prices for our products and services, and negotiate acceptable contract terms with our customers could be adversely affected.  Furthermore, if competing technology accelerates the obsolescence of any of our products or services, the value of our intellectual property may be reduced, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nLimitations on our ability to obtain, maintain, protect or enforce our intellectual property rights, including our trade secrets, could cause a loss in revenue and any competitive advantage we hold.\nThere can be no assurance that the steps we take to obtain, maintain, protect and enforce our intellectual property rights will be adequate.  Some of our products or services, and the processes we use to produce or provide them, have been granted patent protection, have patent applications pending, or are trade secrets.  Our business may be adversely affected when our patents are unenforceable, the claims allowed under our patents are not sufficient to protect our technology, our patent applications are denied, or our trade secrets are not adequately protected.  Patent protection on some types of technology, such as software or machine learning processes, may not be available in certain countries in which we operate.  Our competitors may also be able to develop technology independently that is similar to ours without infringing on our patents or gaining access to our trade secrets, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThird parties may claim that we have infringed upon or otherwise violated their intellectual property rights.\nThe tools, techniques, methodologies, programs and components we use to provide our services and products may infringe upon or otherwise violate the intellectual property rights of others or be challenged on that basis.  Regardless of the merits, any such claims generally result in significant legal and other costs, including reputational harm, and may distract management from running our business.  Resolving such claims could increase our costs, including through royalty payments to acquire licenses, if available, from third parties and through the development of replacement technologies.  If a license to resolve a claim were not available, we might not be able to continue providing a particular service or product, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n12\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nOur operations require us to comply with numerous laws and regulations, violations of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to international, regional, national, and local laws and regulations in every place where we operate, relating to matters such as environmental protection, health and safety, labor and employment, import/export controls, currency exchange, bribery and corruption, data privacy and cybersecurity, intellectual property, immigration, and taxation.  These laws and regulations are complex, frequently change, and have tended to become more stringent over time.  In the event the scope of these laws and regulations expands in the future, the incremental cost of compliance could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations, or cash flows.\nOur operations are subject to anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the U.K. Bribery Act and other similar laws.  We are also subject to trade control regulations and trade sanctions laws that restrict the movement of certain goods to, and certain operations in, various countries or with certain persons.  Our ability to transfer people, products and data among certain countries is subject to maintaining required licenses and complying with these laws and regulations.\nThe internal controls, policies and procedures, and employee training and compliance programs we have implemented to deter prohibited practices may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies or from material violations of applicable laws and regulations.  Any determination that we have violated or are responsible for violations of anti-bribery, trade control, trade sanctions or anti-corruption laws could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.  Violations of international and US laws and regulations or the loss of any required licenses may result in fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.  In addition, any major violations could have a significant effect on our reputation and consequently on our ability to win future business and maintain existing customer and supplier relationships.\nExisting or future laws, regulations, court orders or other initiatives to limit greenhouse gas emissions or relating to climate change may reduce demand for our products and services.\nContinuing political and social attention to the issue of climate change has resulted in both existing and proposed international agreements and national, regional and local legislation and regulatory measures to limit GHG emissions. The implementation of these agreements, including the Paris Agreement, the Europe Climate Law, and other existing or future regulatory mandates, may adversely affect the demand for our products and services, impose taxes on us or our customers, require us or our customers to reduce GHG emissions from our technologies or operations, or accelerate the obsolescence of our products or services.\nIn addition, increasing attention to the risks of climate change has resulted in an increased possibility of litigation or investigations brought by public and private entities against oil and gas companies in connection with their GHG emissions.  As a result, we or our customers may become subject to court orders compelling a reduction of GHG emissions or requiring mitigation of the effects of climate change.\nThere is also increased focus by governments and our customers, investors and other stakeholders on climate change, sustainability and energy transition matters. Negative attitudes toward or perceptions of our industry or fossil fuel products and their relationship to the environment have led governments, non-governmental organizations, and companies to implement initiatives to conserve energy and promote the use of alternative energy sources, which may reduce the demand for and production of oil and gas in areas of the world where our customers operate, and thus reduce future demand for our products and services.  In addition, initiatives by investors and financial institutions to limit funding to companies in fossil fuel-related industries may adversely affect our liquidity or access to capital. Any of these initiatives may, in turn, adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nEnvironmental compliance costs and liabilities arising as a result of environmental laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including those governing air and GHG emissions, water discharges and waste management, as well as the importation and use of hazardous materials, radioactive materials, chemicals and explosives.  The technical requirements of these laws and regulations are becoming increasingly complex, stringent and expensive to implement.  These laws sometimes provide for “strict liability” for remediation costs, damages to natural resources or threats to public health and safety.  Strict liability can render us liable for damages without regard to our degree of care or fault.  Some environmental laws provide for joint and several strict liability for remediation of spills and releases of hazardous substances, and, as a result, we could be liable for the actions of others.\nWe use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our operations.  In addition, many of our current and former properties are, or have been, used for industrial purposes.  Accordingly, we could become subject to material liabilities relating to the investigation\n13\nand cleanup of potentially contaminated properties, and to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of exposures to, or releases of, hazardous substances.  In addition, stricter enforcement or changing interpretations of existing laws and regulations, the enactment of new laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new or increased requirements could require us to incur costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could have a material adverse effect on our business, operations and financial condition.\nWe could be subject to substantial liability claims, including as a result of well incidents, which could adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe technical complexities of our operations expose us to a wide range of significant health, safety and environmental risks.  Our operations involve production-related activities, radioactive materials, chemicals, explosives and other equipment and services that are deployed in challenging exploration, development and production environments.  Accidents or acts of malfeasance involving these services or equipment, or a failure of a product (including as a result of a cyberattack), could cause personal injury, loss of life, damage to or destruction of property, equipment or the environment, or suspension of operations, which could materially adversely affect us.  Any well incidents, including blowouts at a well site or any loss of containment or well control, may expose us to additional liabilities, which could be material.  Generally, we rely on contractual indemnities, releases, and limitations on liability with our customers and insurance to protect us from potential liability related to such events.  However, our insurance may not protect us against liability for certain kinds of events, including events involving pollution, or against losses resulting from business interruption.  Moreover, we may not be able to maintain insurance at levels of risk coverage or policy limits that we deem adequate.  Any damages caused by our services or products that are not covered by insurance or are in excess of policy limits or subject to substantial deductibles, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe COVID-19 pandemic and resulting adverse economic conditions have had, and may to continue to have, a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic caused\na significant and swift reduction in\nglobal economic activity during 2020, which significantly weakened demand for oil and gas, and in turn, for our products and services.  Other effects of the pandemic included, and may continue to include, significant volatility and disruption of the global financial markets; adverse revenue and net income effects; disruptions to our operations, including suspension or deferral of\ndrilling activities\n; customer shutdowns of oil and gas exploration and production; downward revisions to customer budgets; limitations on access to sources of liquidity; supply chain disruptions; limitations on access to raw materials; employee impacts from illness, school closures and other community response measures; and temporary closures of our facilities or the facilities of our customers and suppliers.  The pandemic is continuously evolving, and the extent to which our operating and financial results will continue to be affected will depend on various factors beyond our control, such as the ultimate duration, severity and sustained geographic resurgence of the virus; the emergence of new variants and strains of the virus; and the success of actions to contain the virus and its variants, or treat its impact, such as the availability and acceptance of vaccines.  COVID-19, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, could also aggravate our other risk factors described in this Form 10-K.\nOur operations are subject to cyber incidents that could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are highly dependent on digital technologies and services to conduct our business.  We use these technologies for internal purposes, including data storage, processing and transmission, as well as in our interactions with our business associates, such as customers and suppliers.  In addition, we develop software and other digital products and services that store, retrieve, manipulate and manage our customers’ information and data, external data, personal data, and our own data.  Our digital technologies and services, and those of our business associates, are subject to the risk of cyberattacks and, given the nature of such attacks, some incidents can remain undetected for a period of time despite efforts to detect and respond to them in a timely manner.  There can be no assurance that the systems we have designed to prevent or limit the effects of cyber incidents or attacks will be sufficient to prevent or detect material consequences arising from such incidents or attacks, or to avoid a material adverse impact on our systems after such incidents or attacks do occur.  We have experienced and will continue to experience varying degrees of cyber incidents in the normal conduct of our business, including attacks resulting from phishing emails and ransomware infections.  Even if we successfully defend our own digital technologies and services, we also rely on third-party business associates, with whom we may share data and services, to defend their digital technologies and services against attack.\nWe could suffer significant damage to our reputation if a cyber incident or attack were to allow unauthorized access to or modification of our customers’ data, other external data, personal data, or our own data, or if the services we provide to our customers were disrupted, or if our digital products or services were reported to have or were perceived as having security vulnerabilities.  This could lead to fewer customers using our digital products and services, which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations.  In addition, if our systems, or our third-party business associates’ systems, for protecting against cybersecurity risks prove to be insufficient, we could be adversely affected by, among other things, loss of or damage to intellectual property, proprietary or confidential information, or customer, supplier, or employee data; breach of personal data; interruption of our business operations; increased legal and regulatory exposure, including fines and remediation costs; and increased costs required to\n14\nprevent, respond to, or mitigate cybersecurity attacks.  These risks could harm our reputation and our relationships with our employees, business associates and other third parties, and may result in claims against us.  The occurrence of any of these risks could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nOur aspirations, goals, and initiatives related to sustainability and emissions reduction, and our public statements and disclosures regarding them, expose us to numerous risks.\nWe have developed, and will continue to develop and set, goals, targets, and other objectives related to sustainability matters, including our net-zero target and our energy transition strategy.  Statements related to these goals, targets and objectives reflect our current plans and do not constitute a guarantee that they will be achieved.  Our efforts to research, establish, accomplish, and accurately report on these goals, targets, and objectives expose us to numerous operational, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks.  Our ability to achieve any stated goal, target, or objective, including with respect to emissions reduction, is subject to numerous factors and conditions, some of which are outside of our control.\nOur business may face increased scrutiny from investors and other stakeholders related to our sustainability activities, including the goals, targets, and objectives that we announce, and our methodologies and timelines for pursuing them.  If our sustainability practices do not meet investor or other stakeholder expectations and standards, which continue to evolve, our reputation, our ability to attract or retain employees, and our attractiveness as an investment or business partner could be negatively affected.  Similarly, our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill our sustainability-focused goals, targets, and objectives, to comply with ethical, environmental, or other standards, regulations, or expectations, or to satisfy various reporting standards with respect to these matters, within the timelines we announce, or at all, could adversely affect our business or reputation, as well as expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation.\nFailure to attract and retain qualified personnel could impede our operations.\nOur future success depends on our ability to recruit, train, and retain qualified personnel.  We require highly skilled personnel to operate and provide technical services and support for our business.  Competition for the personnel necessary for our businesses intensifies as activity increases and technology evolves.  In periods of high utilization, it is often more difficult to find and retain qualified individuals.  This could increase our costs or have other material adverse effects on our operations.\nSevere weather, including extreme weather conditions associated with climate change, has in the past and may in the future adversely affect our operations and financial results.\nOur business has been, and in the future will be, affected by severe weather in areas where we operate, which could materially affect our operations and financial results.  Extreme weather conditions such as hurricanes, flooding and landslides have in the past resulted in, and may in the future result in, the evacuation of personnel, stoppage of services and activity disruptions at our facilities, in our supply chain, or at well-sites, or result in disruptions of our customers’ operations.  Particularly severe weather events affecting platforms or structures may result in a suspension of activities.  In addition, acute or chronic physical impacts of climate change, such as sea level rise, coastal storm surge, inland flooding from intense rainfall and hurricane-strength winds may damage our facilities.  Any such extreme weather events may result in increased operating costs or decreases in revenue, which could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows."

    "text": "The following discussion and analysis contains forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, statements relating to our plans, strategies, objectives, expectations, intentions and resources.  Such forward-looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under “Item 1A. Risk Factors” of this Form 10-K.\nThis section of the Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 items and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020.   Discussions of 2019 items and year-to-year comparison between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in Part II, Item 7 of Schlumberger’s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020.\n2021 Executive Overview\nContinuing a broad recovery that began in 2020, oil markets were generally positive throughout the year, with Brent oil price starting 2021 at the year’s low of $51 per barrel, reaching a high of $85 in November.  Sentiment in oil markets was largely positive as global demand recovered and supply was managed by a combination of the reassurance of continued intervention from OPEC+, and ongoing capital discipline by publicly traded operators in North America.\nWithin the context of strengthening fundamentals across the year, there were several instances where the potential impact of COVID-19 variants raised concerns regarding demand growth. However, these periods were shorter lived than the prolonged decline in 2020, which was characterized by economic lockdowns, and oil prices soon rebounded. Pricing was initially supported by OPEC+ production agreements that had come into effect in 2020 and remained resilient as those production targets were gradually increased in the second half of 2021, as crude and product stocks continued a multiyear downward trend.\nInternational activity grew broadly across geographies in the second half of the year, including offshore and deepwater, with operators investing in projects to meet long-term objectives and regional demand growth.\nActivity in North America land also rebounded, albeit from a very low base in 2020, but did not return to prepandemic levels, as investment and production were subdued as a result of continued capital discipline on the part of larger producers.\nInternational natural gas pricing, while following the traditional seasonal pattern, was volatile, swinging from pandemic-driven lows in 2020 to record highs around the world. Domestically, US Henry Hub natural gas prices rose dramatically, averaging $3.91 per million British thermal units on a monthly basis—as compared to $2.04 in 2020—and reaching a peak of $5.87 in October before ending the year at $3.73.\nAgainst this backdrop, Schlumberger’s full-year 2021 revenue of $22.9 billion decreased 3% year-on-year as a result of the divestitures of the OneStim pressure pumping business and the North America low-flow artificial lift business during the fourth quarter of 2020.  These divestitures were consistent with Schlumberger’s strategy to focus on expanding margins, minimizing earnings volatility and focusing on less capital-intensive businesses by high-grading and rationalizing its business portfolio.  The divested businesses accounted for approximately 25% of Schlumberger’s North America revenue in 2020. Excluding the impact of these divestitures, which generated $1.3 billion of revenue during 2020 (all of which was in North America), full-year 2021 global revenue grew 3% year-on-year, driven by an 8% increase in North America and a 2% increase in international revenue.\nFinancial performance in 2021 was driven by global oil and gas activity growth in the second half of the year as investment spending experienced double-digit growth year-on-year. Consequently, Schlumberger’s revenue in the second half of 2021 grew 12% compared to the same period of 2020, and increased 18% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures.  International revenue increased 12% year-on-year during the second half of 2021, and North America revenue increased 10%, or 44% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures (which generated $0.5 billion of revenue during the second half of 2020).\nLooking ahead into 2022, we believe the industry macro fundamentals are very favorable, due to the combination of projected steady demand recovery, an increasingly tight supply market, and supportive oil prices. Schlumberger expects this to result in a material step up in industry capital spending with double-digit growth in\nboth the\ninternational and North American markets.  Absent any further significant COVID-related disruption, oil demand is expected to exceed prepandemic levels before the end of the year and further strengthen in 2023. We believe these favorable market conditions are similar to those experienced during the last industry supercycle, suggesting that resurgent global demand-led capital spending will result in an exceptional multiyear growth cycle.\nThroughout 2021,\nSchlumberger\ncontinued to strengthen\nits\ncore portfolio, enhanced\nits\nsustainability leadership, successfully advanced its digital journey, and expanded\nits\nnew energy portfolio.  Schlumberger is well prepared to fully seize this growth ahead.\nSchlumberger is entering\nthis cycle in a position of strength, having reset\nits\noperating leverage, expanded peer-leading margins across multiple quarters, and aligned\nits\ntechnology and business portfolio with the new industry imperatives.\n17\nFourth Quarter 20\n2\n1\nResults\nFourth-quarter revenue of $6.22 billion increased 6% sequentially as a result of broad-based growth across all geographies and Divisions.\nInternational revenue of $4.90 billion grew 5% sequentially, driven primarily by strengthening activity, increased digital sales, and early benefits of pricing improvements. The sequential revenue increase was led by growth in Europe/CIS/Africa largely due to strong offshore activity in Africa. This growth was complemented by project startups and activity gains in the Middle East & Asia and sustained activity growth in Latin America.\nIn North America, revenue of $1.28 billion grew 13% sequentially, outperforming the rig count growth. The sequential growth was driven by strong offshore and land drilling activity and increased exploration data licensing.\nFourth-quarter pretax segment operating margin of 16% increased 31 basis points (bps) sequentially, reaching its highest quarterly level since 2015, largely as a result of the accretive effect of accelerating digital sales.\nDigital & Integration\nFourth-quarter revenue of $889 million increased 10% sequentially,\npropelled by accelerated digital sales internationally, particularly in Europe/CIS/Africa and Middle East & Asia, and increased exploration data licensing sales in North America offshore and the Permian. These increases, however, were partially offset by the effects of a temporary production interruption in the APS projects in Ecuador due to pipeline disruption.\nDigital & Integration pretax operating margin of 38% expanded 268 bps sequentially, primarily due to higher digital and exploration data licensing sales.\nReservoir Performance\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.3 billion increased 8% sequentially, primarily due to higher intervention activity across the international offshore markets and activity gains in the Middle East & Asia.\nReservoir Performance pretax operating margin of 16% was essentially flat sequentially.\n18\nWell Construction\nFourth-quarter revenue of $2.4 billion increased 5% sequentially, driven by higher measurements and drilling fluids activity and increased drilling equipment sales. North America revenue increased 15% due to higher rig count on land and increased well construction activity in the US Gulf of Mexico. International revenue growth of 3% was driven by growth in Latin America.\nWell Construction pretax operating margin of 15% was essentially flat sequentially.\nProduction Systems\nFourth-quarter revenue of $1.8 billion increased 5% sequentially driven by a 6% increase in international revenue.  This growth was mainly in Europe/CIS/Africa as a result of strong project progress.\nProduction Systems pretax operating margin of 9% declined 85 bps sequentially due to an unfavorable mix and the impact of delayed deliveries due to global supply and logistics constraints.\nFull-Year 2021 Results\nFull-year 2021 revenue of $22.9 billion decreased 3% year-on-year primarily as a result of the divestitures of the\nOneStim pressure pumping business and the low-flow artificial lift business during the fourth quarter of 2020. Excluding the impact of these divestitures, which\ngenerated $1.3 billion of revenue (all of which was in North America) during 2020, global revenue increased 3% year-on-year.\nIn North America revenue declined 18% year-on-year; however, excluding the impact of the previously described divestitures, full-year revenue increased 8%.  International revenue also increased 2%.\nThe growth in 2021 was driven by strong global oil and gas activity in the second half of the year.  Schlumberger’s revenue in the second half of 2021 grew 12% compared to the same period of 2020 and increased 18% when adjusted for the effects of the divestitures.  This growth was pervasive across all geographies and Divisions.\nFull-year 2021 pretax operating margin of 15% was 450 bps higher compared to 2020, primarily due to the divestiture of certain businesses in North America, which were previously dilutive to margins, combined with reduced depreciation and amortization expense following the asset impairment charges recorded during 2020 and the effects of cost reduction measures.\n19\nDigital & Integration\nFull-year 2021 revenue of $3.3 billion increased 7% year-on-year, primarily driven by robust APS project revenue from higher production and improved oil prices\n.\nYear-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 11 percentage points to 35%.  Operating margin increased due to improved profitability from APS projects as a result of higher oil prices and reduced amortization expense following the asset impairment charges that were recorded during 2020 relating to certain APS investments.\nReservoir Performance\nFull-year 2021 revenue of $4.6 billion decreased 18% year-on-year, largely reflecting the effects of the OneStim divestiture, which generated $1.2 billion of revenue during 2020.  Excluding the impact of the OneStim divestiture, revenue increased 5%\nyear-on-year primarily driven by strong activity in Latin America.\nYear-on-year, pretax operating margin increased by 779 bps to 14% despite the significant drop in revenue, primarily due to the divestiture of the OneStim business, which was previously dilutive to margins.\nWell Construction\nFull-year 2021 revenue of $8.7 billion increased 1% year-on-year.\nYear-on-year, pretax operating margin increased 363 bps to 14% despite the relatively flat revenue, largely as a result of the implementation of cost control measures.\nProduction Systems\nFull-year 2021 revenue of $6.7 billion increased 1% year-on-year, primarily driven by improved international activity that was largely offset by a decline in completions activity in North America as a result of the pandemic.\nYear-on-year, pretax operating margin was essentially flat at 9%.\nInterest and Other Income\nInterest & other income\nconsisted of the following:\nThe decrease in earnings of equity method investments in 2021 as compared to 2020 is primarily attributable to Schlumberger’s share of net losses associated with Schlumberger’s investment in Liberty.  Schlumberger records its share of Liberty’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021 Schlumberger sold 9.5 million of its shares of Liberty and recognized a gain of $28 million.  See Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nDuring the third quarter of 2021, a start-up company that Schlumberger previously invested in was acquired.  As a result of this transaction, Schlumberger’s ownership interest was converted into shares of a publicly traded company.  Schlumberger recognized an unrealized pretax gain of $47 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its estimated fair value of approximately $55 million.  See Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, a start-up company that Schlumberger previously invested in completed an initial public offering.  As a result, Schlumberger recognized an unrealized gain of $39 million to increase the carrying value of this investment to its fair\n20\nvalue of\n$43 million as of December 31, 2020\n.  See\nNote 3\nto the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nSchlumberger sold this investment during 2021, which did not result in a material gain or loss.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense of $539 million in 2021 decreased $24 million compared to 2020 primarily as a result of the $2.7 billion year-on-year reduction in total debt outstanding.\nOther\nResearch & engineering\nand\nGeneral & administrative\nexpenses, as a percentage of\nRevenue\n, were as follows:\nIncome Taxes\nThe Schlumberger effective tax rate is sensitive to the geographic mix of earnings.  When the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America increases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally decreases.  Conversely, when the percentage of pretax earnings generated outside of North America decreases, the Schlumberger effective tax rate generally increases.\nThe Schlumberger effective tax rate was 19% in 2021 as compared to 7% in 2020.  The increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to the charges and credits described in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.  These charges and credits reduced the effective tax rate in 2020 by 12 percentage points as a significant portion of these charges were not tax-effective.\nCharges and Credits\nSchlumberger recorded charges and credits during 2021 and 2020.  These charges and credits, which are summarized below, are more fully described in Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.\nThe following is a summary of the 2021 charges and credits.\n21\nThe following is a summary of the 2020 charges and credits.\nAs a result of the first quarter 2020 impairment charges, commencing with the second quarter of 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $95 million on a quarterly basis.  Approximately $33 million of this quarterly reduction is reflected in the Digital & Integration Division and $12 million is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division.  The remaining $50 million is reflected in the “Corporate & other” line item.\nAs a result of the second quarter 2020 restructuring and impairment charges, commencing with the third quarter of 2020, depreciation and amortization expense was reduced by approximately $80 million and lease expense was reduced by $25 million on a quarterly basis.  Approximately $51 million of this quarterly reduction is reflected in the Digital & Integration Division and $31 million is reflected in the Reservoir Performance Division, with the remaining $23 million reflected among the Well Construction Division and Production Systems Division.\nAs a result of the third quarter 2020 restructuring charges, commencing with the fourth quarter of 2020, depreciation and lease expense was reduced by $15 million on a quarterly basis.  This quarterly reduction is reflected among all of the Divisions.\n22\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nDetails of the components of liquidity as well as changes in liquidity follow:\n23\nKey liquidity events during 2021 and 2020 included:\nAs of December 31, 2021, Schlumberger had $3.14 billion of cash and short-term investments and committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $6.60 billion, all of which was available and unused.  Schlumberger believes these amounts, along with cash generated by ongoing operations, will be sufficient to meet future business requirements for the next 12 months and beyond.\n24\nThe following table reflects the carrying amounts of Schlumberger’s debt at December 31, 2021 by year of maturity:\nInterest payments on fixed rate debt obligations by year are as follows:\nSee Note 13,\nLeases\nof the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor details regarding Schlumberger’s lease obligations.\nSchlumberger has outstanding letters of credit/guarantees that relate to business performance bonds, custom/excise tax commitments, facility lease/rental obligations, etc.  These were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where Schlumberger operates.\n25\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States requires Schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses.  The following accounting policies involve “critical accounting estimates” because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by Schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain.\nSchlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nAllowance for Doubtful Accounts\nSchlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value.  Judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve.  Allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible, including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices.  Adjustments to the allowance may be required in future periods depending on how such potential issues are resolved, or if the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments.\nAs a large multinational company with a long history of operating in a cyclical industry, Schlumberger has extensive experience in working with its customers during difficult times to manage its accounts receivable.  During weak economic environments or when there is an extended period of weakness in oil and gas prices, Schlumberger typically experiences delays in the payment of its receivables.  However, except for a $469 million accounts receivable write-off during 2017 as a result of the political and economic condition in Venezuela, Schlumberger has not historically had material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable.  Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries.  As of December 31, 2021, five of those countries individually accounted for greater than 5% of Schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance, of which only one (the United States) accounted for greater than 10% of such receivables.\nAt times in recent periods, Schlumberger has experienced delays in payments from its primary customer in Mexico.  Included in\nReceivables, less allowance for doubtful accounts\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nas of December 30, 2021 is approximately $0.5 billion of receivables relating to Mexico at December 31, 2021 ($0.7 billion at December 31, 2020).  Schlumberger’s receivables from its primary customer in Mexico are not in dispute and Schlumberger has not historically had any material write-offs due to uncollectible accounts receivable relating to this customer.\nGoodwill, Intangible Assets and Long-Lived Assets\nSchlumberger records the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed as goodwill.  The goodwill relating to each of Schlumberger’s reporting units is tested for impairment annually as well as when an event, or change in circumstances, indicates an impairment may have occurred.\nUnder generally accepted accounting principles, Schlumberger has the option to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether the existence of events or circumstances leads to a determination that it is more likely than not that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is greater than its carrying amount.  If, after assessing the totality of events or circumstances, Schlumberger determines it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount, there is no need to perform any further testing.  However, if Schlumberger concludes otherwise, then it is required to perform a quantitative impairment test by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit and comparing the fair value with the carrying amount of the reporting unit.  If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded based on that difference.\nSchlumberger has the option to bypass the qualitative assessment for any reporting unit in any period and proceed directly to performing the quantitative goodwill impairment test.\nSchlumberger elected to perform the qualitative assessment described above for purposes of its annual goodwill impairment test in 2021.  Based on this assessment, Schlumberger concluded it was more likely than not that the fair value of each of its reporting units was significantly greater than its carrying amount.  Accordingly, no further testing was required.\nDuring 2020 and 2019, Schlumberger recorded goodwill impairment charges of $3.1 billion and $8.8 billion and intangible asset impairment charges of $3.3 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively.  Refer to Note 3 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\nfor details regarding the facts and circumstances that led to this impairment and how the fair value of each reporting unit was estimated, including the significant assumptions used and other details.\nLong-lived assets, including fixed assets, intangible assets and investments in APS projects, are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.  In reviewing for impairment, the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual\n26\ndisposition.\nIf such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset’s recorded value, an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long-lived asset to its estimated fair value.\nThe determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long-lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management.\nIf there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value, Schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future.\nIncome Taxes\nSchlumberger conducts business in more than 100 tax jurisdictions, a number of which have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving.  Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audits by the tax authorities.  These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the authorities or, potentially, through the courts.  Schlumberger recognizes the impact of a tax position in its financial statements if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit, based on the technical merits of the position.  Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits.  Estimates of these tax liabilities are judgmental and are made based upon prior experience, and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances.  However, due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities that could be materially different from these estimates.  In such an event, Schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs.\nRevenue Recognition for Certain Long-term Construction-type Contracts\nSchlumberger recognizes revenue for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time.  These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications.  Under this method, revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract.  Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs.  Approximately 6% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2021, and 5% in each of 2020 and 2019, respectively, was recognized under this method.\nThe estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project.  Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims.  Profits are recognized based on the estimated project profit multiplied by the percentage complete.  Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs are often required as work progresses.  Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nSchlumberger’s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in Note 16 to the\nConsolidated Financial Statements\n.  The obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates.  These assumptions are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis, or upon the occurrence of significant events.\nThe discount rate that Schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high-quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of payment of the related benefit obligations.  The following summarizes the discount rates utilized by Schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans:\nThe expected rate of return for Schlumberger’s retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation are expected to be paid, with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class.  The average expected rate of return on plan assets for the United States pension plans was 6.60% in both 2021 and 2020.  The weighted average expected rate of return on plan assets for the international pension plans was 6.73% in 2021 and 6.71% in 2020.

    "text": "Schlumberger is subject to market risks primarily associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAs a multinational company, Schlumberger generates revenue in more than 120 countries.  Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  Approximately 70% of Schlumberger’s revenue in 2021 was denominated in US dollars.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase.\nSchlumberger maintains a foreign-currency risk management strategy that uses derivative instruments to manage the impact of changes in foreign exchange rates on its earnings.  Schlumberger enters into foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against currency fluctuations on certain monetary assets and liabilities, and certain expenses denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\nA 10% appreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2021 market rates would increase the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $5 million.  Conversely, a 10% depreciation in the US dollar from the December 31, 2021 market rates would decrease the unrealized value of Schlumberger’s forward contracts by $8 million.  In either scenario, the gain or loss on the forward contract would be offset by the gain or loss on the underlying transaction, and therefore, would have no impact on future earnings.\nAt December 31, 2021, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $7.7 billion in various foreign currencies, of which $6.0 billion related to hedges of debt balances denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\nForward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K, as well as other statements we make, contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the federal securities laws, which include any statements that are not historical facts.\nSuch statements often contain words such as “expect,” “may,” “can,” “believe,” “predict,” “plan,” “potential,” “projected,” “projections,” “forecast,” “estimate,” “intend,” “anticipate,” “ambition,” “goal,” “target,” “think,” “should,” “could,” “would,” “will,” “see,” “likely,” and other similar words. Forward-looking statements address matters that are, to varying degrees, uncertain, such as statements about Schlumberger’s financial and performance targets and other\nforecasts or expectations regarding\n, or dependent on, its\nbusiness outlook; growth for Schlumberger as a whole and for each of its Divisions (and for specified business lines, geographic areas or technologies within each Division); oil and natural gas demand and production growth; oil and natural gas prices;\nforecasts or expectations regarding energy transition and global climate change;\nimprovements in operating procedures and technology; capital expenditures by Schlumberger and the oil and gas industry; the business strategies of Schlumberger, including digital and “fit for basin,” as well as the strategies of Schlumberger’s customers; Schlumberger’s effective tax rate; Schlumberger’s APS projects, joint ventures, and other alliances; Schlumberger’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic and its preparedness for other widespread health emergencies; access to raw materials; future global economic and geopolitical conditions; future liquidity; and future results of operations, such as margin levels.  These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, including, but not limited to, changing global economic conditions; changes in exploration and production spending by Schlumberger’s customers and changes in the level of oil and natural gas exploration and development; the results of operations and financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers and suppliers; Schlumberger’s inability to achieve its financial and performance targets and other forecasts and expectations; Schlumberger’s inability to\nachieve net-zero carbon emissions goals or interim emissions reduction goals\n; general economic, geopolitical and business conditions in key regions of the world; foreign currency risk; pricing pressure; inflation; weather and seasonal factors; unfavorable effects of health pandemics; availability and cost of raw materials; operational modifications, delays or cancellations; challenges in Schlumberger’s supply chain; production declines; Schlumberger’s inability to recognize\nefficiencies and other\nintended benefits from its business strategies and initiatives, such as digital or Schlumberger New Energy, as well as its cost reduction strategies; changes in government regulations and regulatory requirements, including those related to offshore oil and gas exploration, radioactive sources, explosives, chemicals and climate-related initiatives; the inability of technology to meet new challenges in exploration; the competitiveness of alternative energy sources or product substitutes; and other risks and uncertainties detailed in this Form 10-K and other filings that we make with the SEC.  If one or more of these or other risks or uncertainties materialize (or the consequences of any such development changes), or should our underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results or outcomes may vary materially from those reflected in our forward-looking statements.  Forward-looking and other statements in this Form 10-K regarding our environmental, social and other sustainability plans and goals are not an indication that these statements are necessarily material to investors or required to be disclosed in our filings with the SEC. In addition, historical, current, and forward-looking environmental, social and sustainability-related statements may be based on standards for measuring progress that are still developing, internal controls and processes that continue to evolve, and assumptions that are subject to change in the future.

revenue recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time; recoverability of fixed assets, goodwill, intangible assets, Asset Performance Solutions investments and investments in affiliates; income taxes; multiclient seismic data; contingencies and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans.  Schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nRevenue Recognition\nSchlumberger recognizes revenue upon the transfer of control of promised products or services to customers at an amount that reflects the consideration it expects to receive in exchange for these products or services.  The vast majority of Schlumberger’s services and product offerings are short-term in nature.  The time between invoicing and when payment is due under these arrangements is generally between\n30\nto\n60\ndays\n.\nRevenue is occasionally generated from contractual arrangements that include multiple performance obligations.  Revenue from these arrangements is allocated to each performance obligation based on its relative standalone selling price.  Standalone selling prices are generally determined based on the prices charged to customers or using expected costs plus margin.\nRevenue is recognized for certain long-term construction-type contracts over time.  These contracts involve significant design and engineering efforts in order to satisfy custom designs for customer-specific applications.  Revenue is recognized as work progresses on each contract.  Progress is measured by the ratio of actual costs incurred to date on the project in relation to total estimated project costs.  The estimate of total project costs has a significant impact on both the amount of revenue recognized as well as the related profit on a project.  Revenue and profits on contracts can also be significantly affected by change orders and claims.  Due to the nature of these projects, adjustments to estimates of contract revenue and total contract costs may be required as work progresses.  Progress billings are generally issued upon completion of certain phases of work as stipulated in the contract.  Any expected losses on a project are recorded in full in the period in which they become probable.\nDue to the nature of its businesses, Schlumberger does not have significant backlog.  Total backlog was $\n2.8\nbillion at December 31, 2021, of which approximately\n50\n% is expected to be recognized as revenue during 2022.\nShort-term Investments\nShort-term investments\nare comprised primarily of money market funds, time deposits, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, bonds and notes, substantially all of which are denominated in US dollars and are stated at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value.\nFor purposes of the\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\n, Schlumberger does not consider\nShort-term investments\nto be cash equivalents.\n36\nInvestments in Affiliated Companies\nInvestments in companies in which Schlumberger does not have a controlling financial interest, but over which it has significant influence, are accounted for using the equity method.  Schlumberger’s share of the after-tax earnings of equity method investees is included in\nInterest & other income\n.  Investments in privately held companies in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are accounted for using the cost method.  Investments in publicly traded companies in which Schlumberger does not have the ability to exercise significant influence are reported at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of\nInterest & other income\n.\nMulticlient Seismic Data\nSchlumberger’s multiclient library consists of completed and in-process seismic surveys that are licensed on a nonexclusive basis.  Schlumberger capitalizes costs directly incurred in acquiring and processing the multiclient seismic data.  Such costs are charged to\nCost of services\nbased on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that Schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data.  However, an individual survey generally will not carry a net book value greater than a 4-year, straight-line amortized value.\nThe carrying value of the multiclient library is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicating impairment may have occurred.  Adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future cash flows, which involve significant judgment on the part of Schlumberger, would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys.  Significant adverse changes in Schlumberger’s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period.\nAsset Performance Solutions\nAsset Performance Solutions (“APS”) projects are generally focused on developing and co-managing production of customers’ assets under long-term agreements.  Schlumberger invests its own services and products into the field development activities and operations and is compensated on a fee-per-barrel basis or based on cash flow generated.  This includes certain arrangements whereby Schlumberger is only compensated based on incremental production that it helps deliver above a mutually agreed baseline.\nSchlumberger capitalizes its investments in a project including the direct costs associated with providing its services or products.  These capitalized investments are amortized to the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nas the related production is achieved based on the units of production method, whereby each unit produced is assigned a pro-rata portion of the unamortized costs based on estimated total production, resulting in a matching of revenue with the applicable costs.\nConcentration of Credit Risk\nSchlumberger’s assets that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash, short-term investments, receivables from clients and derivative financial instruments.  Schlumberger places its cash and short-term investments with financial institutions and corporations and limits the amount of credit exposure with any one of them.  Schlumberger regularly evaluates the creditworthiness of the issuers in which it invests.  By using derivative financial instruments to hedge certain exposures, Schlumberger exposes itself to some credit risk.  Schlumberger minimizes this credit risk by entering into transactions with high-quality counterparties, limiting the exposure to each counterparty and monitoring the financial condition of its counterparties.\nSchlumberger generates revenue in more than\n120\ncountries and as such, its accounts receivable are spread over many countries and customers.  The United States represented\n12\n% of Schlumberger’s net accounts receivable balance at December 31, 2021.\nNo\nother country accounted for greater than 10% of Schlumberger’s accounts receivable balance.  Schlumberger maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable based on expected collectability and performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers’ financial condition.  If the financial condition of Schlumberger’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments, adjustments to the allowance may be required.\n37\nEarnings per Share\nThe following is a reconciliation from basic to diluted earnings (loss) per share of Schlumberger for each of the last three years:\nThe number of outstanding employee stock options to purchase shares of Schlumberger common stock and unvested restricted stock units that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings/loss per share, because to do so would have had an anti-dilutive effect, were as follows:\n3.\nCharges and Credits\n2021\nSchlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during 2021:\nThird quarter 2021:\n38\nFourth quarter 2021:\nAs of December 31, 2021, Schlumberger had a\n31\n% equity interest in Liberty.  Based on the quoted market prices of Liberty’s shares, the fair value of Schlumberger’s investment in Liberty was approximately\n$\n550\nmillion as of December 31, 2021.  Schlumberger accounts for its investment in Liberty under the equity method of accounting and records its share of Liberty’s net income or loss on a one-quarter lag.\n39\n2020\nSchlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during 2020, all of which, unless otherwise noted, are classified in\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n:\nFirst quarter 2020:\nSchlumberger had\n11\nreporting units with goodwill balances aggregating $\n16.0\nbillion.  Schlumberger determined that the fair value of\nfour\nof its reporting units, representing $\n4.5\nbillion of goodwill, was substantially in excess of their carrying value.  Schlumberger performed a detailed quantitative impairment assessment of the remaining\nseven\nreporting units, which represented $\n11.5\nbillion of goodwill.  As a result of this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that the goodwill associated with each of these seven reporting units was impaired, resulting in a $\n3.1\nbillion goodwill impairment charge.\nFollowing the $3.1 billion goodwill impairment charge relating to these seven reporting units,\nsix\nof these reporting units had a remaining goodwill balance.  These goodwill balances ranged between $\n0.2\nbillion and $\n5.0\nbillion and aggregated to $\n8.4\nbillion as of March 31, 2020.\n40\nSchlumberger used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, but also considered the market approach to validate the results.  The income approach estimates the fair value by discounting each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows using Schlumberger’s estimate of the discount rate, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date.  The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results.  The market approach involves significant judgement involved in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples.\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows for each reporting unit and the discount rate.  Schlumberger selected the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates.  Schlumberger’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.  However, given the inherent uncertainty in determining the assumptions underlying a discounted cash flow analysis, particularly in a volatile market, actual results may differ from those used in Schlumberger’s valuations which could result in additional impairment charges in the future.\nThe discount rates utilized to value Schlumberger’s reporting units were between\n12.0\n% and\n13.5\n%, depending on the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit as well as the size of the reporting unit.  Assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a\n50\n-basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate assumptions would have changed the fair value of the\nseven\nreporting units, on average, by less than\n5\n%.\nSecond quarter 2020:\n41\nThird quarter 2020:\nFourth quarter 2020:\n2019\nSchlumberger recorded the following charges and credits during 2019, all of which are classified as\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n, except for the gain on the formation of the Sensia joint venture:\n42\nThird quarter of 2019:\nAs a result of these facts, Schlumberger determined that it was more likely than not that the fair value of certain of its reporting units was less than their carrying value.  Therefore, Schlumberger performed an interim goodwill impairment test as of August 31, 2019.\nAs of August 31, 2019, Schlumberger had\n17\nreporting units with goodwill balances aggregating $\n25.0\nbillion.  Schlumberger determined that the fair value of\nseven\nof its reporting units, representing approximately $\n13.8\nbillion of the goodwill, was substantially in excess of their carrying value.  Schlumberger performed a detailed quantitative impairment assessment of the remaining\n10\nreporting units, which represented $\n11.2\nbillion of goodwill.  As a result of this assessment, Schlumberger concluded that the goodwill associated with\nnine\nof the 10 reporting units was impaired, resulting in an $\n8.8\nbillion goodwill impairment charge.\nSchlumberger primarily used the income approach to estimate the fair value of its reporting units, but also considered the market approach to validate the results.  The income approach estimates the fair value by discounting each reporting unit’s estimated future cash flows using Schlumberger’s estimate of the discount rate, or expected return, that a marketplace participant would have required as of the valuation date.  The market approach includes the use of comparative multiples to corroborate the discounted cash flow results.  The market approach involves significant judgement involved in the selection of the appropriate peer group companies and valuation multiples.\nSome of the more significant assumptions inherent in the income approach include the estimated future net annual cash flows for each reporting unit and the discount rate.  Schlumberger selected the assumptions used in the discounted cash flow projections using historical data supplemented by current and anticipated market conditions and estimated growth rates.  Schlumberger’s estimates are based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable.\nThe discount rates utilized to value Schlumberger’s reporting units were between\n12.5\n% and\n14.0\n%, depending on the risks and uncertainty inherent in the respective reporting unit.  Assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a\n50\nbasis point increase in the discount rate assumption would have increased the goodwill impairment charge by approximately $\n0.3\nbillion.  Conversely, assuming all other assumptions and inputs used in each of the respective discounted cash flow analysis were held constant, a\n50\nbasis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would have decreased the goodwill impairment charge by approximately $\n0.4\nbillion.\nRecoverability testing, which was performed as of August 31, 2019, indicated that long-lived assets associated with certain asset groups were impaired.  The estimated fair value of these asset groups was determined to be below their carrying value.  As a result, Schlumberger recorded the following impairment and related charges:\n43\nFourth quarter of 2019:\nThe fair value of certain of the assets impaired during 2020 and 2019 was estimated based on the present value of projected future cash flows that the underlying assets are expected to generate.  Such estimates included unobservable inputs that required significant judgment.\n4.\nInventories\nInventories, which are stated at the lower of average cost or net realizable value, consist of the following:\n44\n5.\nFixed Assets\nFixed assets consist of the following:\nThe estimated useful lives of Buildings & improvements are primarily\n25\nto\n30\nyears\n.  The estimated useful lives of Machinery & equipment are primarily\n5\nto\n10\nyears\n.\nDepreciation expense, which is recorded on a straight-line basis, was $\n1.4\nbillion, $\n1.6\nbillion and $\n2.0\nbillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n6.\nGoodwill\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:\nIn connection with a change in reportable segments, Schlumberger reallocated its goodwill as of September 30, 2020 to its new segments on a relative fair value basis:\n45\n7.\nIntangible Assets\nIntangible assets consist of the following:\nCustomer relationships are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n18\nto\n28\nyears\n, technology/technical know-how are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n10\nto\n18\nyears\n, and tradenames are generally amortized over periods ranging from\n15\nto\n30\nyears\n.\nAmortization expense was $\n302\nmillion in 2021, $\n371\nmillion in 2020 and $\n618\nmillion in 2019.\nBased on the carrying value of intangible assets at December 31, 2021, amortization expense for the subsequent five years is estimated to be as follows: 2022: $\n291\nmillion, 2023: $\n281\nmillion, 2024: $\n264\nmillion, 2025: $\n249\nmillion and 2026: $\n245\nmillion.\n8.\nLong-term Debt and Debt Facility Agreements\nLong-term Debt\nconsists of the following:\nAt December 31, 2021, Schlumberger had committed credit facility agreements with commercial banks aggregating $\n5.75\nbillion, all of which\nwas available and unused.  These committed facilities support commercial paper programs in the United States and Europe,\n46\nof which\n$\n2.75\nbillion matures in February 2023, $\n2.0\nbillion matures in February 2025 and $\n1.0\nbillion matures in July\n2026\n.  Schlumberger also has a €\n750\nm\nillion\nthree-year\ncommitted revolving credit facility\nthat matures\nin June 2024\n.\nAt\nDecember 31,\n2021\n,\nno amounts had been drawn under this facility. Interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary by facility.\nCommercial paper borrowings are classified as long-term debt to the extent they are backed up by available and unused committed credit facilities maturing in more than one year and to the extent it is Schlumberger’s intent to maintain these obligations for longer than one year.  There were\nno\nborrowings under the commercial paper programs at December 31, 2021.  At December 31, 2020, borrowings under the commercial paper programs were $\n0.4\nbillion, all of which was classified in\nLong-term Debt\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nLong-term Debt\nas of December 31, 2021 is due as follows:\n$\n1.6\nbillion in 2023, $\n1.4\nbillion in 2024, $\n1.4\nbillion in 2025, $\n1.8\nbillion in 2026, $\n1.0\nbillion in 2027, $\n1.5\nbillion in 2028 and $\n4.6\nbillion thereafter.\nThe fair value of Schlumberger’s\nLong-term Debt\nat December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 was $\n13.9\nbillion and $\n17.3\nbillion, respectively, and was estimated based on quoted market prices.\nSchlumberger Limited fully and unconditionally guarantees the securities issued by certain of its subsidiaries, including securities issued by Schlumberger Investment SA and Schlumberger Finance Canada Ltd., both wholly-owned subsidiaries of Schlumberger Limited.\n9.\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nAs a multinational company, Schlumberger conducts its business in over\n120\ncountries.  Schlumberger’s functional currency is primarily the US dollar.  Approximately\n70\n% of Schlumberger’s revenues in 2021 were denominated in US dollars.  However, outside the United States, a significant portion of Schlumberger’s expenses is incurred in foreign currencies.  Therefore, when the US dollar weakens (strengthens) in relation to the foreign currencies of the countries in which Schlumberger conducts business, the US dollar-reported expenses will increase (decrease).\nSchlumberger is exposed to risks on future cash flows to the extent that the local currency is not the functional currency and expenses denominated in local currency are not equal to revenues denominated in local currency.  Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts to provide a hedge against a portion of these cash flow risks.  These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss.\nAmounts recorded in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nare reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nSchlumberger is also exposed to risks on future cash flows relating to certain of its fixed rate debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  Schlumberger uses cross-currency swaps to provide a hedge against these cash flow risks.  Included in\nOther Assets\nwas $\n66\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n427\nmillion at December 31, 2020) and included in\nOther Liabilities\nwas $\n78\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n13\nmillion at December 31, 2020) relating to the fair value of outstanding cross-currency swap derivatives.  The fair value was determined using a model with inputs that are observable in the market or can be derived or collaborated by observable data.\nDuring 2019, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued €\n1.5\nbillion of Euro-denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of €\n1.5\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its €\n0.5\nbillion\n0.00\n% Notes due 2024, €\n0.5\nbillion\n0.25\n% Notes due 2027 and €\n0.5\nbillion\n0.50\n% Notes due 2031.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of\n2.29\n%,\n2.51\n% and\n2.76\n%, respectively.\nDuring 2020, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued €\n0.8\nbillion of Euro-denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of €\n0.8\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its €\n0.4\nbillion of\n0.25\n% Notes due 2027 and €\n0.4\nbillion of\n0.50\n% Notes due 2031.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of\n1.87\n% and\n2.20\n%, respectively.\nDuring 2020, a US-dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued €\n2.0\nbillion of Euro-denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of €\n2.0\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its €\n1.0\nbillion of\n1.375\n% Guaranteed Notes due 2026 and €\n1.0\nbillion of\n2.00\n% Guaranteed Notes due 2032.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the swapped portion of the Euro-denominated notes to US-dollar denominated debt with fixed annual interest rates of\n2.77\n% and\n3.49\n%, respectively.\n47\nDuring 2020, a Canadian dollar functional currency subsidiary of Schlumberger issued $\n0.5\nbillion of US dollar denominated debt.  Schlumberger entered into cross-currency swaps for an aggregate notional amount of $\n0.5\nbillion in order to hedge changes in the fair value of its $\n0.5\nbillion\n1.40\n% Senior Notes due 2025.  These cross-currency swaps effectively convert the US dollar notes to Canadian dollar denominated debt with a fixed annual interest rate of\n1.73\n%.\nSchlumberger is exposed to changes in the fair value of assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.  While Schlumberger uses foreign currency forward contracts to economically hedge this exposure as it relates to certain currencies, these contracts are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes.  Instead, the fair value of the contracts is recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand changes in the fair value are recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss),\nas are changes in the fair value of the hedged item.  Transaction losses of $\n23\nmillion in 2021 and $\n21\nmillion in 2020 and transaction gains of $\n2\nmillion in 2019 were recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nnet of related hedging activities.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Schlumberger entered into derivative contracts that hedge the price of oil relating to approximately\n75\n% of the projected 2022 oil production of one of its APS projects. These contracts are accounted for as cash flow hedges, with the changes in the fair value of the hedge recorded on the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nand in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n. Amounts recorded in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nwill be reclassified to earnings in the same period or periods that the hedged item is recognized in earnings.\nNo\namounts were recognized in the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nrelating to these hedging activities during 2021.\nAt December 31, 2021, contracts were outstanding for the US dollar equivalent of $\n7.7\nbillion in various foreign currencies, of which $\n6.0\nbillion relates to hedges of debt denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.\nOther than the previously mentioned cross-currency swaps, the fair value of the other outstanding derivatives was\nno\nt material at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe effect of derivative instruments designated as hedges and those not designated as hedges on the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\nwas as follows:\nSchlumberger does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes.\n10.\nStockholders’ Equity\nSchlumberger is authorized to issue\n4,500,000,000\nshares of common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, of which\n1,403,381,685\nand\n1,392,325,960\nshares were outstanding on December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.  Holders of common stock are entitled to one vote for each share of stock held.  Schlumberger is also authorized to issue\n200,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, which may be issued in series with terms and conditions determined by the Schlumberger Board of Directors.\nNo\nshares of preferred stock have been issued.\n48\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nconsists of the following:\n11.\nStock-based Compensation Plans\nSchlumberger has three types of stock-based compensation programs: (i) stock options, (ii) a restricted stock, restricted stock unit and performance share unit program (collectively referred to as “restricted stock”), and (iii) a discounted stock purchase plan (“DSPP”).\nStock Options\nKey employees may be granted stock options under Schlumberger stock option plans.  The exercise price equals the average of the high and low sales prices of Schlumberger stock on the date of grant.  The maximum term is\n10\nyears, and the options generally vest in increments\nover five years\n.\nThe fair value of each stock option grant was estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following weighted-average assumptions and resulting weighted-average fair value per share:\nThere were\nno\nstock option grants during 2021.\nThe following table summarizes information related to options outstanding and options exercisable as of December 31, 2021:\nThe weighted-average remaining contractual life of stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2021 was\n3.3\nyears.\n49\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nStock options outstanding and stock options exercisable as of December 31, 2021 had\nno\nintrinsic value.\nRestricted Stock\nSchlumberger grants performance share units to certain key employees.  The number of shares earned is determined at the end of each performance period based on Schlumberger’s achievement of certain predefined targets as described in the underlying performance share unit agreement.  In the event Schlumberger exceeds the predefined target, shares for up to a maximum of\n250\n% of the target award may be awarded.  In the event Schlumberger falls below the predefined target, a reduced number of shares may be awarded.  If Schlumberger falls below the threshold award performance level,\nno\nshares will be awarded.  As of December 31, 2021,\n4.9\nmillion performance share units were outstanding assuming the achievement of 100% of target.\nAll other restricted stock awards generally vest at the end of\nthree years\nor vest ratably in equal tranches over a three-year period.\nRestricted stock awards do not pay dividends or have voting rights prior to vesting.  Accordingly, the fair value of a restricted stock award is generally the quoted market price of Schlumberger’s stock on the date of grant less the present value of the expected dividends not received prior to vesting.\nThe following table summarizes information related to restricted stock transactions:\nDiscounted Stock Purchase Plan\nUnder the terms of the DSPP, employees can choose to have a portion of their earnings withheld, subject to certain restrictions, to purchase Schlumberger common stock.  The purchase price of the stock is\n92.5\n% of the lower of the stock price at the beginning or end of the plan period at six-month intervals.\n50\nThe fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the DSPP was estimated using the Black-Scholes model with the following assumptions and resulting weighted-average fair value per share:\nTotal Stock-based Compensation Expense\nThe following summarizes stock-based compensation expense recognized in income:\nAt December 31, 2021, there was $\n277\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to nonvested stock-based compensation arrangements, of which $\n171\nmillion is expected to be recognized in 2022, $\n90\nmillion in 2023, $\n15\nmillion in 2024, and $\n1\nmillion in 2025.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately\n44\nmillion shares of Schlumberger common stock were available for future grants under Schlumberger’s stock-based compensation programs.\n12.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome (loss) before taxes\nsubject to United States and non-United States income taxes was as follows:\nSchlumberger recorded net pretax credits of $\n65\nmillion in 2021 ($\n75\nmillion of credits in the US and $\n10\nmillion of charges outside the US). Schlumberger recorded net pretax charges of $\n12.515\nbillion in 2020 ($\n3.961\nbillion in the US and $\n8.554\nbillion outside the US); and $\n12.901\nbillion in 2019 ($\n8.769\nbillion in the US and $\n4.132\nbillion outside the US).  These charges and credits are included in the table above and are more fully described in Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.\n51\nThe components of net deferred tax assets (liabilities) were as follows:\nThe deferred tax balances at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were net of valuation allowances relating to net operating losses in certain countries of $\n133\nmillion and $\n127\nmillion, respectively.  Additionally, the deferred tax balances were net of valuation allowances relating to the following:\nApproximately $\n390\nmillion of the $\n427\nmillion deferred tax asset relating to net operating losses at December 31, 2021 can be carried forward indefinitely.  The vast majority of the remaining balance expires at various dates between\n2030\nand\n2040\n.\nThe components of\nTax expense (benefit)\nwere as follows:\nA reconciliation of the United States statutory federal tax rate to the consolidated effective tax rate follows:\nA number of the jurisdictions in which Schlumberger operates have tax laws that are not fully defined and are evolving.  Schlumberger’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities.  These audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or, potentially, through the courts.  Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of\n52\nadditional taxes\nthat\nwill be due upon the conclusion of these audits.\nDue to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe amounts above exclude accrued interest and penalties of $\n164\nmillion, $\n184\nmillion and $\n188\nmillion at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.  Schlumberger classifies interest and penalties relating to uncertain tax positions within\nTax expense\n(benefit)\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n.\nThe following table summarizes the tax years that are either currently under audit or remain open and subject to examination by the tax authorities in the most significant jurisdictions in which Schlumberger operates:\n13.\nLeases\nSchlumberger’s leasing activities primarily consist of operating leases for administrative offices, manufacturing facilities, research centers, service centers, sales offices and certain equipment.  Total operating lease expense, which approximates cash paid and includes short-term leases, was $\n1.2\nbillion in 2021, $\n1.4\nbillion in 2020 and $\n1.7\nbillion in 2019.\n53\nMaturities of operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021 were as follows:\nOperating lease assets of $\n0.6\nbillion and $\n0.7\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were included in\nOther Assets\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.  Operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2020 were $\n1.0\nbillion, of which $\n0.2\nbillion was classified in\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nand $\n0.8\nbillion was classified in\nOther Liabilities\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet.\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term as of December 31, 2021 was\n10\nyears.  The weighted-average discount rate used to determine the operating lease liability as of December 31, 2021 was\n3.1\n%.\n14.\nContingencies\nSchlumberger is party to various legal proceedings from time to time.  A liability is accrued when a loss is both probable and can be reasonably estimated.  Management believes that the probability of a material loss with respect to any currently pending legal proceeding is remote.  However, litigation is inherently uncertain, and it is not possible to predict the ultimate disposition of any of these proceedings.\n15.\nSegment Information\nSchlumberger is organized under four Divisions that combine and integrate Schlumberger’s technologies, enhancing the Company’s ability to support the emerging long-term growth opportunities in each of these market segments.\nThe four Divisions, representing Schlumberger’s segments, are:\n54\nFinancial information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, by segment, is as follows:\n55\nSegment assets consist of receivables, inventories, fixed assets, multiclient seismic data and APS investments.\nCapital investments includes capital expenditures, APS investments and multiclient seismic data cost capitalized.\nDepreciation and amortization includes depreciation of property, plant and equipment and amortization of intangible assets, multiclient seismic data costs and APS investments.\nRevenue\nby geographic area\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nRevenue is based on the location where services are provided and products are sold.\nDuring each of the three years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no single customer exceeded 10% of consolidated revenue.\nSchlumberger did not have revenue from third-party customers in its country of domicile during the last three years.  Revenue in the United States in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n3.4\nbillion, $\n4.5\nbillion and $\n9.3\nbillion, respectively.\n56\nNorth America and International revenue disaggregated by segment was as follows:\nFixed Assets less accumulated depreciation\nby geographic area are as follows:\n57\n16.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nPension Plans\nSchlumberger sponsors several defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all US employees hired prior to October 1, 2004.  The benefits are based on years of service and compensation, on a career-average pay basis.\nIn addition to the US defined benefit pension plans, Schlumberger sponsors several other international defined benefit pension plans.  The most significant of these international plans are the International Staff Pension Plan and the UK pension plan (collectively, the “International plans”).  The International Staff Pension Plan covers certain international employees hired prior to July 1, 2014 and is based on years of service and compensation on a career-average pay basis.  The UK plan covers employees hired prior to April 1, 1999, and is based on years of service and compensation, on a final salary basis.\nThe weighted-average assumed discount rate, compensation increases and expected long-term rate of return on plan assets used to determine the net pension cost for the US and International plans were as follows:\nNet pension cost (credit) included the following components:\nDuring 2019, certain of Schlumberger’s deferred benefit pension plans offered former Schlumberger employees, who had not yet commenced receiving their pension benefits, an opportunity to receive a lump sum payout of their vested pension benefit.  Schlumberger’s pension plans paid $\n257\nmillion from pension plan assets to those who accepted this offer, thereby reducing its pension benefit obligations.  These transactions resulted in a non-cash pension settlement charge of $\n37\nmillion, representing the immediate recognition of the related deferred actuarial losses in\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\n, in the fourth quarter of 2019.  See Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.\nThe weighted-average assumed discount rate and compensation increases used to determine the projected benefit obligations for the US and International plans were as follows:\n58\nThe changes in the projected benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of the plans were as follows:\nThe asset / (unfunded liability) represents the difference between the plan assets and the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”).  The PBO represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation and includes an assumption about future compensation levels.  The accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) represents the actuarial present value of benefits based on employee service and compensation but does not include an assumption about future compensation levels.\nActuarial gains arising during 2021 and actuarial losses arising during 2020 were primarily attributable to changes in the discount rate used to determine the PBO.\nThe weighted-average allocation of plan assets and the target allocations by asset category as of December 31, 2021 are as follows:\nAsset performance is monitored frequently with an overall expectation that plan assets will meet or exceed the weighted index of its target asset allocation and component benchmark over rolling\nfive-year\nperiods.\n59\nThe expected rate of return on assets assumptions reflect the long-term average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested.  The assumptions have been determined based on expectations regarding future rates of return for the portfolio considering the asset allocation and related historical rates of return.  The appropriateness of the assumptions is reviewed annually.\nThe fair value of Schlumberger’s pension plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, by asset category, is presented below and was determined based on valuation techniques categorized as follows:\n60\nSchlumberger’s funding policy is to annually contribute amounts that are based upon a number of factors including the actuarial accrued liability, amounts that are deductible for income tax purposes, legal funding requirements and available cash flow. Schlumberger does not expect to make any material contributions\nto its postretirement benefit plans in 2022.\nPostretirement Benefits Other Than Pensions\nSchlumberger provides healthcare benefits to certain former US employees who have retired.\nThe actuarial assumptions used to determine the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation and net periodic benefit cost for the US postretirement medical plan were as follows:\nThe net periodic benefit credit for the US postretirement medical plan included the following components:\n61\nDue to the actions taken by Schlumberger to reduce its global workforce during 2020, Schlumberger experienced a significant reduction in the expected aggregate years of future service of its employees in its US postretirement medical plan. Accordingly, Schlumberger recorded a curtailment gain of $\n69\nmillion during the second quarter of 2020 relating to this plan. The curtailment gain includes recognition of the decrease in the benefit obligation as well as a portion of the previously unrecognized prior service credit, reflecting the reduction in expected years of future service.  As a result of the curtailment, Schlumberger performed a remeasurement of the plan, which had an immaterial impact.  This gain was classified in\nImpairments & other\nin the\nConsolidated Statement of Income (Loss)\n.  See Note 3 –\nCharges and Credits\n.\nThe changes in the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status were as follows:\nThe asset balance relating to this plan was included in\nOther Assets\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nThe assets of the US postretirement medical plan are invested\n13\n% in equity securities and\n87\n% in debt securities at December 31, 2021.  The fair value of these assets was primarily determined based on Level Two valuation techniques.\nOther Information\nThe expected benefits to be paid under the US and International pension plans as well as the postretirement medical plan are as follows:\n62\n17.\nSupplementary Information\nCash paid for interest and income taxes was as follows:\nInterest and other income\nincludes the following:\nThe components of depreciation and amortization expense are as follows:\nThe change in\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\nis as follows:\n63\nRevenue in excess of billings related to contracts where revenue is recognized over time was $\n0.2\nbillion at both December 31, 2021 and 2020.  Such amounts are included within\nReceivables less allowance for doubtful accounts\nin the\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\n.\nOther Assets\nconsist of the following:\nAccounts payable and accrued liabilities\nconsist of the following:\n64\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nSchlumberger management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a–15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).  Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.  Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nSchlumberger management assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021.  In making this assessment, it used the criteria set forth in 2013 by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework.\nBased on this assessment Schlumberger’s management has concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, its internal control over financial reporting is effective based on those criteria.\nThe effectiveness of Schlumberger’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 has been audited by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which appears herein.\n65\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders\nof Schlumberger Limited\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheet of Schlumberger Limited and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the related consolidated statements of income (loss), comprehensive income (loss), stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n66\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nUncertain Tax Positions\nAs described in Note 12 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company’s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities, and those audits may result in assessments for additional taxes that are resolved with the tax authorities or, potentially, through the courts. Tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes that will be due upon the conclusion of these audits.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to uncertain tax positions is a critical audit matter are the significant judgment applied by management in determining these liabilities including a high degree of estimation uncertainty due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s estimates.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the identification and recognition of uncertain tax positions. These procedures also included, among others (i) evaluating management’s process for determining the estimated liabilities for uncertain tax positions, (ii) testing the completeness and reasonableness of uncertain tax positions recorded in the consolidated financial statements, and (iii) evaluating assessments received from the relevant tax authorities. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in evaluating the reasonableness of assumptions used by management, including management’s assessment of whether tax positions are more-likely-than-not of being sustained.\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1952.\n67"
