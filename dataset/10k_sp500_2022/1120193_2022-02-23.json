    "text": "Overview\nNasdaq is a global technology company serving the capital markets and other industries. Our diverse offerings of data, analytics, software and services enables clients to optimize and execute their business vision with confidence.\nWe manage, operate and provide our products and services in four business segments: Market Technology, Investment Intelligence, Corporate Platforms and Market Services.\nHistory\nNasdaq was founded in 1971 as a wholly-owned subsidiary of FINRA. Beginning in 2000, FINRA restructured and broadened ownership in Nasdaq by selling shares to FINRA members, investment companies and issuers listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market. In connection with this restructuring, FINRA fully divested its ownership of Nasdaq in 2006, and The Nasdaq Stock Market became an independent registered national securities exchange in 2007.\nIn February 2008, Nasdaq and OMX AB combined their businesses, and we changed our corporate name to The NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. This transformational combination resulted in the expansion of our business from a U.S.-based exchange operator to a global exchange company offering technology that powers our own exchanges and markets as well as many other marketplaces around the world. We operated as the NASDAQ OMX Group until we rebranded our business as Nasdaq, Inc. in 2015.\nGrowth Strategy\nTo ensure our continued success in the evolving business environment, we have established a clear and consistent vision, mission, purpose and strategy:\nOur Vision\n: To reimagine markets to realize the potential of tomorrow.\nOur Mission\n: To provide the premier platform and ecosystem for global capital markets and beyond with unmatched technology, insights and markets expertise.\nOur Purpose\n: To champion inclusive growth and prosperity. We power stronger economies, create more equitable opportunities and contribute to a more sustainable world to help our communities, clients, employees and people of all backgrounds reach their full potential.\nOur Strategy\n:\nUnder the strategic direction that we have been implementing over the past five years, we have focused on maximizing the resources, people and capital allocated to our largest growth opportunities. These opportunities, which include anti-financial crime and market infrastructure technology solutions, analytics and workflows for investment managers and asset owners, and ESG solutions, constitute large and growing opportunities where we feel our strengths in technology, analytics and capital markets expertise, combined with our expansive client network, position us to meet our clients’ evolving needs. We are also committed to investing to maintain the strong competitive positioning of our foundational marketplace and corporate businesses, as well as over time reducing capital allocated to areas that we believe are less strategic to our clients and which have less long-term growth potential within Nasdaq.\nOur four business segments reflect our broad capabilities, with Market Technology and Investment Intelligence providing our technology and analytics growth platform, and Corporate Platforms and Market Services serving as our foundational marketplace core.\n•\nIncreasing Investment in Businesses Where We See the Highest Growth Opportunity\n. We have increased investment in fast-growing markets that we believe help solve our clients’ biggest challenges and are likely to generate growth for our stockholders. These areas include: the index and analytics business within our Investment Intelligence segment; broader governance technology and consultative solutions, including ESG-focused solutions, within our Corporate Platforms segment; and anti-financial crime solutions and trade surveillance in our Market Technology segment.\n1\nIn February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Verafin, a provider of anti-financial crime management solutions, which is part of our Market Technology segment. We are continuing to invest in the Market Technology segment through the expansion, enhancement, and flexibility of our technology platform, in addition to leveraging emerging technologies such as machine intelligence in our Trade Surveillance offering.\nIn December 2021, we completed the acquisition of QDiligence, a provider of software that facilitates digital director and officer questionnaires and self-evaluations for directors and corporate secretaries. We plan to integrate QDiligence as part of the Nasdaq Governance Solutions business.\n•\nEnhancing Our Foundation.\nAs we strive to grow our business, we have also focused on enhancing our leadership position in the marketplaces in which we operate as we continue to innovate with new functionality and strong market share in our core markets. In December 2021, we announced a multi-year partnership with Amazon Web Services, or AWS, to migrate our North American exchanges to the cloud. Nasdaq will utilize a new edge computing solution that was co-designed by Nasdaq and AWS for market infrastructure. The partnership with AWS will also further our strategy with our market infrastructure clients, including banks, clearing houses, central securities depositories and regulators that rely on us for their core trading, clearing and settlement and surveillance technology. We believe these offerings can provide such clients with added agility in adjusting to changing industry dynamics. We plan to work with AWS to develop viable cloud choices that include public-cloud and hybrid models. The collaboration with AWS also includes opportunities to explore other ways to leverage AWS’s cloud capabilities across our other businesses, including our anti-financial crime and data and analytics businesses.\n•\nOptimizing Slower Growth Businesses\n. We continually review areas that are not critical to our core. In June 2021, we sold our U.S. Fixed Income business. This transaction aligns with our strategy to concentrate our resources and capital in order to maximize our potential as a major technology and analytics provider to the global capital markets. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this transaction.\nProducts and Services\nMarket Technology\nPowering over 130 market infrastructure operators and new market clients in more than 55 countries, our Market Technology business is a leading global technology solutions provider and partner to exchanges, clearing organizations, central securities depositories, regulators, banks, brokers, buy-side firms and corporate businesses. Our solutions can handle a wide array of assets, including but not limited to cash equities, equity derivatives, currencies, various interest-bearing securities, commodities, energy products and digital currencies. Our solutions can also be used in the creation of new asset classes, and non-capital markets customers, including those in insurance liabilities securitization, cryptocurrencies and sports wagering.\nNasdaq’s market technology is utilized by leading markets in the U.S., Europe and Asia as well as emerging markets in the Middle East, Latin America, and Africa. Additionally, more than 220 market participants leverage our surveillance technology globally to manage their integrity obligations and assist them in complying with market rules, regulations and internal market surveillance policies.\nDuring 2021, we continued to build out our SaaS business portfolio by extending and migrating our current offerings to SaaS. Across our product portfolio, ranging from our Marketplace Service Platform to our Surveillance offerings, we added more than 25 new SaaS customers\n.\nAdditionally, our Verafin solutions are offered to our clients entirely on a SaaS basis.\nOur Market Technology segment has evolved from its origins serving the capital markets, as we have leveraged NFF to develop our SaaS platform and offerings. We expect to continue to expand adoption by our clients of this SaaS model in the future.\n2\nAnti Financial Crime Technology\nIntegrity of markets is core to everything we do at Nasdaq. As such, we continue to extend our anti-financial crime strategy in the Market Technology segment. We have seen a growing demand globally for our products and services within the Anti Financial Crime Technology business. Our Nasdaq Trade Surveillance solution is a SaaS solution designed for brokers and other market participants to assist them in complying with market rules, regulations and internal market surveillance policies. We provide an anti-money laundering offering with an automated investigator tool for retail banks, the Nasdaq Automated Investigator. Verafin provides a cloud-based platform to help detect, investigate, and report money laundering and financial fraud to more than 2,100 financial institutions in North America.\nMarket Infrastructure Technology\nFor Market Infrastructure Operators, we provide and deliver mission-critical solutions across the trade lifecycle via the NFF, which is our flexible and modular architecture and technology that provides next generation capital markets capabilities in an open and agile environment. The NFF is designed to cover all aspects of a market operator’s needs, from trading and clearing to risk management, market surveillance, index development, data, management, testing, and quality assurance.\nRecently, we have seen a growing demand for our products and service outside of the traditional capital markets. Market Technology currently offers its services to several digital assets exchanges, two commercial real estate markets, the reinsurance market, and several sports wagering operators. Our Marketplaces Services Platform provides next-generation marketplace capabilities spanning the transaction lifecycle to facilitate the exchange of assets, services and information across various types of market ecosystems and machine-to-machine transactions. The Marketplaces Services Platform is targeted at new markets and enables end-to-end marketplace implementation without the resources required with on-premise solutions.\nMany Market Infrastructure projects involve complex delivery management and systems integration. Through our integration services, we can assume responsibility for projects that involve migration to a new system and the establishment of entirely new marketplaces. We also offer operation and support for the applications, systems platforms, networks and other components included in an information technology solution, as well as advisory services.\nInvestment Intelligence\nOur Investment Intelligence segment provides the global investing community with access to the financial markets together with strong investment insights.\nOur Investment Intelligence segment includes our Market Data, Index and Analytics businesses.\nFor both institutional and retail investors, our market and alternative data enhances transparency and access to the markets we operate, and we help guide investment decisions around the globe through our proprietary indexes and analytics.\nMarket Data\nOur Market Data business sells and distributes historical and real-time market data to the sell-side, the institutional investing community, retail online brokers, proprietary trading shops, other venues, internet portals and data distributors.\nOur market data products enhance transparency of market activity within our exchanges and provide critical information to professional and non-professional investors globally. We collect, process and create information and earn revenues as a distributor of our own, as well as select third-party content. We provide varying levels of quote and trade information to our customers who in turn provide subscriptions for this information. Our systems enable distributors to gain access to our market depth, fund valuation, order imbalances, market sentiment and other analytical data.\nWe distribute this proprietary market information to both market participants and non-participants through a number of proprietary products, including Nasdaq TotalView, our flagship market depth quote product. TotalView shows subscribers quotes, orders and total anonymous interest at every displayed price level in The Nasdaq Stock Market for Nasdaq-listed securities and critical data for the opening, closing, halt and IPO crosses. We also offer TotalView products for our Nasdaq BX, Nasdaq PSX, Nasdaq Fixed Income and other Nordic markets.\nWe operate several other proprietary services and data products to provide market information, including Nasdaq Basic, a low cost alternative to the industry Level 1 feed and Nasdaq Canada Basic, a low cost alternative to other high priced data feeds. We also provide various other data, including data relating to our six U.S. options exchanges, Nordic and U.S. futures, and Nordic commodities.\nOur Market Data business also includes revenues from U.S. tape plans. The plan administrators sell quotation and last sale information for all transactions in Nasdaq-listed securities, whether traded on The Nasdaq Stock Market or other exchanges, to market participants and to data distributors, who\nthen provide the information to subscribers. After deducting costs, the plan administrators distribute the tape revenues to the respective plan participants based on a formula required by Regulation NMS that takes into account both trading and quoting activity.\nThe Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges, as well as Nasdaq Commodities, also offer data products and services. These data products and services provide critical market transparency to professional and non-professional investors who participate in European marketplaces and, at the same time, give investors greater insight into these markets.\n3\nMuch like the U.S. products, European data products and services are based on trading information from the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges, as well as Nasdaq Commodities, for the following classes of assets: cash equities, bonds, derivatives and commodities. We provide varying levels of quote and trade information to market participants and to data distributors, who in turn provide subscriptions for this information. Significant European data products include Nordic Equity TotalView, Nordic Derivatives TotalView, and Nordic Fixed Income TotalView, Level 2 and Analytics.\nIndex\nOur Index business develops and licenses Nasdaq-branded indexes and financial products. License fees for our trademark licenses vary by product based on a percentage of underlying assets, dollar value of a product issuance, number of products or number of contracts traded. We also license cash-settled options, futures and options on futures on our indexes.\nAs of December 31, 2021, 362 ETPs listed on 25 exchanges in over 20 countries tracked a Nasdaq index and accounted for $424 billion in AUM. This includes approximately $94 billion in ETP AUM, or 22% of the total AUM that tracked our smart beta indexes during this same time period. Our flagship index, the Nasdaq-100 Index, includes the top 100 non-financial companies listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, and is tracked by more than 100 ETPs worldwide, and had nearly $300 billion in assets tracking the index as of December 31, 2021.\nWe provide index data products based on Nasdaq indexes. Index data products include our Global Index Data Service, which delivers real-time index values throughout the trading day, and Global Index Watch/Global Index File Delivery Service, which delivers daily as well as historical weightings and components data, corporate actions and a breadth of additional data for the indexes that we operate.\nNasdaq Dorsey Wright, or NDW, provides passive indexing and smart beta strategies to support the financial advisor community, as well as Systematic Relative Strength strategies to manage separately and unified managed accounts. NDW strengthens Nasdaq’s position as a leading smart beta index provider in the U.S.\nAnalytics\nOur Analytics business provides asset managers, investment consultants and institutional asset owners with information and analytics to make data-driven investment decisions, deploy their resources more productively, and provide liquidity solutions for private funds. Through our eVestment and Solovis solutions, we provide a suite of cloud-based solutions that help institutional investors and consultants conduct pre-investment due diligence, and monitor their portfolios post-investment. The eVestment platform also enables asset managers to efficiently distribute information about their firms and funds to asset owners and consultants worldwide.\nAdditionally, our Nasdaq Cloud Data Service provides a flexible and efficient method of delivery for real-time exchange data and other financial information. Data is made available through a suite of application programming interfaces, or APIs, allowing for the integration of data from disparate sources and a reduction in time to market for customer-designed applications. The API is highly scalable and can support the delivery of real-time exchange data.\nThrough the Solovis platform, endowments, foundations, pensions and family offices transform how they collect and aggregate investment data, analyze portfolio performance, model and predict future outcomes, and share meaningful portfolio insights with key stakeholders. The Nasdaq Fund Network and Nasdaq Data Link are additional platforms in our suite of investment data analytics offerings and data management tools. Nasdaq Fund Network gathers and distributes daily net asset values from over 35,000 funds and other investment vehicles across North America. We have extended Nasdaq Fund Network to support the distribution of collective investment trusts, hedge funds, managed accounts, separate accounts and demand deposit accounts. Nasdaq Data Link strengthens our position as a leading source for financial, economic, and alternative datasets. For investment management firms, investment banks and other investors, the platform powers data-driven decision-making for users across the globe via universal APIs, and provides for highly efficient data discovery and delivery.\nAdditionally, our Data Fabric solution, launched in 2021, enables investment firms to leverage the technology and team that powers Nasdaq Data Link to manage their own internal data with greater speed and efficiency.\nCorporate Platforms\nOur Corporate Platforms segment includes our Listing Services and IR & ESG Services businesses. These businesses deliver critical capital market and ESG solutions across the lifecycle of public and private companies.\nListing Services\nWe operate a variety of listing platforms around the world to provide multiple global capital raising solutions for public companies. Companies listed on our markets represent a diverse array of industries including, among others, health care, consumer products, telecommunication services, information technology, financial services, industrials and energy. Our main listing markets are The Nasdaq Stock Market and the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges.\nCompanies seeking to list securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market may do so on one of the three market tiers: The Nasdaq Global Select Market, The Nasdaq Global Market, or The Nasdaq Capital Market. To qualify, companies must meet minimum listing requirements, including specified financial and corporate governance criteria. Once listed, companies must maintain rigorous listing and corporate governance standards. We offer a suite of products to assist companies manage corporate governance standards, discussed below in “IR & ESG Services.”\n4\nAs of December 31, 2021, a total of 4,178 companies listed securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market, with 1,632 listings on The Nasdaq Global Select Market, 1,169 on The Nasdaq Global Market and 1,377 on The Nasdaq Capital Market.\nWe seek new listings from companies conducting IPOs, including SPACs, and direct listings as well as companies looking to switch from alternative exchanges. In 2021, The Nasdaq Stock Market attracted 1,000 new listings, including 752 IPOs, representing 73% of U.S. IPOs in 2021. Of the 752 IPOs that listed on The Nasdaq Stock Market, 319 were operating companies, representing 76% of all operating company IPOs in 2021 and 71% of SPACs IPOs. Nasdaq featured the year's largest IPO as well as the largest direct listing by first trade volume. The new listings were comprised of the following:\nDuring 2021, we had 33 new listings resulting from companies switching their listings from NYSE or NYSE American to join Nasdaq. Together with companies that transferred additional securities to Nasdaq during 2021, an aggregate of $361 billion in global equity market capitalization switched to Nasdaq. Notable switches in 2021 included Honeywell, Palo Alto Networks and Lucid Group.\nWe also offer listings on the exchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic. For smaller companies and growth companies, we offer access to the financial markets through the Nasdaq First North alternative marketplaces. As of December 31, 2021, a total of 1,235 companies listed securities on our Nordic and Baltic exchanges.\nOur European listing customers include companies, funds and governments. Customers issue securities in the form of cash equities, depository receipts, warrants, ETPs, convertibles, rights, options, bonds or fixed-income related products. In 2021, a total of 207 new companies listed on our Nordic and Baltic exchanges. In addition, 12 companies upgraded their listings from Nasdaq First North to Nasdaq Main Market.\nDuring 2021, we announced a joint venture with several financial institutions to establish an institutional-grade, centralized secondary trading venue for issuers, brokers, shareholders and prospective investors of private company stock. We contributed our Nasdaq Private Market platform to this new, standalone, independent company, of which we own the largest minority interest. Nasdaq Private Market’s existing technology, client relationships and regulatory infrastructure will provide the foundation for the joint venture to develop a full suite of liquidity solutions for private companies. Private companies, brokers and investors\nwill be able to access, connect, manage and execute their private company stock transactions through a global marketplace and customized technology solutions. The platform will continue to manage and support private company stock transactions including tender offers, buy-side book-building, auctions, investor block trades, company directed windows of liquidity and pre-direct listing continuous trading. In addition, the platform will provide end-to-end settlement process management and an inter-broker global marketplace through its existing ATS for all customers, from employees to institutions, to access and transact\n.\nWe are continuing to grow our U.S. Corporate Bond exchange for the listing of corporate bonds. This exchange operates pursuant to The Nasdaq Stock Market exchange license and is powered by the NFF. Surveillance is conducted by the Nasdaq regulatory team, assisted by our Nasdaq Trade Surveillance solution. As of December 31, 2021, 107 corporate bonds were listed on the Corporate Bond exchange. Our U.S. corporate bond listing offering won 23 new issues and we added five existing bond listings that transferred from the NYSE.\nIR & ESG Services\nOur IR & ESG Services business serves both public and private companies and organizations. Our public company clients can be companies listed on our exchanges or other U.S. and global exchanges. We help organizations enhance their ability to understand and expand their global shareholder base, improve corporate governance, and navigate the evolving ESG landscape through our suite of advanced technology, analytics, and consultative services. We also provide clients with counsel on a range of governance and sustainability-related issues.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we provided IR & ESG Services offerings in the following key areas:\n•\nInvestor Relations Intelligence\n. We offer a global team of consultative experts that deliver advisory services including Equity Surveillance & Shareholder Analysis, Investor Engagement and Perception Studies, as well as an industry-leading platform, Nasdaq IR Insight®, to investor relations professionals and executive teams. These solutions allow investor relations officers and executives to better manage their investor relations programs, understand their investor base, target new investors, manage meetings and consume key data such as investor profiles, equity research, consensus estimates and news.\n•\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Solutions\n. Our ESG Advisory practice helps companies analyze, assess and action best practices to attract long-term capital.\nOneReport, a SaaS solution, helps organizations to navigate corporate responsibility frameworks, manage information capture and response process, and deliver ESG data to ratings agencies and other stakeholders.\n5\nWe also provide a global technology offering and consultative services that streamline the meeting process for board of directors and executive leadership teams and help them accelerate decision making and strengthen governance. Our solutions protect sensitive data and facilitate productive collaboration, which enables board members and teams to work faster and more effectively. In December 2021, we enhanced our position as a provider of governance technology and consultative solutions with the acquisition of QDiligence, a provider of software that facilitates digital director and officer questionnaires and self-evaluations for boards of directors and corporate secretaries.\nMarket Services\nOur Market Services segment includes our Equity Derivative Trading and Clearing, Cash Equity Trading, FICC and Trade Management Services businesses.\nEquity Derivative Trading and Clearing\nWe operate six options exchanges in the U.S.: Nasdaq PHLX, The Nasdaq Options Market, Nasdaq BX Options, Nasdaq ISE, Nasdaq GEMX and Nasdaq MRX. These exchanges facilitate the trading of equity, ETF, index and foreign currency options. Together, our combined options market share in 2021 represented the largest share of the U.S. market for all categories, including single-exchange-listed options products. Our options trading platforms provide trading opportunities to both retail investors, algorithmic trading firms and market makers, who tend to prefer electronic trading, and institutional investors, who typically require high touch services to execute their trades, which are often performed on our trading floor in Philadelphia.\nIn Europe, Nasdaq offers trading in derivatives, such as stock options and futures and index options and futures. Nasdaq Clearing offers central counterparty clearing services for stock options and futures and index options and futures.\nCash Equity Trading\nIn the U.S., we operate three cash equity exchanges: The Nasdaq Stock Market, Nasdaq BX and Nasdaq PSX. Our U.S. cash equity exchanges offer trading of both Nasdaq-listed and non-Nasdaq-listed securities. The Nasdaq Stock Market is the largest single venue of liquidity for trading U.S.-listed cash equities. Market participants include market makers, broker-dealers, ATSs, institutional investors, and registered securities exchanges.\nIn Canada, we operate an exchange with three independent markets, Nasdaq Canada CXC, Nasdaq Canada CX2 and Nasdaq Canada CXD,\nfor the trading of Canadian-listed securities.\nIn Europe, Nasdaq operates exchanges in Stockholm (Sweden), Copenhagen (Denmark), Helsinki (Finland), and Reykjavik (Iceland) as well as the clearing operations of Nasdaq Clearing, as Nasdaq Nordic. We also operate exchanges in Tallinn (Estonia), Riga (Latvia) and Vilnius (Lithuania) as Nasdaq Baltic.\nCollectively, the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges offer trading in cash equities, depository receipts, warrants, convertibles, rights, fund units and ETFs, as well as trading and clearing of derivatives and clearing of resale and repurchase agreements. Our platform allows the exchanges to share the same trading system, which enables efficient cross-border trading and settlement, cross membership and a single source for Nordic data products. Settlement and registration of cash equity trading takes place in Sweden, Finland, and Denmark via the local central securities depositories. In addition, Nasdaq owns a central securities depository that provides notary, settlement, central maintenance and other services in the Baltic countries and Iceland.\nFICC\nOur FICC business includes Nasdaq Fixed Income, or NFI, offering trading and clearing services for fixed income products in Europe and Nasdaq Commodities.\nNFI provides a wide range of products and services, such as trading and clearing, for fixed income products in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Estonia, Lithuania and Latvia. Nasdaq is the largest bond listing venue in the Nordics, with more than 5,600 listed retail and institutional bonds. In addition, Nasdaq Nordic facilitates the trading and clearing of Nordic fixed income derivatives in a unique market structure. Buyers and sellers agree to trades in fixed income derivatives through bilateral negotiations and then report those trades to Nasdaq Clearing. Nasdaq Clearing offers central counterparty clearing services for fixed-income options and futures and interest rate swaps. Nasdaq Clearing also operates a clearing service for the resale and repurchase agreement market.\nNasdaq Commodities is the brand name for Nasdaq’s European commodity-related products and services. Nasdaq Commodities’ offerings include derivatives in power, natural gas and carbon emission markets, seafood, electricity certificates and clearing services. These products are listed on Nasdaq Oslo ASA, except for seafood, which is listed on Fishpool, a third party platform.\nNasdaq Oslo ASA is the commodity derivatives exchange for European products. All trades with Nasdaq Oslo ASA are subject to clearing with Nasdaq Clearing, which offers central counterparty clearing services for commodities options and futures.\nIn June 2021, we sold our U.S. Fixed Income business, which included an electronic platform for the trading of U.S. Treasuries.\nAdditionally, in June 2021, we completed the acquisition of a majority stake in Puro.earth, a Finnish-based leading marketplace for carbon removal. Puro.earth offers industrial carbon removal instruments that are verifiable and tradable through an open, online platform. The addition of Puro.earth’s marketplace capabilities to our suite of ESG-focused technologies and workflow solutions gives our clients further resources to successfully achieve their ESG objectives.\n6\nTrade Management Services\nWe provide market participants with a wide variety of alternatives for connecting to and accessing our markets for a fee. Our marketplaces may be accessed via a number of different protocols used for quoting, order entry, trade reporting and connectivity to various data feeds. In April 2021, we launched WorkX, an upgraded version of Nasdaq Workstation, a browser-based, front-end interface that allows market participants to view data and enter orders, quotes and trade reports. WorkX enables a seamless workflow and enhanced trade intelligence. All current Workstation users are expected to migrate to WorkX by the end of 2022. In addition, we offer a variety of add-on compliance tools to help firms comply with regulatory requirements.\nWe provide colocation services to market participants, whereby we offer firms cabinet space and power to house their own equipment and servers within our data centers. Additionally, we offer a number of wireless connectivity offerings between select data centers using millimeter wave and microwave technology.\nOur broker services operations business primarily offers technology and customized securities administration solutions to financial participants in the Nordic market. Such services and solutions primarily consist of flexible back-office systems, which allow customers to efficiently manage safekeeping, settlement and corporate actions and reporting, and include connectivity to exchanges and central securities depositories. In January 2020, we commenced an orderly wind-down of this broker services business. We expect this wind-down to continue through the second quarter of 2022.\nTechnology\nTechnology plays a key role in ensuring the growth, reliability and regulation of financial markets. We have established a technology risk program to evaluate the resiliency of critical systems, including risks associated with cybersecurity. This program is focused on identifying areas for improvement in systems, and implementing changes and upgrades to technology and processes to minimize future risk. We have continued our focus on improving the security of our technology with an emphasis on employee awareness through training, targeted phishing campaigns, and new tool deployment for our securities operations team. See “Item 1A. Risk Factors,” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K for further discussion.\nCore Technology.\nThe NFF is Nasdaq’s approach to delivering end-to-end solutions to market infrastructure operators, buy-side firms, sell-side firms and other non-financial markets in addition to also supporting Nasdaq's own internal trading systems. The framework consists of a single operational core platform that ties together Nasdaq’s portfolio of functionality across the trade lifecycle, in an open framework whereby exchanges, clearinghouses, central securities depositories, and other entities can easily integrate Nasdaq’s business applications with each other, as well as other third-party solutions. In addition to being able to integrate a broad range of business functions, the NFF\nenables end users to leverage recent technology developments.\nCompetitive Strengths\nWe are a global technology company and we continue to diversify our product and service offerings by having a client-first focus and orientation; unparalleled expertise in markets; a trusted, independent, global brand; unique technology capabilities and reputation; and fostering a leading issuer community and investor intelligence platform. Our business segments complement each other.\nWe believe that our strong competitive position in large, high-growth markets positions us for sustained growth.\nA Unique Value Proposition\nWe operate a diverse and resilient capital markets franchise with a marketplace core. Our businesses provide capital-markets infrastructure services to industry players, allowing us to:\n•\nDevelop efficient and reliable technologies to facilitate capital markets activity;\n•\nManage the complexities and costs of business on a global scale; and\n•\nProvide data, tools and insights that drive sound decision making.\nTechnological Strength\nThe strength and resiliency of our technology, enhanced by our Market Technology business, in meeting the advancing demands of our global customer base is vital to the continued success of our business and distinguishes us from our competitors.\nA Focus on Client Needs Throughout the Marketplace\nWe strive to serve a diverse range of clients including:\n•\nBrokers and Traders\n- Helping brokers and traders to confidently plan, optimize and execute their business vision.\n•\nMarket Participants\n- Enabling market participants to monitor and capitalize on real-time market changes.\n7\n•\nInvestors and Asset Managers\n- Offering products and services to assist investors and asset managers in optimizing their portfolios and offerings.\n•\nListed Companies\n- Promoting the capital health of our listed companies.\n•\nMarket Infrastructure Players\n- Assisting market infrastructure players (exchanges, regulators, clearinghouses, and central securities depositories) in increasing efficiency, meeting customer needs and growing revenue.\n•\nCapital Markets\n- Delivering efficiencies through economies of scale (cost, speed, connectivity) to all members of the capital-markets ecosystem.\n•\nBanks and Financial Institutions\n- Providing a suite of trade surveillance and anti-financial crime management solutions.\nCompetition\nMarket Technology\nTraditionally, exchanges and exchange-related businesses would internally develop technology, sometimes aided by consultants. However, over time this model has changed as many operators have recognized the cost-savings made possible by buying technology from third parties. As a result, two types of competitors have emerged in our Market Technology segment: exchange operators and technology providers unaffiliated with exchanges. These organizations make available a range of off-the-shelf technology, including trading, clearing, market surveillance, settlement, depository and information dissemination, and offer customization and operation expertise. Market conditions in Market Technology are evolving rapidly, which makes continuous investment and innovation a necessity. Our partnership with AWS to migrate our exchanges, in a phased approach, to the cloud enables us to compete with other companies that are developing cloud-based exchanges and market technology offerings.\nA wide range of providers compete with us in surveillance, where standardization of products and budget pressures drive customers to focus on pricing. Our competitors range from large enterprise software providers that cover the broader compliance lifecycle to smaller vendors focusing on a single silo of the compliance workflow. Recently, an influx of start-ups have entered the space from the FinTech landscape, often shifting from data and analytics, or a complementary silo like electronic communications, to surveillance. For our anti-financial crime offering, competitors include core banking solution providers, independent fraud and anti-money laundering solution providers and FinTech start-ups. We also compete against enterprise solution providers and point solutions for clients with larger AUM. The anti-financial crime offering competes on a number of factors, including but not limited to, increased workflow efficiency, quality of the data output and pricing.\nOur surveillance and anti-financial crime offerings must demonstrate the ability to decrease false-positives, provide in-depth views into potential abuses and risks that stem from those cases and help firms reduce both the reputational and regulatory risk, and complexity in efforts to keep markets and financial institutions safe.\nInvestment Intelligence\nOur Market Data business in the U.S. includes both proprietary and consolidated data products. Proprietary data products are made up exclusively of data derived from each exchange’s systems. Consolidated data products are distributed by SEC-mandated consolidators (one for Nasdaq-listed stocks and another for NYSE and other-listed stocks) that share the revenue among the exchanges that contribute data. In Europe, all data products are proprietary, as there is no official data consolidator. Competition in the data business is intense and is influenced by rapidly changing technology and the creation of new product and service offerings.\nThe sale of our proprietary data products is under competitive threat globally from alternative exchanges and trading venues that offer similar products. Our data business competes with other exchanges and third party vendors to provide information to market participants. Examples of our competitors in proprietary data products are ICE, Cboe, TSX, and Dow Jones & Company.\nThe consolidated data business is under competitive pressure from other securities exchanges that trade Nasdaq-listed securities. In addition, The Nasdaq Stock Market similarly competes for the tape fees from the sale of information on securities listed on other markets.\nOur Index business faces competition from providers of various competing financial indexes. For example, there are a number of indexes that aim to track the technology sector and thereby compete with the Nasdaq-100 Index and the Nasdaq Composite Index. We face competition from investment banks, dedicated index providers, markets and other product developers, including S&P Dow Jones Indices, MSCI and FTSE Russell.\nOur Analytics business faces competition from a broad array of data and analytics suppliers, both established firms and small start-ups. Our primary competitors are Morningstar, FactSet and any number of smaller firms along with start-up data providers and aggregators. Our Solovis offering competes with other analytics providers, including Addepar and Caissa. Additionally, other large providers to the financial services industry, such as Bloomberg and Refinitiv, are believed to be interested in pursuing certain aspects of the services we provide.\n8\nCorporate Platforms\nOur Listing Services business in both the U.S. and Europe provides a means of facilitating capital formation through public capital markets. There are competing ways of raising capital, and we seek to demonstrate the benefits of listing shares on our exchange. Our primary competitor for larger company stock share listings in the U.S. is NYSE. The Nasdaq Stock Market competes with local and international markets located outside the U.S. for listings of equity securities of both U.S. and non-U.S. companies that choose to list (or dual-list) outside of their home country. For example, The Nasdaq Stock Market competes for listings with exchanges in Europe and Asia, such as LSE and The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited. Additionally, we face competition from private equity firms that may elect to keep their portfolio companies as private companies.\nThe Listings Services business in Europe is characterized by a large number of exchanges competing for new or secondary listings. Each country has one or more national exchanges, which are often the first choice of companies in each respective country. For those considering an alternative, competing European exchanges that frequently attract many listings from outside their respective home countries include LSE, Euronext N.V. and Deutsche Börse AG. In addition to the larger exchanges, companies seeking capital or liquidity from public capital markets are able to raise capital without a regulated market listing and can consider trading their shares on smaller markets and quoting facilities.\nIn our IR & ESG Services business, competition is varied and can be fragmented. For our Investor Relations Intelligence solutions, there are many regional competitors and relatively few global providers. Other exchange operators are partnering with firms that have capabilities in this area and seeking to acquire relevant assets in order to provide investor relations services to customers alongside listing services. The competitive landscape for our Governance Solutions business varies by customer segment and geography. Most competitors offer SaaS solutions that are supported by a data centered strategy. Some firms offer specialized services that focus on a single niche segment. The larger players often offer additional services. Customers frequently seek single-source providers that are able to address a broad range of needs within a single platform. Our ESG-focused services, including Nasdaq OneReport and ESG Advisory, are positioned in evolving markets with competitors offering multiple point solutions providing software, data or consulting services.\nMarket Services\nWe face intense competition in North America and Europe in businesses that comprise our Market Services segment. We seek to provide market participants with greater functionality, trading system stability and performance, high levels of customer service, and efficient pricing. In both North America and Europe, our competitors include other exchange operators, operators of non-exchange trading systems and banks and brokerages that operate their own internal trading pools and platforms.\nIn the U.S., our options markets compete with exchanges operated by Cboe Global Markets, Inc., or Cboe, Miami International Holdings, Inc., or MIAX, Intercontinental Exchange, Inc., or ICE, and Boston Options Market. In cash equities in the U.S., we compete with exchanges operated by Cboe, ICE, MIAX, The Investors Exchange, and the recently launched Members Exchange and the Long Term Stock Exchange. We also face competition from ATSs, known as “dark pools,” and other less-heavily regulated broker-owned trade facilitation systems, as well as from other types of OTC trading. In Canada, our cash equities exchange competes with exchanges such as the Toronto Stock Exchange, or TSX, and other marketplaces.\nIn Europe, our cash equities markets compete with exchanges such as Euronext N.V., Deutsche Börse AG and London Stock Exchange Group plc, or LSE, and many MTFs such as Cboe, Turquoise and Aquis. Our competitors in the trading and clearing of options and futures on European equities include Eurex, Cboe, ICE Futures Europe and London Clearing House, or LCH. In addition, in equities in Europe we face competition from other broker-owned systems, dark pools, SIs, and other types of OTC trading. Competition among exchanges for trading European equity derivatives tends to occur where there is competition in the trading of the underlying equities. In addition to exchange-based competition, we face competition from OTC derivative markets.\nThe implementation of MiFID II and MiFIR has resulted in further competitive pressure on our European trading business. SIs are already attracting a significant share of electronically matched volume and we expect such venues to compete aggressively for the trading of equity securities listed on our Nordic exchanges. Different bilateral trading systems pursuing block business also remain active in Europe. As part of this, trading on SIs has increased markedly as volumes migrate from more transparent types of trading venues. Regulators are continuously monitoring the market structure and have, in a series of consultations, asked for input regarding suggested changes to MiFID II.\nOur European fixed income and commodities products\nand services are subject to competitive pressure from European exchanges and clearinghouses.\nOur Trade Management Services business competes with other exchange operators, extranet providers, and data center providers.\nIntellectual Property\nWe believe that our intellectual property assets are important for maintaining the competitive differentiation of our products, systems, software and services, enhancing our ability to access technology of third parties and maximizing our return on research and development investments.\nTo support our business objectives and benefit from our investments in research and development, we actively create and maintain a wide array of intellectual property assets, including patents and patent applications related to our\n9\ninnovations, products and services; trademarks related to our brands, products and services; copyrights in software and creative content; trade secrets; and through other intellectual property rights, licenses of various kinds and contractual provisions. We enter into confidentiality and invention assignment agreements with our employees and contractors, and utilize non-disclosure agreements with third parties with whom we conduct business in order to secure and protect our proprietary rights and to limit access to, and disclosure of, our proprietary information.\nWe own, or have licensed, rights to trade names, trademarks, domain names and service marks that we use in conjunction with our operations and services. We have registered many of our most important trademarks in the U.S. and in foreign countries. For example, our primary “Nasdaq” mark is a registered trademark that we actively seek to protect in the U.S. and in over 50 other countries worldwide.\nOver time, we have accumulated a robust portfolio of issued patents in the U.S. and in many other jurisdictions across the world. We currently hold rights to patents relating to certain aspects of our products, systems, software and services, but we primarily rely on the innovative skills, technical competence and marketing abilities of our personnel. No single patent is in itself core to the operations of Nasdaq or any of its principal business areas.\nCorporate Venture Practice\nWe operate a corporate venture program to make minority investments primarily in emerging growth financial technology companies that are strategically relevant to, and aligned with, Nasdaq. Investments are made through the venture program to further our research and development efforts and accelerate the path to commercial viability. We expect that capital invested will continue to be modest and will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements, existing capital return or deployment priorities. Since its inception in 2017, our venture program has grown, with aggregate initial and follow-on investments of approximately $90 million in 19 companies in various sectors, including data, analytics and workflow, digital assets, market infrastructure, anti-financial crime, new marketplaces, and ESG.\nEnvironmental, Social and Governance Matters\nNasdaq is committed to further advancing our longer-term ESG strategy, advocacy and oversight. We continue to engage with internal and external stakeholders at all levels on ESG matters. During 2021, we deepened our corporate and community ESG efforts, including expanding ESG oversight of our own operations and furthering our commitment to greater sustainability and climate change awareness.\nFor the fourth consecutive year, Nasdaq achieved its continued commitment to be carbon neutral across all business operations through the purchase of green power, carbon removal offsets, and renewable energy certificates. We were named to the Dow Jones Sustainability North America Index for the sixth consecutive year and have seen\npositive progress on our ESG scores across multiple rating agencies. Nasdaq is also a signatory to the United Nations Global Compact and the United Nations Principles of Responsible Investment.\nWhile our business operations account for a comparatively small environmental impact, we are able to focus environmental efforts on several key areas, including the way we use energy resources, manage our workspaces, and conduct business travel. Through these efforts, we seek to lessen the environmental impact of our organization by reducing atmospheric carbon emissions and managing water and waste associated with business operations. Our commitment to implement Science-Based targets as part of the Science-Based Targets Initiative further emphasizes our ambition to drive to a net-zero economy. For the first time, Nasdaq obtained a Platinum LEED certification for our New York Headquarters and we continue to look for opportunities to transition to green offices across the globe.\nWe also expanded our ESG services and solutions with new offerings for our clients, including:\n•\nthe Nasdaq ESG Advisory Program, which pairs companies with consultative ESG expertise to help them analyze, assess and enact ESG program best practices with the goals of attracting long-term capital and enhancing value;\n•\nthe Nasdaq OneReport platform, which helps clients streamline the data gathering process under various frameworks for sustainability reporting and to provide data to ratings agencies;\n•\nthe Nasdaq Sustainable Bond Network, which connects issuers and investors in sustainable, green and social bonds, and provides access to detailed information and impact data allowing investors to make more informed decisions;\n•\nthe Nasdaq ESG Data Hub, which connects investors with expert-led ESG data sets from leading providers across a wide spectrum of areas, including gender diversity, carbon emissions and climate risk, providing detailed and tangible intelligence on companies’ ESG profiles;\n•\nthe Nasdaq ESG Data Portal, which now includes ESG-related data from more than 630 companies;\n•\nthe Nasdaq ESG Footprint, a tool to help both institutional and retail investors understand the impact of their portfolios; and\n•\nthe acquisition of a majority stake in Puro.earth, a leading marketplace for carbon removal, which we believe will address the growing demand for carbon removal by corporations, as well as enable new carbon removal methodologies as technologies evolve.\n10\nIn 2021, we also adopted a new Supplier Code of Ethics, which encourages our suppliers and vendors to adopt\nsustainability and environmental practices in line with our published Environmental Practices Statement. This code asks our suppliers to measure, report, and mitigate any potential negative climate change and biodiversity impacts associated with their operations, products and services including energy and water consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, waste, air and water pollution, nature loss and hazardous materials.\nOur policy asks suppliers to provide us with information to support our reporting and transparency commitments related to environmental sustainability and supply chain emissions.\nAdditionally, the Supplier Code of Ethics expects suppliers to promote a diverse and inclusive workforce and encourages suppliers to engage diverse-owned business in their supply chain.\nOur Supplier Code of Ethics is available on Nasdaq’s website.\nDuring 2021, the SEC adopted Nasdaq’s new listings rule for companies listed on our U.S. exchange to publicly disclose consistent, transparent diversity statistics regarding their board of directors and choose whether to meet recommended board diversity objectives or disclose their reasons for not doing so. The diversity rule is currently being challenged by two advocacy groups in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit.\nNasdaq also was included in the 2021 Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index in recognition for advancing equality across its global workforce, and earned a perfect score for the third consecutive year by the Human Rights Campaign Foundation’s 2021 Corporate Equality Index regarding LGBTQ+ workplace equality.\nFor more information regarding our ESG efforts in 2021, both internally and externally, please see the section entitled “Human Capital Management” below and our Proxy Statement.\nRegulation\nWe are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., Canada and Europe.\nU.S. Regulation\nU.S. federal securities laws establish a system of cooperative regulation of securities markets, market participants and listed companies. SROs conduct the day-to-day administration and regulation of the nation’s securities markets under the close supervision of, and subject to extensive regulation, oversight and enforcement by, the SEC. SROs, such as national securities exchanges, are registered with the SEC.\nThis regulatory framework applies to our U.S. business in the following ways:\n•\nregulation of our registered national securities exchanges; and\n•\nregulation of our U.S. broker-dealer and investment advisor subsidiaries.\nNational Securities Exchanges.\nSROs in the securities industry are an essential component of the regulatory scheme of the Exchange Act for providing fair and orderly markets and protecting investors. The Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, as well as each SRO’s own rules, impose many regulatory and operational responsibilities on SROs, including the day-to-day responsibilities for market and broker-dealer oversight. Moreover, an SRO is responsible for enforcing compliance by its members, and persons associated with its members, with the provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the SRO, including rules and regulations governing the business conduct of its members.\nNasdaq currently operates three cash equity, six options markets and one corporate bond market in the U.S. We operate The Nasdaq Stock Market, The Nasdaq Options Market and the Corporate Bond Market pursuant to The Nasdaq Stock Market’s SRO license; Nasdaq BX and Nasdaq BX Options pursuant to Nasdaq BX’s SRO license; Nasdaq PSX and Nasdaq PHLX pursuant to Nasdaq PHLX’s SRO license; and Nasdaq ISE, Nasdaq GEMX and Nasdaq MRX, each of which operates an options market under its own SRO license. As SROs, each entity has separate rules pertaining\nto its broker-dealer members and listed companies. Broker-dealers that choose to become members of our exchanges are subject to the rules of those exchanges.\nAll of our U.S. national securities exchanges are subject to SEC oversight, as prescribed by the Exchange Act, including periodic and special examinations by the SEC. Our exchanges also are potentially subject to regulatory or legal action by the SEC at any time in connection with alleged regulatory violations. We have been subject to a number of routine reviews and inspections by the SEC or external auditors in the ordinary course, and we have been and may in the future be subject to SEC enforcement proceedings. To the extent such actions or reviews and inspections result in regulatory or other changes, we may be required to modify the manner in which we conduct our business, which may adversely affect our business, operating results and financial condition.\nSection 19 of the Exchange Act provides that our exchanges must submit to the SEC proposed changes to any of the SROs’ rules, practices and procedures, including revisions to provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by-laws that constitute SRO rules. The SEC will typically publish such proposed changes for public comment, after which the SEC may approve or disapprove the proposal, as it deems appropriate. SEC approval requires a finding by the SEC that the proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. Pursuant to the requirements of the Exchange Act, our exchanges must file with the SEC, among other things, all proposals to change their pricing structure.\n11\nNasdaq conducts real-time market monitoring, certain equity surveillance not involving cross-market activity, most options surveillance, rulemaking and membership functions through our Nasdaq Regulation department. We review suspicious trading behavior discovered by our regulatory staff, and depending on the nature of the activity, may refer the activity to FINRA for further investigation. Pursuant to regulatory services agreements between FINRA and our SROs, FINRA provides certain regulatory services to our markets, including some regulation of trading activity and surveillance and investigative functions. Our SROs retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for all regulatory activities performed under regulatory agreements by FINRA, and for fulfilling all regulatory obligations for which FINRA does not have responsibility under the regulatory services agreements.\nIn addition to its other SRO responsibilities, The Nasdaq Stock Market, as a listing market, also is responsible for overseeing each listed company’s compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Market’s financial and corporate governance standards. Our listing qualifications department evaluates applications submitted by issuers interested in listing their securities on The Nasdaq Stock Market to determine whether the quantitative and qualitative listing standards have been satisfied. Once securities are listed, the listing qualifications department monitors each issuer’s on-going compliance with The Nasdaq Stock Market’s continued listing standards.\nBroker-dealer regulation.\nNasdaq’s broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC, the SROs and various state securities regulators. Nasdaq operates three broker-dealers: Nasdaq Execution Services, LLC, NFSTX, LLC, and Nasdaq Capital Markets Advisory LLC. Each broker-dealer is registered with the SEC, a member of FINRA and registered in the U.S. states and territories required by the operation of its business.\nIn addition, we own a minority interest in NPM Securities.\nNasdaq Execution Services operates as our routing broker for sending orders from Nasdaq's U.S. cash equity and options exchanges to other venues for execution. NFSTX is a registered ATS and acts as an intermediary to facilitate secondary transactions in certain funds (both registered or not registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940), business development companies, certain closed-end funds and private real estate investment funds. Nasdaq Capital Markets Advisory acts as a third-party advisor to privately-held or publicly-traded companies during IPOs and various other offerings.\nThe SEC, FINRA and the exchanges adopt rules and examine broker-dealers and require strict compliance with their rules and regulations. The SEC, SROs and state securities commissions may conduct administrative proceedings which can result in censures, fines, the issuance of cease-and-desist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a broker-dealer, its officers or employees. The SEC and state regulators may also institute proceedings against broker-dealers seeking an injunction or other sanction. All broker-dealers have an SRO that is assigned by the SEC as the broker-dealer’s Designated\nExamining Authority. The Designated Examining Authority is responsible for examining a broker-dealer for compliance with the SEC’s financial responsibility rules. FINRA is the current Designated Examining Authority for each of our broker-dealer subsidiaries.\nOur registered broker-dealers are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, each of our broker-dealers were in compliance with all of the applicable capital requirements.\nRegulatory contractual relationships with FINRA\n.\nOur SROs have signed a series of regulatory service agreements covering the services FINRA provides to the respective SROs. Under these agreements, FINRA personnel act as our agents in performing the regulatory functions outlined above, and FINRA bills us a fee for these services. These agreements have enabled us to reduce our headcount while ensuring that the markets for which we are responsible are properly regulated. However, we have reduced the scope of services provided by FINRA under these regulatory services agreements and are performing certain of those regulatory functions directly. In addition, our SROs retain ultimate regulatory responsibility for all regulatory activities performed under these agreements by FINRA.\nExchange Act Rule 17d-2 permits SROs to enter into agreements, commonly called Rule 17d-2 agreements, approved by the SEC with respect to enforcement of common rules relating to common members. Our SROs have entered into several such agreements under which FINRA assumes regulatory responsibility for specifics covered by the agreement, including:\n•\nagreements with FINRA covering the enforcement of common rules, the majority of which relate to the regulation of common members of our SROs and FINRA;\n•\njoint industry agreements with FINRA covering responsibility for enforcement of insider trading rules;\n•\njoint industry agreement with FINRA covering enforcement of rules related to cash equity sales practices and certain other non-market related rules; and\n•\njoint industry agreement covering enforcement of rules related to options sales practices.\nRegulation NMS and Options Intermarket Linkage Plan.\nWe are subject to Regulation NMS for our cash equity markets, and our options markets have joined the Options Intermarket Linkage Plan. These are designed to facilitate the routing of orders among exchanges to create a national market system as mandated by the Exchange Act. One of the principal purposes of a national market system is to assure that brokers may execute investors’ orders at the best market price. Both Regulation NMS and the Options Intermarket Linkage Plan require that exchanges avoid trade-throughs, locking or crossing of markets and provide market participants with electronic access to the best prices among the markets for the applicable cash equity or options order.\n12\nIn addition, Regulation NMS requires that every national securities exchange on which an NMS stock is traded and every national securities association act jointly pursuant to one or more national market system plans to disseminate consolidated information, including a national best bid and national best offer, on quotations for transactions in NMS stocks, and that such plan or plans provide for the dissemination of all consolidated information for an individual NMS stock through a single plan processor.\nThe UTP Plan was filed with and approved by the SEC as a national market system plan in accordance with the Exchange Act and Regulation NMS to provide for the collection,\nconsolidation and dissemination of such information for Nasdaq-listed securities. The Nasdaq Stock Market serves as the processor for the UTP Plan pursuant to a contract that was recently extended for a two-year term through October 2023. The Nasdaq Stock Market also serves as the administrator for the UTP Plan. To fulfill its obligations as the processor, The Nasdaq Stock Market has designed, implemented, maintained, and operated a data processing and communications system, hardware, software and communications infrastructure to provide processing for the UTP Plan. As the administrator, The Nasdaq Stock Market manages the distribution of market data, the collection of the resulting market data revenue, and the dissemination of that revenue to plan members in accordance with the terms of the UTP Plan and of Regulation NMS.\nIn May 2020, the SEC adopted an order to require changes to the governance of securities information processors. In June 2020, we and several other exchanges petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, or the Court of Appeals, to review the SEC’s governance order. In June 2021, the Court of Appeals dismissed our petition as premature, but gave us leave to challenge the governance order after the SEC acted pursuant to the order to approve a national market system plan implementing it.\nAccordingly, we refiled our challenge in August 2021, and also asked the Court of Appeals to stay the operation of the new national market system plan.\nIn October 2021, the Court of Appeals granted our stay request. This case is scheduled for oral argument on March 24, 2022.\nIn December 2020, the SEC adopted a rule to modify the infrastructure for the collection, consolidation and dissemination of market data for exchange-listed national market stocks, or NMS data. The rule changes include, among other things, requiring exchanges to add more “core data” to the securities information processors, including partial depth-of-book, certain odd-lot quotations/transactions, auction, regulatory, and administrative data; eliminating central, official consolidators of tape plans and enabling multiple competing consolidators to register to aggregate and disseminate core data; and authorizing persons to purchase and aggregate core data directly from the exchanges for their own use. The rule implementation schedule has not yet been finalized by the SEC, and we are not certain of the timing, or the impact, of these new rules on our business or role as a\nsecurities information processor. In February 2021, we petitioned the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit to review the SEC’s rulemaking. This case is scheduled for oral argument on March 18, 2022.\nRegulation SCI.\nRegulation SCI is a set of rules designed to strengthen the technology infrastructure of the U.S. securities markets. Regulation SCI applies to national securities exchanges, operators of certain ATSs, market data information providers and clearing agencies, subjecting these entities to extensive new compliance obligations, with the goals of reducing the occurrence of technical issues that disrupt the securities markets and improving recovery time when disruptions occur.\nWe implemented an inter-disciplinary program to ensure compliance with Regulation SCI. Regulation SCI policies and procedures were created, internal policies and procedures were updated, and an information technology governance program was developed to ensure compliance.\nRegulation of Registered Investment Advisor Subsidiary.\nOur subsidiary NDW is an investment advisor registered with the SEC under the Investment Advisors Act of 1940. In this capacity, NDW is subject to oversight and inspections by the SEC. Among other things, registered investment advisors like NDW must comply with certain disclosure obligations, advertising and fee restrictions and requirements relating to client suitability and custody of funds and securities. Registered investment advisors are also subject to anti-fraud provisions under both federal and state law.\nCFTC Regulation.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act also has resulted in increased CFTC regulation of our use of certain regulated derivatives products, as well as the operations of some of our subsidiaries outside the U.S. and their customers.\nCanadian Regulation\nRegulation of Nasdaq Canada is performed by the Canadian Securities Administrators, an umbrella organization of Canada’s provincial and territorial securities regulators. As a recognized exchange in Ontario, Nasdaq Canada must comply with the terms and conditions of its exchange recognition order. While exempt from exchange recognition in each jurisdiction in Canada other than Ontario where Nasdaq Canada carries on business, Nasdaq must also comply with the terms and conditions of an exemption order granted by the other jurisdictions in order to maintain its exemptive status. Oversight of the exchange is performed by Nasdaq Canada’s lead regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission.\nNasdaq Canada is subject to several national marketplace related instruments which set out requirements for marketplace operations, trading rules and managing electronic trading risk. Exchange terms and conditions include but are not limited to, requirements for governance, regulation, rules and rulemaking, fair access, conflict management and financial viability.\n13\nEuropean Regulation\nRegulation of our markets in the European Union and the European Economic Area focuses on matters relating to financial services, listing and trading of securities, clearing and settlement of securities and commodities as well as issues related to market abuse.\nIn July 2016, the European Union’s Market Abuse Regulation, which is intended to prevent market abuse, entered into force. MiFID II and MiFIR entered into force in January 2018 and primarily affect our European trading businesses. Many of the provisions of MiFID II and MiFIR are implemented through technical standards drafted by the European Securities and Markets Authority and approved by the European Commission. In addition, in 2016, the European Union adopted legislation on governance and control of the production and use of benchmark indexes. The Benchmark Regulation applies in the European Union from early 2018. However, due to transitional clauses in the Benchmark Regulation, Nasdaq as a benchmark provider, did not need to be in compliance with the Benchmark Regulation until January 1, 2020 in relation to benchmarks provided by Nasdaq’s European subsidiaries, or until January 1, 2024, in relation to benchmarks provided by non-European Nasdaq entities. As the regulatory environment continues to evolve and related opportunities arise, we intend to continue developing our products and services to ensure that the exchanges and clearinghouse that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic maintain favorable liquidity and offer fair and efficient trading.\nThe entities that operate trading venues in the Nordic and Baltic countries are each subject to local regulations. As a result, we have a strong local presence in each jurisdiction in which we operate regulated businesses. The regulated entities have decision-making power and can adopt policies and procedures and retain resources to manage all operations subject to their license. In Sweden, general supervision of the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange is carried out by the SFSA, while Nasdaq Clearing’s role as CCP in the clearing of derivatives is supervised by the SFSA and overseen by the Swedish central bank (Riksbanken). Additionally, as a function of the Swedish two-tier supervisory model, certain surveillance in relation to the exchange market is carried out by the Nasdaq Stockholm exchange, through its surveillance function.\nNasdaq Stockholm’s exchange activities are regulated primarily by the SSMA, which implements MiFID II into Swedish law and which sets up basic requirements regarding the board of the exchange and its share capital, and which also outlines the conditions on which exchange licenses are issued. The SSMA also provides that any changes to the exchange’s articles of association following initial registration must be approved by the SFSA. Nasdaq Clearing holds the license as a CCP under EMIR.\nWith respect to ongoing operations, the SSMA requires exchanges to conduct their activities in an honest, fair and professional manner, and in such a way as to maintain public\nconfidence in the securities markets. When operating a regulated market, an exchange must apply the principles of free access (i.e., that each person which meets the requirements established by law and by the exchange may participate in trading), neutrality (i.e., that the exchange’s rules for the regulated market are applied in a consistent manner to all those who participate in trading) and transparency (i.e., that the participants must be given speedy, simultaneous and correct information concerning trading and that the general public must be given the opportunity to access this information). Additionally, the exchange operator must identify and manage the risks that may arise in its operations, use secure technical systems and identify and handle the conflicts of interest that may arise between the exchange or its owners’ interests and the interest in safeguarding effective risk management and secure technical systems. Similar requirements are set up by EMIR in relation to clearing operations.\nThe SSMA also contains the framework for both the SFSA’s supervisory work in relation to exchanges and clearinghouses and the surveillance to be carried out by the exchanges themselves. The latter includes the requirement that an exchange should have “an independent surveillance function with sufficient resources and powers to meet the exchange’s obligations.” That requires the exchange to, among other things, supervise trading and price information, compliance with laws, regulations and good market practice, participant compliance with trading participation rules, financial instrument compliance with relevant listing rules and the extent to which issuers meet their obligation to submit regular financial information to relevant authorities.\nThe regulatory environment in the other Nordic and Baltic countries in which a Nasdaq entity has a trading venue is broadly similar to the regulatory environment in Sweden. Since 2005, there has been cooperation between the supervisory authorities in Sweden, Iceland, Denmark and Finland, which looks to safeguard effective and comprehensive supervision of the exchanges comprising Nasdaq Nordic and the systems operated by it, and to ensure a common supervisory approach. In 2019, the supervisory authority in Norway joined this cooperation.\nNasdaq owns a central securities depository known as Nasdaq CSD SE (Societas Europaea)¸ that provides notary, settlement, central maintenance and other services in the Baltic countries and in Iceland. Nasdaq CSD SE is licensed under the European Central Securities Depositories Regulation and is supervised by the respective regulatory institutions.\nWe operate a licensed exchange, Nasdaq Oslo ASA, in Norway that trades and lists commodity derivatives. Although Norway is not a member of the EU, as a result of the European Economic Area, or EEA, agreement (agreement on the EEA entered into between the EU and European Free Trade Association) the regulatory environment is broadly similar to what applies in EU member states. In addition, in January 2019 new legislation entered into force in Norway\n14\nmirroring the provisions of MiFID II and MIFIR. As a result, the regulatory environment in Norway is similar to Sweden. The Financial Supervisory Authority of Norway supervises the Norwegian exchange on an autonomous basis and the Norwegian exchange also has a separate market surveillance function overseen by the Financial Supervisory Authority.\nConfidence in capital markets is paramount for trading to function properly. Nasdaq Nordic carries out market surveillance through an independent unit that is separate from the business operations. The surveillance work is conceptually organized into two functions: one for the review and admission of listing applications and surveillance activities related to issuers (issuer surveillance) and one for surveillance of trading (trading surveillance). The real-time trading surveillance for the Finnish, Icelandic, Danish and Swedish markets has been centralized to Stockholm. In addition, there are special personnel who carry out surveillance activities at Nasdaq Oslo and the three Baltic exchanges. In Finland, Sweden and Estonia, decisions to list new companies on the main market are made by listing committees that have external members in addition to members from each respective exchange and in the other countries the decision is made either by the respective president of the exchange or by the executive board.\nIf there is suspicion that a listed company or member has acted in breach of exchange regulations, the matter is handled by the respective surveillance department. Serious breaches are considered by the respective disciplinary committee in Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Sweden and Norway. Suspected insider trading is reported to the appropriate authorities in the respective country.\nIn the United Kingdom, The Nasdaq Stock Market, Nasdaq Oslo ASA, Nasdaq Stockholm AB, Nasdaq Copenhagen A/S, and Nasdaq Helsinki Ltd are each subject to regulation by the Financial Conduct Authority as “Recognised Overseas Investment Exchanges.” Nasdaq Clearing is registered as a recognized third country CCP with the Bank of England under the temporary recognition regime. The registration became effective on December 31, 2020, and lasts for three years. We will be applying for permanent recognition within eighteen months of the end of this implementation period.\nHuman Capital Management\nNasdaq deepened its commitment to, and investment in, attracting, retaining, developing and motivating its employees during 2021, and while the COVID-19 pandemic has continued to create certain challenges for our employees, we have bolstered our human capital management efforts throughout the past year. The cultural foundation at Nasdaq is based on our core values: Act as an Owner, Play as a Team, Fuel Client Success, Lead with Integrity, Expand Your Expertise, and Drive Innovation. We believe these cultural values energize and align employees with our most important priorities, and encourage and reward high levels of performance, innovation and growth, while not promoting undue risk.\nDuring 2021, we continued to bolster our efforts to create a diverse and inclusive work environment of equal opportunity, where employees feel respected and valued for their contributions, and where Nasdaq and its employees have opportunities to make positive contributions to our local communities.\nNasdaq held its first annual Purpose Week in 2021, a week-long internal series showcasing Nasdaq’s inclusive growth initiatives and leveraging Nasdaq’s unique position at the center of capital markets.\nThe week featured online events, volunteer activities, expert discussions and business innovation challenges for the entire global Nasdaq workforce.\nAs of December 31, 2021, Nasdaq had 5,814 full and part-time employees. Our total headcount includes 776 employees from Verafin, which we acquired in February 2021.\nESG Oversight\nThe Nominating & ESG Committee has formal responsibility and oversight for ESG policies and programs and receives regular reporting on key ESG matters and initiatives. Our Corporate ESG Steering Committee serves as the central coordinating body for our ESG strategy; it is co-chaired by executive leaders and comprised of geographically diverse representatives from multiple business units.\nCOVID-19 and Employee Safety\nAs the COVID-19 pandemic continues around the world, affecting all of our offices, we are committed to ensuring the safety and well-being of our employees and stakeholders, and complying with local government regulations in the areas in which we operate. This includes having the vast majority of our employees work from home, while implementing additional safety measures and precautions for employees continuing critical on-site work in certain of our offices or returning to the office. We currently expect to transition to a hybrid work environment during 2022 as we reopen our global offices and will continue to evaluate local conditions and regulations\nWe also continued benefits for our employees that were introduced in 2020 as a result of COVID-19, and introduced additional new benefits this year in an effort to help our employees balance their work and personal commitments. These benefits include providing “flex days” for additional time away from the office without requiring the usage of vacation or personal leave days, additional family care resources and benefits, including back-up childcare and other caregiver support, subsidized distance-learning enrichment programs and free home workout programs through different wellness and fitness providers.\nWe also added new programs to help employees coordinate care for chronically ill family members and to support employees whose family experienced the death of a loved one.\nOur managers participated in additional training programs to help them lead their teams through COVID-19 concerns and challenges.\n15\nTalent Management and Development\nWe continued to increase our efforts in attracting and retaining our employees.\nNasdaq seeks to hire world-class, innovative, and diverse talent across the globe.\nWe created a Talent Attraction Team focused on strategic marketing and branding to position Nasdaq as a top employer of choice for talent in our industry, helping to increase our pool of top candidates for open positions, particularly diverse candidates.\nWe continued to strengthen our\ndiversity recruiting efforts to help us attract talent using innovative new techniques and channels, enabling us to successfully launch partnerships with diverse talent organizations, such as the National Society of Black Engineers, the Society of Women Engineers, Women in Technology, Grace Hopper and the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers, improving brand awareness of Nasdaq and helping us to attract more diverse candidates in our recruiting campaigns.\nDuring 2021, we launched a year-long campaign called “Your Career Journey” to engage employees and managers in sustained professional development, and established a core curriculum to customize curated development training for employees at each level of seniority.\nWe created performance objectives for each our managers measuring them on managerial effectiveness, and the outcomes were included in each manager’s year-end performance evaluation. We further refined our onboarding and exit surveys to better understand why employees join, and leave, Nasdaq.\nOur internal employee engagement score, based on our biannual employee engagement surveys, increased year-over-year from 2020. Additionally, our peer-to-peer employee recognition program rewards employees and highlights recognized employees on our internal social media channels, further amplifying the recognition. Our workforce voluntary attrition rate during 2021 was 11.5%. This voluntary attrition rate is lower than averages in the financial services and technology sectors, as well as for all industries, based on a study for the U.S. for the period June 1, 2020 to June 1, 2021.\nOur internship program welcomed 157 interns remotely to Nasdaq, and 64% of graduating interns were converted into full-time hires.\nWe have invested in professional development for our employees, including offering access to more than 18,000 professional development programs; providing tuition assistance to employees enrolled in degree-granting academic programs; holding internal career fairs and career development programs; establishing formal mentoring programs and providing one-on-one professional coaching opportunities.\nWe also launched a new internal platform, the Talent Marketplace, to enable our employees to find short-term on-the-job development “gigs” throughout the company, as well as search for and apply for internal full-time job opportunities.\nThis program provides greater exposure and professional development for our employees to learn about different organizations in the company and expand their professional network at Nasdaq, which we believe is a highly effective employee retention technique.\nFinally, to reward our employees at various stages of their tenure with Nasdaq, we introduced a new anniversary recognition program that includes, depending on the work anniversary, Nasdaq-branded merchandise, charitable donations in the name of an employee, personalized messages from our Chief Executive Officer and recognition on our Nasdaq Tower in New York City.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nWe have established three pillars to guide our diversity, equity and inclusion efforts with our employees:\nWorkforce\n, to ensure our employee population is representative of the communities in which we operate;\nWorkplace\n, to ensure a positive, equitable workplace experience for all employees of Nasdaq; and\nMarketplace\n, to positively influence our peers in the capital market space and to invest in our local communities in which we operate.\nNasdaq sponsors eleven employee-led internal affinity networks. These networks include more than 1,900 employee members, representing 39% of our employees, to support the diverse communities that comprise our workforce, including networks for our Black, Asian American, Hispanic, LGBTQ+, female, disabled, veteran, and parent/caregiver employees and those that support these employees. The networks provide both formal and informal development programs and guidance for their members, and benefit the entire Nasdaq workforce through educational events, guest speakers, and volunteering opportunities.\nIn order to monitor our diversity efforts on an ongoing basis, each business unit has a dashboard reflecting the diversity of their employee population and leaders can track diverse representation on a monthly basis, including hires, departures, and employee sentiment.\nDuring 2021, more than 80% of our global managers, and 100% of our executive team, participated in a “conscious inclusion” leadership development program that offered training and increased awareness on inclusion issues.\nWe also added customized developmental programs for underrepresented talent, including executive mentoring and accelerated leadership development programs. In 2021, we launched a high-potential leadership program for our Black employees to hone their skills and increase advancement opportunities; 50% of participants in this program were promoted in 2021, while 100% of participants have remained with Nasdaq to date. During our annual executive succession planning exercise with our Board of Directors, we achieved a 34% increase in the diversity of our succession candidates (considering gender, race and LGBTQ+ status) due to a focus by our senior executives on identifying and cultivating talent deeper in their organizations. Additionally, as a signatory to the Parity Pledge, we fulfilled our commitment to interview female candidates for all externally advertised roles at the Vice President level and above.\n16\nWorkplace Demographics\nDuring 2021, we continued our progress to increase the diversity of our global workforce.\nOur global employee base of women grew from 35% to 36%, and in the United States, we increased our under-represented minority representation from 15% to 16%. In the United States, Nasdaq has increased representation of under-represented minorities by approximately 10% since 2019.\nGender and Ethnicity Performance Data as of December 31, 2021 and 2020\nGender\n:\n* In the charts above, totals may not add up to 100% due to rounding and the omission of race and ethnicities that are less than 0.3%.\nAdditionally, in order to better understand our pay equity performance, we are currently conducting a global pay equity analysis, which is expected to be completed in the beginning of the second quarter of 2022. As a first step, we plan to review the conclusions internally and evaluate any potential gaps in pay equity.\nFinally, to increase transparency of our workforce, Nasdaq publishes statistics on the composition of its own global workforce by gender, and of its U.S. workforce by gender, race and ethnicity, in our U.S. EEO-1 report and our Sustainability Report, which are available on our website.\nCompensation and Benefits\nOur Total Rewards compensation program is designed to attract, retain, and empower employees to successfully execute our growth strategy. Our comprehensive Total Rewards program reflects our commitment to protecting our employees’ health, well-being and financial security.\nOur talented employees are our greatest asset, and we offer competitive compensation to attract and retain the best employees. Our pay-for-performance compensation programs includes market-competitive base salaries, annual bonuses or sales commissions, and equity.\nThe majority of our employees are granted annual long-term equity awards, enabling them to be owners of the company, committed to our long-term success and aligning their interests with the short-term and long-term interests of our shareholders.\n17\nOur Total Rewards program extends beyond compensation, offering a suite of programs, benefits, perquisites and resources to support employee priorities. In addition to cash and equity compensation, we also offer employee benefits such as health (medical, dental, vision and telehealth) insurance, fertility benefits, paid time off, paid parental leave, adoption assistance, an employee stock purchase plan, student loan repayment benefits, charitable contribution matching and a U.S. 401(k) Plan with company matching. Since the start of the pandemic, we have introduced additional benefits to support our employees, as described above under “\nCOVID-19 and Employee Safety\n.” We also provide additional benefits to our international employees based on local regulations and practice to address market-specific needs.\nCommunity Involvement\nWe are committed to creating lasting, positive change within our Company and the communities we serve.\nOur employees take pride in being active in our communities. Through our Nasdaq GoodWorks Corporate Responsibility Program, we have committed to supporting the communities in which we live and work by providing eligible full and part-time employees two paid days off per year to volunteer. We also match charitable donations of all Nasdaq employees and contractors up to $1,000, or more in certain circumstances, per calendar year. While most of our volunteer efforts in 2021 continued to remain virtual due to the pandemic, we\norganized more than 100 employee volunteer events around the world.\nAs part of Nasdaq’s ongoing commitment to diversity, equity, inclusion and culture, we have continued our series, Amplifying Black Voices, which we initiated in 2020.\nThis year, the program is a multimedia retrospective featuring works of art and photography documenting Black culture and life. These works are displayed on the Nasdaq MarketSite tower in Times Square throughout the year, enabling the entire community to view and celebrate the exhibits.\nIn September 2020, we launched the “Purpose Initiative,” which is designed to advance inclusive growth and prosperity, and we continued to expand this initiative throughout 2021. The Purpose Initiative comprises our philanthropic, community outreach, corporate sustainability, and employee volunteerism programs, all designed to leverage our unique place at the center of capital creation, markets, and technology and drive stronger economies, more equitable opportunities and contribute to a more sustainable world.\nDuring 2021, the Purpose Initiative held two company-wide roundtables, which explored topics such as advancing inclusive growth and prosperity, particularly for women of color, and investor and community engagement to increase market accessibility across race, ethnicity, gender and class.\nNasdaq also held its first “Purpose Week” to further the initiative, which included six company-wide webinars, volunteer opportunities, an innovation challenge and other events involving and recognizing company employees.\nThe mission of the Nasdaq Foundation, which was relaunched in 2020, is focused on two primary goals: (i) reimagining investor engagement to equip under-represented communities with the financial knowledge to share in the wealth that markets create; and (ii) leveraging our investment in the Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center alongside new strategic partnerships with organizations that can help build a deeper, data-led understanding of where the challenges are greatest, what existing efforts could be amplified, and how the Nasdaq Foundation can make new and distinctive contributions.\nThe Nasdaq Foundation provided six grants during 2021 to organizations that seek to fulfill that mission. These grants were awarded to, among others, Wall Street Bound, an organization to increase diversity on Wall Street; 1863 Ventures, a start-up accelerator fund assisting minority entrepreneurs throughout the growth lifecycle; and The Leave No Women Behind program, which seeks to advance female entrepreneurship in Utah by offering a suite of programs to provide female entrepreneurs with the knowledge to start or scale up a business.\nNasdaq Website and Availability of SEC Filings\nWe file periodic reports, proxy statements and other information with the SEC. The SEC maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC. The address of that site is http://www.sec.gov.\nOur website is http://ir.nasdaq.com. Information on our website is not a part of this Form 10-K.

    "text": "The risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us. Additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently believe to be immaterial may also adversely affect our business. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business, financial condition, or operating results could be adversely affected.\nRISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nWe are closely monitoring the continuing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our industry and business in the United States and worldwide, including its effect on our customers, employees, vendors and other stakeholders. The COVID-19 pandemic has created significant volatility, uncertainty and economic disruption, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\n18\nThroughout the pandemic, we have shifted to having a majority of our staff work from home and have added additional network capacity and monitoring. However, such remote work may cause heightened cybersecurity and operational risks. Certain of our global offices have re-opened on a limited basis, with applicable safety protocols in place, or expect to re-open subject to limitations during 2022. We could face disruption to our business or operations if a significant number of our employees or any of our key employees becomes ill due to the virus. Any disruption to our ability to deliver services to our clients could result in liability to our customers, regulatory fines, penalties or other sanctions, increased operational costs or harm to our reputation and brand. This, in turn, may have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations.\nThe reopening of our global offices has created and may continue to create additional risks and operational challenges and may require us to make additional investments in the design, implementation and enforcement of new workplace health and safety protocols. Even if we follow governmental guidance and what we believe to be best practices, our efforts to reopen our offices safely may not be successful and could expose our customers, employees, vendors and other stakeholders to health risks, and we could be exposed to associated liability. Furthermore, additional and/or extended governmental restrictions, new regulations or other changing conditions could cause us to temporarily re-close certain offices.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic impacts our business, financial condition, liquidity or results of operations will depend on future developments, which are uncertain and cannot be predicted, including the scope and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, the length of time of any commercial and travel limitations, the continued effectiveness of our remote work arrangements, actions taken by governmental authorities, regulators and other third parties in response to the pandemic, as well as other direct and indirect impacts on us, our exchanges, our customers, our vendors and other stakeholders.\nEconomic conditions and market factors, which are beyond our control, may adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nOur business performance is impacted by a number of factors, including general economic conditions, current or expected inflation, interest rate fluctuations, market volatility, changes in investment patterns and priorities, pandemics (such as COVID-19) and other factors that are generally beyond our control. To the extent that global or national economic conditions weaken and result in slower growth or recessions, our business is likely to be negatively impacted. Adverse market conditions could reduce customer demand for our services and the ability of our customers, lenders and other counterparties to meet their obligations to us. Poor economic conditions may result in a reduction in the demand for our products and services, including our market technology, data, indexes and IR & ESG Services, a decline\nin trading volumes or values and deterioration of the economic welfare of our listed companies.\nTrading volumes and values are driven primarily by general market conditions and declines in trading volumes or values may affect our market share and impact our pricing. In addition, our Market Services businesses receive revenues from a relatively small number of customers concentrated in the financial industry, so any event that impacts one or more customers or the financial industry in general could impact our revenues.\nThe number of listings on our markets is primarily influenced by factors such as investor demand, the global economy, available sources of financing, and tax and regulatory policies. Adverse conditions may jeopardize the ability of our listed companies to comply with the continued listing requirements of our exchanges, or reduce the number of issuers launching IPOs, including SPACs, and direct listings.\nInvestment Intelligence revenues may be significantly affected by global economic conditions. Professional subscriptions to our data products are at risk if staff reductions occur in financial services companies or if our customers consolidate, which could result in significant reductions in our professional user revenue or expose us to increased risks relating to dependence on a smaller number of customers. In addition, adverse market conditions may cause reductions in the number of non-professional investors with investments in the market and in ETP AUM tracking Nasdaq indexes as well as trading in futures linked to Nasdaq indexes.\nThere may be less demand for our IR & ESG Services or Market Technology products if global economic conditions are weak. Our customers historically reduce purchases of new services and technology when growth rates decline, thereby diminishing our opportunities to sell new products and services or upgrade existing products and services.\nA reduction in trading volumes or values, market share of trading, the number of our listed companies, or demand for Investment Intelligence, Market Technology or Corporate Platforms products and services due to economic conditions or other market factors could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nThe industries we operate in are highly competitive.\nWe face significant competition in our Market Technology, Investment Intelligence and Corporate Platforms businesses from other market participants. We face intense competition from other exchanges and markets for market share of trading activity and listings. This competition includes both product and price competition.\nThe liberalization and globalization of world markets has resulted in greater mobility of capital, greater international participation in local markets and more competition. As a result, both in the U.S. and in other countries, the competition among exchanges and other execution venues has become more intense. Marketplaces in both Europe and the U.S. have also merged to achieve greater economies of scale and scope.\n19\nRegulatory changes also have facilitated the entry of new participants in the European Union that compete with our European markets. The regulatory environment, both in the U.S. and in Europe, is structured to maintain this environment of intense competition. In addition, a high proportion of business in the securities markets is becoming concentrated in a smaller number of institutions and our revenue may therefore become concentrated in a smaller number of customers.\nWe also compete globally with other regulated exchanges and markets, ATSs, MTFs and other traditional and non-traditional execution venues. Some of these competitors also are our customers. In addition, competitors recently have launched new exchanges in the U.S., including an exchange established by a group of our customers. Competitors may develop market trading platforms that are more competitive than ours. Competitors may leverage data more effectively or enter into strategic partnerships, mergers or acquisitions that could make their trading, listings, clearing, data or technology businesses more competitive than ours.\nWe face intense price competition in all areas of our business. In particular, the trading industry is characterized by price competition. We have in the past lowered prices, and in the U.S., increased rebates for trade executions to attempt to gain or maintain market share. These strategies have not always been successful and have at times hurt operating performance. Additionally, we have also been, and may once again be, required to adjust pricing to respond to actions by competitors and new entrants, or due to new SEC regulations, which could adversely impact operating results. We also compete with respect to the pricing of data products and with respect to products for pre-trade book data and for post-trade last sale data. In addition, pricing in our Corporate Platforms, Investment Intelligence and Market Technology segments are subject to competitive pressures.\nIf we are unable to compete successfully in the industries in which we do business, our business, financial condition and operating results will be adversely affected.\nSystem limitations or failures\ncould harm our business.\nOur businesses depend on the integrity and performance of the technology, computer and communications systems supporting them. If new systems fail to operate as intended or our existing systems cannot expand to cope with increased demand or otherwise fail to perform, we could experience unanticipated disruptions in service, slower response times and delays in the introduction of new products and services. These consequences could result in service outages, lower trading volumes or values, financial losses, decreased customer satisfaction and regulatory sanctions. Our markets and the markets that rely on our technology have experienced systems failures and delays in the past and could experience future systems failures and delays.\nAlthough we currently maintain and expect to maintain multiple computer facilities that are designed to provide redundancy and back-up to reduce the risk of system\ndisruptions and have facilities in place that are expected to maintain service during a system disruption, such systems and facilities may prove inadequate. If trading volumes increase unexpectedly or other unanticipated events occur, we may need to expand and upgrade our technology, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure. We do not know whether we will be able to accurately project the rate, timing or cost of any volume increases, or expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate any increases in a timely manner.\nWhile we have programs in place to identify and minimize our exposure to vulnerabilities and work in collaboration with the technology industry to share corrective measures with our business partners, we cannot guarantee that such events will not occur in the future. Any system issue that causes an interruption in services, decreases the responsiveness of our services or otherwise affects our services could impair our reputation, damage our brand name and negatively impact our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe must continue to introduce new products, initiatives and enhancements to maintain our competitive position.\nWe intend to launch new products and initiatives and continue to explore and pursue opportunities to strengthen our business and grow our company. We may spend substantial time and money developing new products, initiatives and enhancements to existing products. If these products and initiatives are not successful, we may not be able to offset their costs, which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn our technology operations, we have invested substantial amounts in the development of system platforms, the rollout of our platforms and the adoption of new technologies. Although investments are carefully planned, there can be no assurance that the demand for such platforms or technologies will justify the related investments. If we fail to generate adequate revenue from planned system platforms or the adoption of new technologies, or if we fail to do so within the envisioned timeframe, it could have an adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. In addition, clients may delay purchases in anticipation of new products or enhancements. Additionally, it is also possible that we may allocate significant amounts of cash and other resources to product technologies or business models for which market demand is lower than anticipated. In addition, the introduction of new products by competitors, the emergence of new industry standards or the development of entirely new technologies to replace existing product offerings could render our existing or future products obsolete.\nA decline in trading and clearing volumes or values or market share will decrease our trading and clearing revenues.\nTrading and clearing volumes and values are directly affected by economic, political and market conditions, broad trends in business and finance, unforeseen market closures or other\n20\ndisruptions in trading, the level and volatility of interest rates, inflation, changes in price levels of securities and the overall level of investor confidence. In recent years, and particularly in 2020 and 2021 as the pandemic continued, trading and clearing volumes and values across our markets have fluctuated significantly depending on market conditions and other factors beyond our control. Because a significant percentage of our revenues is tied directly to the volume or value of securities traded and cleared on our markets, it is likely that a general decline in trading and clearing volumes or values would lower revenues and may adversely affect our operating results if we are unable to offset falling volumes or values through pricing changes. Declines in trading and clearing volumes or values may also impact our market share or pricing structures and adversely affect our business and financial condition.\nIf our total market share in securities decreases relative to our competitors, our venues may be viewed as less attractive sources of liquidity. If our exchanges are perceived to be less liquid, then our business, financial condition and operating results could be adversely affected.\nSince some of our exchanges offer clearing services in addition to trading services, a decline in market share of trading could lead to a decline in clearing and depository revenues. Declines in market share also could result in issuers viewing the value of a listing on our exchanges as less attractive, thereby adversely affecting our listing business. Finally, declines in market share of Nasdaq-listed securities, or recently adopted SEC rules and regulations, could lower The Nasdaq Stock Market’s share of tape pool revenues under the consolidated data plans, thereby reducing the revenues of our Market Data business.\nOur role in the global marketplace may place us at greater risk for a cyberattack.\nOur systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from security breaches. Due to COVID-19, most of our workforce has, and may continue to, work from home the majority of each week, creating a broader and more distributed network footprint and increased reliance on the home networks of employees. Some of these threats include attacks from foreign governments, hacktivists, insiders and criminal organizations. Foreign governments may seek to obtain a foothold in U.S. critical infrastructure, hacktivists may\nseek to deploy denial of service attacks to bring attention to their cause, insiders may pose a risk by human error or malicious activity and criminal organizations may seek to profit from stolen data. Computer viruses and worms also continue to be a threat with ransomware increasingly being used by criminals to extort money. Given our position in the global securities industry, we may be more likely than other companies to be a direct target, or an indirect casualty, of such events.\nWhile we continue to employ resources to monitor our systems and protect our infrastructure, these measures may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. Any system issue, whether as a result of an intentional\nbreach, collateral damage from a new virus or a non-malicious act, could damage our reputation and cause us to lose customers, experience lower trading volumes or values, incur significant liabilities or otherwise have a negative impact on our business, financial condition and operating results. Any system breach may go undetected for an extended period of time. As cybersecurity threats continue to increase in frequency and sophistication, and as the domestic and international regulatory and compliance structure related to information security, data privacy and data usage becomes increasingly complex and exacting, we may be required to devote significant additional resources to strengthen our cybersecurity capabilities, and to identify and remediate any security vulnerabilities, which could adversely impact our business, financial condition and operating results. Further, cybersecurity incidents that impact our vendors and other third parties that support our organization and industry could directly or indirectly impact us. For example, in December 2021, the Log4j security vulnerability was widely publicized. It did not have an impact to our business or operations, including our core market system environment. There can be no assurance we will be able to identify and mitigate every incident involving cybersecurity attacks, breaches or incidents.\nThe success of our business depends on our ability to keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry. Specifically, we must complete development of, successfully implement and maintain platforms that have the functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed required by our business and our regulators, as well as by our customers.\nThe markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology, evolving industry and regulatory standards, frequent enhancements to existing products and services, the adoption of new services and products and changing customer demands. We are reliant on our customers that purchase our on-premise solutions to maintain a certain level of network infrastructure for our products to operate and to allow for our support of those products, and there is no assurance that a customer will implement such measures. We may not be able to keep up with rapid technological and other competitive changes affecting our industry. For example, we must continue to enhance our platforms to remain competitive as well as to address our regulatory responsibilities, and our business will be negatively affected if our platforms or the technology solutions we sell to our customers fail to function as expected. If we are unable to develop our platforms to include other products and markets, or if our platforms do not have the required functionality, performance, capacity, reliability and speed required by our business and our regulators, as well as by our customers, we may not be able to compete successfully. Further, our failure to anticipate or respond adequately to changes in technology and customer preferences or any significant delays in product development efforts, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\n21\nFailure to attract and retain key personnel may adversely affect our ability to conduct our business.\nOur future success depends, in large part, upon our ability to attract and retain highly qualified and skilled professional personnel that can learn and embrace new technologies. In the current tight labor market, we have intensified our efforts to recruit and retain talent. Competition for key personnel in the various localities and business segments in which we operate is intense. We have, and may continue to, experience higher compensation costs to retain personnel, and hire new talent, that may not be offset by improved productivity, higher revenues or increased sales. Our ability to attract and retain key personnel, in particular senior officers or technology personnel, will be dependent on a number of factors, including prevailing market conditions, office/remote working arrangements and compensation and benefit packages offered by companies competing for the same talent. There is no guarantee that we will have the continued service of key employees who we rely upon to execute our business strategy and identify and pursue strategic opportunities and initiatives. In particular, we may have to incur costs to replace senior officers or other key employees who leave, and our ability to execute our business strategy could be impaired if we are unable to replace such persons in a timely manner or at all.\nOur clearinghouse operations expose us to risks, including credit or liquidity risks that may include defaults by clearing members, or insufficiencies in margins or default funds.\nWe are subject to risks relating to our operation of a clearinghouse, including counterparty and liquidity risks, risk of defaults by clearing members and risks associated with adequacy of the customer margin and of default funds. Our clearinghouse operations expose us to counterparties with differing risk profiles. We may be adversely impacted by the financial distress or failure of a clearing member, which may cause us negative financial impact, reputational harm or regulatory consequences, including litigation or regulatory enforcement actions.\nIn September 2018, a member of the Nasdaq Clearing commodities market defaulted due to an inability to post sufficient collateral to cover increased margin requirements for the positions of the relevant member. For further discussion of the default, see Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements. There are no assurances that similar defaults will not occur again, which could result in losses. To the extent that our regulatory capital and risk management policies are not adequate to manage future financial and operational risks in our clearinghouse, we may experience adverse consequences to our operating results or ability to conduct our business.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents.\nWe are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties\nmay default on their obligations to us due to the effects of COVID-19 on their business, bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons.\nWe clear a range of equity-related and fixed-income-related derivative products, commodities and resale and repurchase agreements. We assume the counterparty risk for all transactions that are cleared through Nasdaq Clearing on our markets and guarantee that our cleared contracts will be honored. We enforce minimum financial and operational criteria for membership eligibility, require members and investors to provide collateral, and maintain established risk policies and procedures to ensure that the counterparty risks are properly monitored and proactively managed; however, none of these measures provides absolute assurance against experiencing financial losses from defaults by our counterparties on their obligations. No guarantee can be given that the collateral provided will at all times be sufficient. Although we maintain clearing capital resources to serve as an additional layer of protection to help ensure that we are able to meet our obligations, these resources also may not be sufficient.\nWe also have credit risk related to transaction and subscription-based revenues that are billed to customers on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears.\nCredit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nTechnology issues relating to our role as exclusive processor for Nasdaq-listed stocks could affect our business.\nNasdaq, as technology provider to the UTP Operating Committee, has implemented measures to enhance the resiliency of the existing processor system. Nasdaq transferred the processor technology platform to our INET platform and this migration further enhanced the resiliency of the processor systems. We further improved the systems' resiliency by adding the UTP SnapShot service. However, if future outages occur or the processor systems fail to function properly while we are operating the systems, it could have an adverse effect on our business, reputation and financial condition.\nStagnation or decline in the listings market could have an adverse effect on our revenues.\nThe market for listings is dependent on the prosperity of companies and the availability of risk capital. A stagnation or decline in the number of new listings, or an increase in the number of delistings, on The Nasdaq Stock Market and the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges could cause a decrease in revenues for future years. Furthermore, a prolonged decrease in the number of listings could negatively impact the growth of our transactions revenues. Our IR & ESG Services business is also impacted by declines in the listings market or increases in acquisitions activity as there will be fewer publicly-traded customers that need our products.\n22\nRISKS RELATED TO TRANSACTIONAL ACTIVITIES AND STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS\nWe may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses, which may result in an inability to realize the anticipated benefits of our acquisitions.\nWe must rationalize, coordinate and integrate the operations of our acquired businesses. This process involves complex technological, operational and personnel-related challenges, which are time-consuming and expensive and may disrupt our business. The difficulties, costs and delays that could be encountered may include:\n•\ndifficulties, costs or complications in combining the companies’ operations, including technology platforms, which could lead to us not achieving the synergies we anticipate or customers not renewing their contracts with us as we migrate platforms;\n•\nincompatibility of systems and operating methods;\n•\nreliance on, or provision of, transition services;\n•\ninability to use capital assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company;\n•\ndifficulties of complying with government-imposed regulations in the U.S. and abroad, which may be conflicting;\n•\nresolving possible inconsistencies in standards, controls, procedures and policies, business cultures and compensation structures;\n•\nthe diversion of management’s attention from ongoing business concerns and other strategic opportunities;\n•\ndifficulties in operating businesses we have not operated before;\n•\ndifficulties of integrating multiple acquired businesses simultaneously;\n•\nthe retention of key employees and management;\n•\nthe implementation of disclosure controls, internal controls and financial reporting systems at non-U.S. subsidiaries to enable us to comply with U.S. GAAP and U.S. securities laws and regulations, including the Sarbanes Oxley Act of 2002, required as a result of our status as a reporting company under the Exchange Act;\n•\nthe coordination of geographically separate organizations;\n•\nthe coordination and consolidation of ongoing and future research and development efforts;\n•\npossible tax costs or inefficiencies associated with integrating the operations of a combined company;\n•\npre-tax restructuring and revenue investment costs;\n•\nthe retention of strategic partners and attracting new strategic partners; and\n•\nnegative impacts on employee morale and performance as a result of job changes and reassignments.\nForeign acquisitions involve risks in addition to those mentioned above, including those related to integration of operations across different cultures and languages, our ability\nto enforce contracts in various jurisdictions, currency risks and the particular economic, political and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. We may not be able to address these risks successfully, or at all, without incurring significant costs, delays or other operating problems that could disrupt our business and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition.\nFor these reasons, we may not achieve the anticipated financial and strategic benefits from our acquisitions and strategic initiatives. Any actual cost savings and synergies may be lower than we expect and may take a longer time to achieve than we anticipate, and we may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of acquisitions.\nWe rely on third parties to perform certain functions, and our business could be adversely affected if these third parties fail to perform as expected or experience service interruptions affecting our operations.\nWe rely on third parties for regulatory, data center, cloud, data storage and processing, data content, clearing and other services. Interruptions or delays in services from our third-party data center hosting facilities or cloud computing platform providers could impair the delivery of our services and harm our business. To the extent that any of our vendors or other third-party service providers experiences difficulties or a significant disruption, breach or outage, materially changes their business relationship with us or is unable for any reason to perform their obligations, our business or our reputation may be materially adversely affected.\nOur access to cloud service provider infrastructure could be limited by a number of events, including technical or infrastructure failures, natural disasters or cybersecurity attacks. As we continue to grow our SaaS businesses, our dependency on the continuing operation and availability of these cloud service providers increases. If our cloud services from third party providers are unavailable to us for any reason, our clients may not be able to access our exchanges or certain of our cloud products or features, which could significantly impact our reputation, operations, business, and financial results.\nFor example, in 2022, we will begin to use AWS to migrate our North American markets to AWS in a phased approach, starting with Nasdaq MRX. AWS operates a platform that we use to provide services to our clients, and therefore we are vulnerable to Nasdaq-specific service outages on the AWS platform. If AWS does not deliver our system requirements on time, fails to provide maintenance and support to our specifications or the migration experiences integration challenges, the successful migration of our exchanges to the AWS cloud platform may be significantly delayed, which may adversely affect our reputation and financial results.\nWe also rely on members of our trading community to maintain markets and add liquidity. To the extent that any of our largest members experiences difficulties, materially changes its business relationship with us or is unable for any reason to perform market making activities, our business or our reputation may be materially adversely affected.\n23\nWe may be required to recognize impairments of our goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets in the future.\nOur business acquisitions typically result in the recording of goodwill and intangible assets, and the recorded values of those assets may become impaired in the future. As of December 31, 2021, goodwill totaled $8.4 billion and intangible assets, net of accumulated amortization, totaled $2.8 billion. The determination of the value of such goodwill and intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect our consolidated financial statements.\nWe assess goodwill and intangible assets, as well as other long-lived assets, including equity method investments, equity securities, and property and equipment, for potential impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise. We estimate the fair value of such assets by assessing many factors, including historical performance and projected cash flows. Considerable management judgment is necessary to project future cash flows and evaluate the impact of expected operating and macroeconomic changes on these cash flows. The estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with our internal planning process. However, there are inherent uncertainties in these estimates.\nThere were no impairment charges recorded relating to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets and there were no material impairment charges recorded relating to other long-lived assets in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nWe may experience future events that may result in asset impairments. Future disruptions to our business, prolonged economic weakness, due to COVID-19 or otherwise, or significant declines in operating results at any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in impairment charges to goodwill, intangible assets or other long-lived assets. A significant impairment charge in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operating results.\nAcquisitions, divestments, investments, joint ventures and other transactional activities may require significant resources and/or result in significant unanticipated losses, costs or liabilities.\nOver the past several years, acquisitions have been significant factors in our growth. We have, and may continue to, divest additional businesses or assets in the future. Although we cannot predict our transactional activities, we believe that additional acquisitions, divestments, investments, joint ventures and other transactional activities will be important to our strategy. Such transactions may be material in size and scope. Many of the other potential purchasers of assets in our industry have greater financial resources than we have. Therefore, we cannot be sure that we will be able to complete future transactions on terms favorable to us.\nWe also invest in early-stage companies through our Nasdaq Ventures program and hold minority interests in other entities. Given the size of these investments, we do not have operational control of these entities and may have limited visibility into risk management practices. Thus, we may be subject to additional capital requirements in certain circumstances and financial and reputational risks if there are operational failures.\nWe may finance future transactions by issuing additional equity and/or debt. The issuance of additional equity in connection with any such transaction could be substantially dilutive to existing shareholders. In addition, the announcement or implementation of future transactions by us or others could have a material effect on the price of our common stock. The issuance of additional debt could increase our leverage substantially. We could face financial risks associated with incurring additional debt, particularly if the debt results in significant incremental leverage. Additional debt may reduce our liquidity, curtail our access to financing markets, impact our standing with credit rating agencies and increase the cash flow required for debt service. Any incremental debt incurred to finance a transaction could also place significant constraints on the operation of our business.\nFurthermore, any future transactions could entail a number of additional risks, including:\n•\nthe inability to maintain key pre-transaction business relationships;\n•\nincreased operating costs;\n•\nthe inability to meet our target for return on invested capital;\n•\nincreased debt obligations, which may adversely affect our targeted debt ratios;\n•\nrisks to the continued achievement of our strategic direction;\n•\nrisks associated with divesting employees, customers or vendors when divesting businesses or assets;\n•\ndeclines in the value of investments;\n•\nexposure to unanticipated liabilities, including after a transaction is completed;\n•\nincurred but unreported claims for an acquired company;\n•\ndifficulties in realizing projected efficiencies, synergies and cost savings; and\n•\nchanges in our credit rating and financing costs.\nCharges to earnings resulting from acquisition, integration and restructuring costs may materially adversely affect the market value of our common stock.\nIn accordance with U.S. GAAP, we account for the completion of our acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting. We allocate the total estimated purchase price to net tangible and identifiable intangible assets based on\n24\ntheir fair values as of the date of completion of the acquisition and record the excess of the purchase price over those fair values as goodwill. Our financial results, including earnings per share, could be adversely affected by a number of financial adjustments including the following:\n•\nwe may incur additional amortization expense over the estimated useful lives of certain of the intangible assets acquired in connection with acquisitions during such estimated useful lives;\n•\nwe may have additional depreciation expense as a result of recording acquired tangible assets at fair value, in accordance with U.S. GAAP, as compared to book value as recorded;\n•\nto the extent the value of goodwill or intangible assets becomes impaired, we may be required to incur material charges relating to the impairment of those assets;\n•\nwe may incur additional costs from integrating our acquisitions. The success of our acquisitions depends, in part, on our ability to integrate these businesses into our existing operations and realize anticipated cost savings, revenue synergies and growth opportunities; and\n•\nwe may incur restructuring costs in connection with the reorganization of any of our businesses.\nRISKS RELATED TO LEGAL AND REGULATORY MATTERS\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and may be subject to censures, fines and enforcement proceedings if we fail to comply with regulatory obligations that can be ambiguous and can change unexpectedly.\nWe operate in a highly regulated industry and are subject to extensive regulation in the U.S., Europe and Canada. The securities trading industry is subject to significant regulatory oversight and could be subject to increased governmental and public scrutiny in the future that can change in response to global conditions and events, or due to changes in trading patterns, such as due to the recent volatility involving the trading of certain stocks.\nOur ability to comply with complex and changing regulation is largely dependent on our establishment and maintenance of compliance, audit and reporting systems that can quickly adapt and respond, as well as our ability to attract and retain qualified compliance and other risk management personnel. There is no assurance that our policies and procedures will always be effective or that we will always be successful in monitoring or evaluating the risks to which we are or may be exposed.\nOur regulated markets are subject to audits, investigations, administrative proceedings and enforcement actions relating to compliance with applicable rules and regulations. Regulators have broad powers to impose fines, penalties or censure, issue cease-and-desist orders, prohibit operations, revoke licenses or registrations and impose other sanctions on our exchanges, broker-dealers, central securities\ndepositories, clearinghouse and markets for violations of applicable requirements.\nIn the future, we could be subject to regulatory investigations or enforcement proceedings that could result in substantial sanctions, including revocation of our operating licenses. Any such investigations or proceedings, whether successful or unsuccessful, could result in substantial costs, the diversion of resources, including management time, and potential harm to our reputation, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations or financial condition. In addition, our exchanges could be required to modify or restructure their regulatory functions in response to any changes in the regulatory environment, or they may be required to rely on third parties to perform regulatory and oversight functions, each of which may require us to incur substantial expenses and may harm our reputation if our regulatory services are deemed inadequate.\nThe regulatory framework under which we operate and new regulatory requirements or new interpretations of existing regulatory requirements could require substantial time and resources for compliance, which could make it difficult and costly for us to operate our business.\nUnder current U.S. federal securities laws, changes in the rules and operations of our securities markets, including our pricing structure, must be reviewed and in many cases explicitly approved by the SEC. The SEC may approve, disapprove, or recommend changes to proposals that we submit. In addition, the SEC may delay either the approval process or the initiation of the public comment process. Favorable SEC rulings and interpretations can be challenged in and reversed by federal courts of appeals, reducing or eliminating the value of such prior interpretations. Any delay in approving changes, or the altering of any proposed change, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe must compete not only with ATSs that are not subject to the same SEC approval process but also with other exchanges that may have lower regulation and surveillance costs than us. There is a risk that trading will shift to exchanges that charge lower fees because, among other reasons, they spend significantly less on regulation.\nIn 2016, the SEC approved a plan for Nasdaq and other exchanges to establish a CAT, to improve regulators’ ability to monitor trading activity. In addition to increased regulatory obligations, implementation of a consolidated audit trail has resulted in significant additional expenditures, including to implement the new technology to meet any of the plan’s requirements. Creating the CAT has required the development and implementation of complex and costly technology. This development effort has been funded by the SROs (including Nasdaq) in exchange for promissory notes that Nasdaq expects to be repaid at such time that the SEC approves the assessment of fees for the funding of the CAT. The SEC could determine not to approve the assessment of such fees in which case some or all of the promissory notes would not be repaid. In addition, the ongoing failure to\n25\ntimely launch or properly operate such technology exposes Nasdaq and other exchanges to SEC fines. As of December 31, 2021, we have accrued approximately $54 million as a receivable in connection with our portion of expenses related to the CAT implementation.\nIn addition, our registered broker-dealer subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the SEC, FINRA and other SROs. These subsidiaries are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity, which require that they comply with certain minimum capital requirements. The SEC and FINRA impose rules that require notification when a broker-dealer’s net capital falls below certain predefined criteria, dictate the ratio of debt to equity in the regulatory capital composition of a broker-dealer and constrain the ability of a broker-dealer to expand its business under certain circumstances. Additionally, the SEC’s Uniform Net Capital Rule and FINRA rules impose certain requirements that may have the effect of prohibiting a broker-dealer from distributing or withdrawing capital and requiring prior notice to the SEC and FINRA for certain withdrawals of capital. Any failure to comply with these broker-dealer regulations could have a material adverse effect on the operation of our business, financial condition and operating results.\nOur non-U.S. business is subject to regulatory oversight in all the countries in which we operate regulated businesses, such as exchanges, clearinghouses or central securities depositories. In these countries, we have received authorization from the relevant authorities to conduct our regulated business activities. The authorities may issue regulatory fines or may ultimately revoke our authorizations if we do not suitably carry out our regulated business activities. The authorities are also entitled to request that we adopt measures in order to ensure that we continue to fulfill the authorities’ requirements. Additionally, we are subject to the obligations under the Benchmark Regulation ((EU) 2016/1011), compliance with which could be costly or cause a change in our business practices.\nFurthermore, certain of our customers operate in a highly regulated industry. Regulatory authorities could impose regulatory changes that could impact the ability of our customers to use our exchanges. The loss of a significant number of customers or a reduction in trading activity on any of our exchanges as a result of such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nRegulatory changes and changes in market structure and proprietary data could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nRegulatory changes adopted by the SEC or other regulators of our markets, and regulatory changes that our markets may adopt in fulfillment of their regulatory obligations, could materially affect our business operations. In recent years, there has been increased regulatory and governmental focus on issues affecting the securities markets, including market structure, technological oversight and fees for proprietary market data, connectivity and transactions. The SEC, FINRA\nand the national securities exchanges have introduced several initiatives to ensure the oversight, integrity and resilience of markets.\nWith respect to our regulated businesses, our business model can be severely impacted by policy decisions. In May 2020, the SEC adopted a rule to require changes to the governance of securities information processors. In December 2020, the SEC adopted a rule to modify the infrastructure for the collection, consolidation and dissemination of market data for exchange-listed national market stocks. If either or both of these rules are fully implemented, they may adversely affect our revenues. The timing for the implementation of these rules is currently unknown, and we believe they may take two or more years to fully implement. If the rules are ultimately implemented as set forth in their adopting releases, demand for certain of our proprietary tape share data products may be reduced, or we may have to reduce our pricing to compete with other entrants into the market for consolidated data. Our opponents in some markets are larger and better funded and, if successful in influencing certain policies, may successfully advocate for positions that adversely impact our business. These regulatory changes could impose significant costs, including litigation costs, and other obligations on the operation of our exchanges and processor systems and have other impacts on our business.\nIn Canada, all new marketplace fees and changes to existing fees, including trading and market data fees, must be filed with and approved by the Ontario Securities Commission. The Canadian Securities Administrators adopted a Data Fees Methodology that restricts the total amount of fees that can be charged by all marketplaces to a reference benchmark. Currently, all marketplaces are subject to annual reviews of their market data fees tying market data revenues to pre- and post- trade market share metrics. Permitted fee ranges are based on an interim domestic benchmark that is subject to change to an international benchmark, which could lower the permitted fees charged by marketplaces, which could adversely impact our revenues.\nOur European exchanges currently offer market data products to customers on a non-discriminatory and reasonable commercial basis. The MiFID II/MiFIR rules entail that the price for regulated market data such as pre- and post-trade data shall be based\non cost plus a reasonable margin. However, these terms are not clearly defined. There is a risk that a different interpretation of these terms may influence the fees for European market data products adversely. In addition, any future actions by European Union institutions could affect our ability to offer market data products in the same manner as today, thereby causing an adverse effect on our market data revenues.\nWe are subject to litigation risks and other liabilities.\nMany aspects of our business potentially involve substantial liability risks. Although under current law we are immune from private suits arising from conduct within our regulatory authority and from acts and forbearances incident to the exercise of our regulatory authority, this immunity only\n26\ncovers certain of our activities in the U.S., and we could be exposed to liability under national and local laws, court decisions and rules and regulations promulgated by regulatory agencies.\nSome of our other liability risks arise under the laws and regulations relating to the tax, employment, intellectual property, anti-money laundering, technology export, foreign asset controls, foreign corrupt practices, employee labor and employment areas, including anti-discrimination and fair-pay laws and regulations.\nLiability could also result from disputes over the terms of a trade, claims that a system failure or delay cost a customer money, claims we entered into an unauthorized transaction or claims that we provided materially false or misleading statements in connection with a securities transaction. As we intend to defend any such litigation actively, significant legal expenses could be incurred. Although we carry insurance that may limit our risk of damages in some cases, we still may sustain uncovered losses or losses in excess of available insurance that would affect our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe have self-regulatory obligations and also operate for-profit businesses, and these two roles may create conflicts of interest.\nWe have obligations to regulate and monitor activities on our markets and ensure compliance with applicable law and the rules of our markets by market participants and listed companies. In the U.S., some have expressed concern about potential conflicts of interest of “for-profit” markets performing the regulatory functions of an SRO. We perform regulatory functions and bear regulatory responsibility related to our listed companies and our markets. Any failure by us to diligently and fairly regulate our markets or to otherwise fulfill our regulatory obligations could significantly harm our reputation, prompt SEC scrutiny and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nOur Nordic and Baltic exchanges monitor trading and compliance with listing standards in accordance with the European Union’s Market Abuse Regulation and other applicable laws. The prime objective of such monitoring activities is to promote confidence in the exchanges among the general public and to ensure fair and orderly functioning markets. The monitoring functions within the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges are the responsibility of the surveillance departments or other surveillance personnel. The surveillance departments or personnel are intended to strengthen the integrity of and confidence in these exchanges and to avoid conflicts of interest. Any failure to diligently and fairly regulate the Nordic and Baltic exchanges could significantly harm our reputation, prompt scrutiny from regulators and adversely affect our business and reputation.\nLaws and regulations regarding the handling of personal data and information may affect our services or result in increased costs, legal claims or fines against us.\nOur business relies on the processing of data in many jurisdictions and the movement of data, including personal data, across national borders. Legal and contractual requirements relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data continue to evolve; regulatory scrutiny and customer requirements in this area are increasing around the world. Significant uncertainty exists as privacy and data protection laws may be interpreted and applied differently across jurisdictions and may create inconsistent or conflicting requirements with privacy and other laws to which we are subject.\nLaws and regulations such as the European Union General Data Protection Regulation, or GDPR, and the California Consumer Privacy Act, or CCPA, can have application and effect beyond their territorial limits, and require companies to meet new requirements regarding the handling of personal data. In addition to directly applying to certain Nasdaq business activities, these laws impact many of our customers, which may affect their requirements and decisions related to services that we offer. Our efforts to comply with GDPR, CCPA and other privacy and data protection laws may entail substantial expenses, may divert resources from other initiatives and projects, and could impact the services that we offer. Furthermore, enforcement actions and investigations by regulatory authorities, as well as third party litigation, related to data security incidents and privacy violations continue to increase. The enactment of more restrictive laws, rules or regulations, future enforcement actions or investigations, or the creation of new rights to pursue damages could impact us through increased costs or restrictions on our business, and noncompliance could result in regulatory penalties and significant legal liability.\nChanges in tax laws, regulations or policies could have a material adverse effect on our financial results.\nLike other corporations, we are subject to taxes at the federal, state and local levels, as well as in non-U.S. jurisdictions. Changes in tax laws, regulations or policies could result in us having to pay higher taxes, which may reduce our net income, or could adversely affect our ability to continue our capital allocation program or effect strategic transactions in a tax-favorable manner. In addition, such changes, including federal or state financial transaction taxes, may increase the cost of our offerings or services, which may cause our clients to reduce their use of our services.\nIn addition, some of our subsidiaries are subject to tax in the jurisdictions in which they are organized or operate. In computing our tax obligation in these jurisdictions, we take various tax positions. We cannot ensure that upon review of these positions, the applicable authorities will agree with our positions. A successful challenge by a tax authority could result in additional taxes imposed on our clients or our subsidiaries.\n27\nRISKS RELATED TO LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nOur credit rating could increase the cost of our funding from the capital markets.\nOur debt is currently rated investment grade by two of the major rating agencies. These rating agencies regularly evaluate us, and their ratings of our long-term debt and commercial paper are based on a number of factors, including our financial strength and corporate development activity, as well as factors not entirely within our control, including conditions affecting our industry generally. There can be no assurance that we will maintain our current ratings. Our failure to maintain such ratings could reduce or eliminate our ability to issue commercial paper and adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which we are able to obtain funding and increase our cost of capital. A reduction in credit ratings would also result in increases in the cost of our commercial paper and other outstanding debt as the interest rate on the outstanding amounts under our credit facilities and our senior notes fluctuates based on our credit ratings.\nOur leverage limits our financial flexibility, increases our exposure to weakening economic conditions and may adversely affect our ability to obtain additional financing.\nOur indebtedness as of December 31, 2021 was $5.8 billion. We may borrow additional amounts by utilizing available liquidity under our existing credit facilities, issuing additional debt securities or issuing short-term, unsecured commercial paper notes through our commercial paper program.\nOur leverage could:\n•\nreduce funds available to us for operations and general corporate purposes or for capital expenditures as a result of the dedication of a substantial portion of our consolidated cash flow from operations to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness;\n•\nincrease our exposure to a continued downturn in general economic conditions;\n•\nplace us at a competitive disadvantage compared with our competitors with less debt;\n•\naffect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for refinancing indebtedness, acquisitions, working capital, capital expenditures or other purposes; and\n•\nincrease our cost of debt and reduce or eliminate our ability to issue commercial paper.\nIn addition, we must comply with the covenants in our credit facilities. Among other things, these covenants restrict our ability to effect certain fundamental transactions, dispose of certain assets, incur additional indebtedness and grant liens on assets. Failure to meet any of the covenant terms of our credit facilities could result in an event of default. If an event of default occurs, and we are unable to receive a waiver of default, our lenders may increase our borrowing costs, restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings and accelerate all amounts outstanding.\nWe will need to invest in our operations to maintain and grow our business and to integrate acquisitions, and we may need additional funds, which may not be readily available.\nWe depend on the availability of adequate capital to maintain and develop our business. Although we believe that we can meet our current capital requirements from internally generated funds, cash on hand and borrowings under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program, if the capital and credit markets experience volatility, access to capital or credit may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all. Limited access to capital or credit in the future could have an impact on our ability to refinance debt, maintain our credit rating, meet our regulatory capital requirements, engage in strategic initiatives, make acquisitions or strategic investments in other companies, pay dividends, repurchase our stock or react to changing economic and business conditions. If we are unable to fund our capital or credit requirements, it could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nIn addition to our debt obligations, we will need to continue to invest in our operations for the foreseeable future to integrate acquired businesses and to fund new initiatives. If we do not achieve the expected operating results, we will need to reallocate our cash resources. This may include borrowing additional funds to service debt payments, which may impair our ability to make investments in our business or to integrate acquired businesses.\nIf we need to raise funds through issuing additional equity, our equity holders will suffer dilution. If we need to raise funds through incurring additional debt, we may become subject to covenants more restrictive than those contained in our credit facilities, the indentures governing our notes and our other debt instruments. Furthermore, if adverse economic conditions occur, we could experience decreased revenues from our operations which could affect our ability to satisfy financial and other restrictive covenants to which we are subject under our existing indebtedness.\nRISKS RELATED TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND BRAND REPUTATION\nDamage to our reputation or brand name could have a material adverse effect on our businesses.\nOne of our competitive strengths is our strong reputation and brand name. Various issues may give rise to reputational risk, including issues relating to:\n•\nour ability to maintain the security of our data and systems;\n•\nthe quality and reliability of our technology platforms and systems;\n•\nthe ability to fulfill our regulatory obligations;\n•\nthe ability to execute our business plan, key initiatives or new business ventures and the ability to keep up with changing customer demand;\n•\nthe representation of our business in the media;\n28\n•\nthe accuracy of our financial statements and other financial and statistical information;\n•\nthe accuracy of our financial guidance or other information provided to our investors;\n•\nthe quality of our corporate governance structure;\n•\nthe quality of our products, including the reliability of our transaction-based, IR & ESG Services and market technology products, the accuracy of the quote and trade information provided by our Market Data business and the accuracy of calculations used by our Indexes business for indexes and unit investment trusts;\n•\nthe quality of our disclosure controls or internal controls over financial reporting, including any failures in supervision;\n•\nextreme price volatility on our markets;\n•\nany negative publicity surrounding our listed companies or our listing rules;\n•\nany negative publicity surrounding the use of our products and/or services by our customers, including in connection with emerging asset classes such as crypto assets; and\n•\nany misconduct, fraudulent activity or theft by our employees or other persons formerly or currently associated with us.\nAlthough we monitor developments, including social media, for areas of potential risk to our brand and reputation, negative publicity or misrepresentations by third parties, particularly on social media, may adversely impact our credibility as a leader in the global capital markets and as a source for data and analytics, and may have an adverse effect on our brands, business and operating results. Damage to our reputation could cause some issuers not to list their securities on our exchanges, as well as reduce the trading volumes or values on our exchanges or cause us to lose customers in our Market Data, Index, IR & ESG Services or Market Technology businesses. This, in turn, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nFailure to meet customer expectations or deadlines for the implementation of our products could result in negative publicity, losses and reduced sales, each of which may harm our reputation, business and results of operations.\nWe generally mutually agree with our customers on the duration, budget and costs associated with the implementation of certain of our products, particularly our Market Technology large-scale market infrastructure projects. Various factors may cause implementations to be delayed, inefficient or otherwise unsuccessful, including due to unforeseen project complexities, our deployment of insufficient resources, logistical challenges due to the effects of COVID-19 or other external factors. The effects of a failure to meet an implementation schedule could include monetary credits for current or future service engagements, a reduction in fees for the project, or the expenditure of additional expenses to mitigate such delays. In addition, time-\nconsuming implementations may also increase the personnel we must allocate to such customer, thereby increasing our costs and diverting attention from other projects. Unsuccessful, lengthy, or costly customer implementation projects could result in claims from customers, decreased customer satisfaction, harm to our reputation, and opportunities for competitors to displace us, each of which could have an adverse effect on our reputation, business and results of operations.\nFailure to protect our intellectual property rights, or allegations that we have infringed on the intellectual property rights of others, could harm our brand-building efforts and ability to compete effectively.\nTo protect our intellectual property rights, we rely on a combination of trademark laws, copyright laws, patent laws, trade secret protection, confidentiality agreements and other contractual arrangements with our affiliates, clients, strategic partners, employees and others. However, the efforts we have taken to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights might not be sufficient, or effective, at stopping unauthorized use of those rights. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use of, or take appropriate steps to enforce, our intellectual property rights.\nWe have registered, or applied to register, our trademarks in the United States and in over 50 foreign jurisdictions and have pending U.S. and foreign applications for other trademarks. We also maintain copyright protection for software products\nand pursue patent protection for inventions developed by us. We hold a number of patents, patent applications and licenses in the United States and other foreign jurisdictions. However, effective trademark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection might not be available or cost-effective in every country in which our services and products are offered. Moreover, changes in patent law, such as changes in the law regarding patentable subject matter, could also impact our ability to obtain patent protection for our innovations. There is also a risk that the scope of protection under our patents may not be sufficient in some cases, or that existing patents may be deemed invalid or unenforceable. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm our brand and affect our ability to compete effectively. Further, defending our intellectual property rights could result in the expenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\nThird parties may assert intellectual property rights claims against us, which may be costly to defend, could require the payment of damages and could limit our ability to use certain technologies, trademarks or other intellectual property. Any intellectual property claims, with or without merit, could be expensive to litigate or settle and could divert management resources and attention. Successful challenges against us could require us to modify or discontinue our use of technology or business processes where such use is found to infringe or violate the rights of others, or require us to purchase licenses from third parties, any of which could adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\n29\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nWe are a holding company that depends on cash flow from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations, and any restrictions on our subsidiaries’ ability to pay dividends or make other payments to us may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nAs a holding company, we require dividends and other payments from our subsidiaries to meet cash requirements. Minimum capital requirements mandated by regulatory authorities having jurisdiction over some of our regulated subsidiaries indirectly restrict the amount of dividends paid upstream.\nIn addition, unremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are used to finance our international operations and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\nIf our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends and make other payments to us when needed, we may be unable to satisfy our obligations, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results.\nWe may experience fluctuations in our operating results, which may adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nOur industry is risky and unpredictable and is directly affected by many national and international factors beyond our control, including:\n•\neconomic, political and geopolitical market conditions;\n•\nnatural disasters, terrorism, pandemics, war or other catastrophes;\n•\nbroad trends in finance and technology;\n•\nchanges in price levels and volatility in the stock markets;\n•\nthe level and volatility of interest rates;\n•\nvolatility in commodity markets, including the energy markets;\n•\nchanges in government monetary or tax policy;\n•\nthe imposition of governmental economic sanctions on countries in which we do business or where we plan to expand our business;\n•\nthe perceived attractiveness of the U.S. or European capital markets; and\n•\ninflation.\nAny one of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and operating results by causing a substantial decline in the financial services markets and reducing trading volumes or values.\nAdditionally, since borrowings under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates and commercial paper is issued at prevailing interest rates, any increase in interest rates on debt that we have not fixed using interest rate hedges will increase our interest expense, reduce our cash flow or increase the cost of future borrowings or refinancings. Other than variable rate debt, we believe our business has relatively large fixed costs and low variable costs, which magnifies the impact of\nrevenue fluctuations on our operating results. As a result, a decline in our revenue may lead to a relatively larger impact on operating results. A substantial portion of our operating expenses is related to personnel costs, regulation and corporate overhead, none of which can be adjusted quickly and some of which cannot be adjusted at all. Our operating expense levels are based on our expectations for future revenue. If actual revenue is below management’s expectations, or if our expenses increase before revenues do, both revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating results would be materially and adversely affected. Because of these factors, it is possible that our operating results or other operating metrics may fail to meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors. If this happens, the market price of our common stock may be adversely affected.\nOur operational processes are subject to the risk of error, which may result in financial loss or reputational damage.\nWe have instituted extensive controls to reduce the risk of error inherent in our operations; however, such risk cannot completely be eliminated. Our businesses are highly dependent on our ability to process and report, on a daily basis, a large number of transactions across numerous and diverse markets. Some of our operations require complex processes, and the introduction of new products or services or changes in processes or reporting due to regulatory requirements may result in an increased risk of errors for a period after implementation. Additionally, the likelihood of such errors or vulnerabilities is heightened as we acquire new products from third parties, whether as a result of acquisitions or otherwise.\nData, other content or information that we distribute may contain errors or be delayed, causing reputational harm. Use of our products and services as part of the investment process creates the risk that clients, or the parties whose assets are managed by our clients, may pursue claims against us in the event of such delay or error. Even with a favorable outcome, significant litigation against us might unduly burden management, personnel, financial and other resources.\nIn addition, the sophisticated software we sell to our customers may contain undetected errors or vulnerabilities, some of which may be discovered only after delivery, or could fail to perform its intended purpose. Because our clients depend on our solutions for critical business functions, any service interruptions, failures or other issues may result in lost or delayed market acceptance and lost sales, or negative customer experiences that could damage our reputation, resulting in the loss of customers, loss of revenues and liability for damages, which may adversely affect our business and financial results.\nClimate change may have a long-term adverse impact on our business, and climate change disclosure requirements may reduce demand for listings on our exchanges.\nWhile we seek to mitigate our business risks associated with climate change by establishing robust environmental and sustainability programs, there are inherent climate related risks wherever our business is conducted. There is an\n30\nincreased focus from our investors, clients, employees, and other stakeholders concerning corporate citizenship and sustainability matters. Access to clean water and reliable energy in the communities where we conduct our business, whether for our offices, data centers, vendors, clients or other stakeholders, is a priority. For example, changes in weather where we operate may increase the costs of powering and cooling our data centers or the facilities that we use to operate our exchanges and clearinghouses, develop our products or provide cloud-based services. Climate related events, including extreme weather events and their impact on the critical infrastructure in the United States and elsewhere, have the potential to disrupt our business or the business of our clients; cause increased volatility in commodity markets in which Nasdaq Clearing operates as a clearinghouse, which may result in Nasdaq Clearing holding insufficient collateral for such volatility; lead to an increase in costs of raw materials, which may adversely affect certain of our listed companies operating in certain sectors and create adverse market conditions, including trading volatility beyond historical levels, any of which could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results.\nAdditionally, if the SEC or other federal regulatory agencies impose comprehensive reporting obligations regarding climate change on public companies, there may be a decrease in new listings or an increase in de-listings of our listed companies, which may adversely affect our business, financial condition and operating results.\nSuch new regulations, whether in the U.S. or in other countries in which we operate, could also cause us to incur additional compliance and reporting costs.\nOur businesses operate in various international markets, including certain emerging markets that are subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than developed countries.\nOur businesses operate in various international markets, including but not limited to Northern Europe, the Baltics, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, and our non-U.S. operations are subject to the risk inherent in the international environment. Political, economic or social events or developments in one or more of our non-U.S. locations could adversely affect our operations and financial results. Some locations, such as Lithuania, India and the Philippines, have economies that may be subject to greater political, economic and social uncertainties than countries with more developed institutional structures, which may increase our operational risk.\nUnforeseen or catastrophic events could interrupt our critical business functions. In addition, our U.S. and European businesses are heavily concentrated in particular areas and may be adversely affected by events in those areas.\nWe may incur losses as a result of unforeseen or catastrophic events, such as terrorist attacks, natural disasters, pandemics (such as COVID-19), extreme weather, fire, power loss, telecommunications failures, human error, theft, sabotage and\nvandalism. Given our position in the global capital markets, we may be more likely than other companies to be a target for malicious disruption activities.\nIn addition, our U.S. and European business operations are heavily concentrated in the U.S. East Coast, and Stockholm, Sweden, respectively. Any event that impacts either of those geographic areas could potentially affect our ability to operate our businesses.\nWe have disaster recovery and business continuity plans and capabilities for critical systems and business functions to mitigate the risk of an interruption. Any interruption in our critical business functions or systems could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results. Additionally, some colocation customers may lack adequate disaster recovery solutions to avoid loss of trade flow from a sustained interruption of our critical systems.\nBecause we have operations in numerous countries, we are exposed to currency risk.\nWe have operations in the U.S., the Nordic and Baltic countries, Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and many other foreign countries. We therefore have significant exposure to exchange rate movements between the Euro, Swedish Krona, the Canadian dollar and other foreign currencies towards the U.S. dollar. Significant inflation or disproportionate changes in foreign exchange rates with respect to one or more of these currencies could occur as a result of general economic conditions, acts of war or terrorism, changes in governmental monetary or tax policy, changes in local interest rates or other factors. These exchange rate differences will affect the translation of our non-U.S. results of operations, interest expense and financial condition into U.S. dollars as part of the preparation of our consolidated financial statements.\nIf our risk management methods are not effective, our business, reputation and financial results may be adversely affected.\nWe utilize widely-accepted methods to identify, assess, monitor and manage our risks, including oversight of risk management, by Nasdaq’s Global Risk Management Committee, which is comprised of senior executives and has the responsibility for regularly reviewing risks and referring significant risks to the board of directors or specific board committees. Local risk management committees in our international offices provide local risk oversight and escalation to local boards, as appropriate. Certain risk management methods require subjective evaluation of dynamic information regarding markets, customers or other matters. That variable information may not in all cases be accurate, complete, up-to-date or properly\nevaluated. If we do not successfully identify, assess, monitor or manage the risks to which we are exposed, our business, reputation, financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected.\n31\nDecisions to declare future dividends on our common stock will be at the discretion of our board of directors and there can be no guarantee that we will pay future dividends to our stockholders.\nOur board of directors regularly declares quarterly cash dividend payments on our outstanding common stock. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by Nasdaq’s board of directors. The board’s determination to declare dividends will depend upon our profitability and financial condition, contractual restrictions, restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors that the board deems relevant. Based on an evaluation of these factors, the board of directors may determine not to declare future dividends at all or to declare future dividends at a reduced amount. Accordingly, there can be no guarantee that we will pay future dividends to our stockholders.\nProvisions of our certificate of incorporation, by-laws, exchange rules (including provisions included to address SEC concerns) and governing law restrict the ownership and voting of our common stock. In addition, such provisions could delay or prevent a change in control of us and entrench current management.\nOur organizational documents place restrictions on the voting rights of certain stockholders. The holders of our common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters to be voted upon by the stockholders except that no person may exercise voting rights in respect of any shares in excess of 5% of the then outstanding shares of our common stock. Any change to the 5% voting limitation would require SEC approval.\nIn response to the SEC’s concern about a concentration of our ownership, the rules of some of our exchange subsidiaries include a prohibition on any member or any person associated with a member of the exchange from beneficially owning more than 20% of our outstanding voting interests. SEC consent would be required before any investor could obtain more than a 20% voting interest in us. The rules of some of our exchange subsidiaries also require the SEC’s approval of any business ventures with exchange members, subject to exceptions.\nOur organizational documents contain provisions that may be deemed to have an anti-takeover effect and may delay, deter or prevent a change of control of us, such as a tender offer or takeover proposal that might result in a premium over the market price for our common stock. Additionally, certain of these provisions make it more difficult to bring about a change in the composition of our board of directors, which could result in entrenchment of current management.\nOur certificate of incorporation and by-laws:\n•\ndo not permit stockholders to act by written consent;\n•\nrequire certain advance notice for director nominations and actions to be taken at annual meetings; and\n•\nauthorize the issuance of undesignated preferred stock, or “blank check” preferred stock, which could be issued by our board of directors without stockholder approval.\nSection 203 of the Delaware General Corporation Law imposes restrictions on mergers and other business combinations between us and any holder of 15% or more (or, in some cases, a holder who previously held 15% or more) of our common stock. In general, Delaware law prohibits a publicly held corporation from engaging in a “business combination” with an “interested stockholder” for three years after the stockholder becomes an interested stockholder, unless the corporation’s board of directors and stockholders approve the business combination in a prescribed manner.\nFinally, many of the European countries where we operate regulated entities require prior governmental approval before an investor acquires 10% or greater of our common stock."

Risk Factors.” For further discussion of our growth strategy, products and services, and competitive strengths, see “Item 1. Business.” Unless stated otherwise, the comparisons presented in this discussion and analysis refer to the year-over-year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. Discussion of fiscal year 2020 items and the year-over year comparison of changes in our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 can be found in Part II, “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, which was previously filed with the SEC on February 23, 2021.\nBusiness Segments\nWe manage, operate and provide our products and services in four business segments: Market Technology, Investment Intelligence, Corporate Platforms and Market Services. See Note 1, “Organization and Nature of Operations,” and Note 19, “Business Segments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our reportable segments and geographic data, as well as how management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as four separate segments. See “Part I, Item 1. Business” for additional discussion on recent developments and highlights.\nFinancial Summary\nThe following table summarizes our financial performance for the year ended December 31, 2021 when compared to the same period in 2020 and for the year ended December 31, 2020 when compared to the same period in 2019. The comparability of our results of operations between reported periods is impacted by the acquisition of Verafin in February 2021 and the divestiture of our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was part of our FICC business within our Market Services segment in June 2021. See “2021 Divestiture,” and “2021 Acquisition,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. For a detailed discussion of our results of operations, see “Segment Operating Results” below.\nIn countries with currencies other than the U.S. dollar, revenues and expenses are translated using monthly average exchange rates. Impacts on our revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating income associated with fluctuations in foreign currency are discussed in more detail under “Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk.”\nNasdaq's Operating Results\nThe following chart summarizes our ARR (in millions):\n35\nARR for a given period is the annualized revenue derived from subscription contracts with a defined contract value. This excludes contracts that are not recurring, are one-time in nature, or where the contract value fluctuates based on defined metrics. ARR is currently one of our key performance metrics to assess the health and trajectory of our recurring business. ARR does not have any standardized definition and is therefore unlikely to be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies. ARR should be viewed independently of revenue and deferred revenue and is not intended to be combined with or to replace either of those items. ARR is not a forecast and the active contracts at the end of a reporting period used in calculating ARR may or may not be extended or renewed by our customers.\nThe ARR chart includes:\nThe following chart summarizes our quarterly annualized SaaS revenues for our Solutions Segments, which is comprised of Market Technology, Investment Intelligence and Corporate Platforms, for the fourth quarter of 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nSegment Operating Results\nThe following table presents our revenues by segment, transaction-based expenses for our Market Services segment and total revenues less transaction-based expenses:\n36\nThe following charts present our Market Technology, Investment Intelligence, Corporate Platforms and Market Services segments as a percentage of our total revenues, less transaction-based expenses, of $3,420 million for the year ended December 31, 2021, $2,903 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $2,535 million for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPercentage of Revenues Less Transaction-based Expenses by Segment for the:\n37\nMARKET TECHNOLOGY\nThe following tables present revenues and key drivers from our Market Technology segment:\nIn the table above, order intake is the total contract value of orders signed during the period, excluding Verafin. ARR and SaaS revenues include Verafin.\nAnti Financial Crime Technology Revenues\nAnti-financial crime technology revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to the inclusion of revenues from our acquisition of Verafin and continued growth in surveillance solutions.\nMarketplace Infrastructure Technology Revenues\nMarketplace infrastructure technology revenues decreased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower professional services revenues reflecting both an elevated prior year comparison period as well as capacity constraints that pandemic-related logistical challenges imposed on installation and change request projects as well as the completion of a significant long-term contract, partially offset by an increase in SaaS revenues.\nINVESTMENT INTELLIGENCE\nThe following tables present revenues and key drivers from our Investment Intelligence segment:\nMarket Data Revenues\nMarket data revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to an increase in proprietary data revenues from new sales primarily outside the U.S., partially offset by lower U.S. shared tape plan revenues.\nIndex Revenues\nIndex revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher licensing revenues from higher average AUM in ETPs linked to Nasdaq indexes and higher licensing revenues from futures trading linked to the Nasdaq-100 Index.\nAnalytics Revenues\nAnalytics revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to the growth in our eVestment and Solovis products driven by new sales, strong retention, and higher average revenue per client from expanded offerings.\nCORPORATE PLATFORMS\nThe following tables present revenues and key drivers from our Corporate Platforms segment:\n38\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe Nasdaq Stock Market new listings include IPOs, including issuers that switched from other listing venues and separately listed ETPs. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, IPOs included 433, 132 and 43 SPACs, respectively.\n•\nExchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic new listings include IPOs and represent companies listed on the Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges and companies on the alternative markets of Nasdaq First North.\n•\nNumber of total listed companies on The Nasdaq Stock Market for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 included 441, 412 and 412 ETPs, respectively.\n•\nNumber of total listed companies on the exchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic represents companies listed on these exchanges and companies on the alternative markets of Nasdaq First North.\nListing Services\nRevenues\nListing services revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to an increase in the overall number of listed companies.\nIR & ESG Services\nRevenues\nIR & ESG Services revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher adoption of our investor relations intelligence products as well as new ESG solutions.\nMARKET SERVICES\nEquity Derivative Trading and Clearing Revenues\nThe following tables present total revenues, transaction-based expenses, and total revenues less transaction-based expenses as well as key drivers from our Equity Derivative Trading and Clearing business:\nIn the table above, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees includes Section 31 fees of $32 million in\n2021\n, $69 million in 2020 and $43 million in 2019. Section 31 fees are recorded as equity derivative trading and clearing revenues with a corresponding amount recorded in transaction-based expenses.\n39\nIn the table above, Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic total average daily volume of options and futures contracts include Finnish option contracts traded on Eurex for which Nasdaq and Eurex have a revenue sharing arrangement.\nEquity derivative trading and clearing revenues and equity derivative trading and clearing revenues less transaction-based expenses increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher U.S. industry trading volumes, partially offset by lower overall U.S. matched market share executed on Nasdaq's exchanges and a lower capture rate. Also partially offsetting the increase in equity derivative trading and clearing revenues was\nlower Section 31 pass-through fee revenue.\nSection 31 fees are recorded as equity derivative trading and clearing revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as brokerage, clearance and exchange fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. In the U.S., we are assessed these fees from the SEC and pass them through to our customers in the form of incremental fees. Pass-through fees can increase or decrease due to rate changes by the SEC, our percentage of the overall industry volumes processed on our systems, and differences in actual dollar value of shares traded. Since the amount recorded in revenues is equal to the amount recorded as brokerage, clearance and exchange fees, there is no impact on our revenues less transaction-based expenses. Section 31 fees decreased in 2021 compared with 2020 due to\nlower average SEC fee rates, partially offset by higher dollar value traded on Nasdaq's exchanges.\nTransaction rebates, in which we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant, increased in 2021 compared with 2020. The increase in 2021 was primarily due to higher U.S. industry trading volumes, partially offset by lower overall U.S. matched market share executed on Nasdaq's exchanges and a lower rebate capture rate.\nCash Equity Trading Revenues\nThe following tables present total revenues, transaction-based expenses, and total revenues less transaction-based expenses as well as key drivers and other metrics from our Cash Equity Trading business:\nIn the table above, brokerage, clearance and exchange fees includes Section 31 fees of\n$228 million in 2021, $586 million in 2020 and $337 million in 2019. Section 31 fees are recorded as cash equity trading revenues with a corresponding amount recorded in transaction-based expenses.\n40\nIn the table above, total market shares includes transactions executed on The Nasdaq Stock Market’s, Nasdaq BX’s and Nasdaq PSX’s systems plus trades reported through the FINRA/Nasdaq Trade Reporting Facility.\nCash equity trading revenues decreased in 2021 compared with 2020\nprimarily due to lower Section 31 pass-through fee revenue and lower overall U.S. matched market share executed on Nasdaq's exchanges, partially offset by higher U.S. industry trading volumes,\nhigher U.S. gross capture rates, higher European value traded and a favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates.\nCash equity trading revenues less transaction-based expenses increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher\nU.S. net capture rates, higher U.S. industry trading volumes, higher European value traded and a favorable impact from changes in foreign exchange rates, p\nartially offset by lower overall U.S. matched market share executed on Nasdaq's exchanges.\nSimilar to equity derivative trading and clearing, in the U.S. we record Section 31 fees as cash equity trading revenues with a corresponding amount recorded as brokerage, clearance and exchange fees in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We are assessed these fees from the SEC and pass them through to our customers in the form of incremental fees. Since the amount recorded as revenues is equal to the amount recorded as brokerage, clearance and exchange fees, there is no impact on our revenues less transaction-based expenses. Section 31 fees decreased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to lower average SEC fee rates.\nTransaction rebates decreased 2021 compared with 2020. For The Nasdaq Stock Market and Nasdaq PSX, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity, and for Nasdaq BX, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that takes the liquidity. The decrease\nwas\nprimarily due to lower overall U.S. matched market share executed on Nasdaq's exchanges and a lower rebate capture rate, partially offset by\nhigher U.S. industry\ntrading volumes.\nFICC Revenues\nThe following table present revenues from our FICC business:\nFICC revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to higher European products revenues and a positive impact from foreign exchange rates.\nTrade Management Services Revenues\nThe following tables present revenues and key drivers from our Trade Management Services business:\nTrade management services revenues increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to increased demand for connectivity and infrastructure services.\nOTHER REVENUES\nOther revenues include the revenues associated with our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was sold in June 2021. Prior to the sale date, these revenues were included in our Market Services and Investment Intelligence segments. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4,“Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this divestiture. Additionally, other revenues include revenues associated with the NPM business which we contributed in July 2021 to a standalone, independent company, of which we own the largest minority interest, together with a consortium of third party financial institutions. Prior to July 2021, these revenues were included in our Corporate Platforms segment.\n41\nEXPENSES\nOperating Expenses\nThe following tables present our operating expenses:\nThe increase in compensation and benefits expense in 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily driven by higher performance-linked compensation expense, our continued investment to drive growth, an increase in headcount as a result of our acquisition of Verafin and an unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates.\nHeadcount increased to 5,814 employees as of December 31, 2021 from 4,830 as of December 31, 2020 primarily due to our recent acquisition of Verafin.\nProfessional and contract services expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to an increase in consulting costs.\nComputer operations and data communications expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to our acquisition of Verafin and higher hardware and software maintenance costs due to increased cloud storage costs.\nOccupancy expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 due to our acquisition of Verafin and higher data center costs.\nGeneral, administrative and other expense decreased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to charitable donations made to the Nasdaq Foundation, COVID-19 response and relief efforts and social justice charities in 2020, and a reserve recorded for a loss on a Market Technology implementation project in 2020.\nMarketing and advertising expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to an increase in marketing commitments primarily driven by the increase in new listings.\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to additional expense for acquired intangible assets related to our acquisition of Verafin.\nRegulatory expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to a charge associated with an administrative fine issued by the SFSA. See “Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default,” of Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the SFSA administrative fine.\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to the acquisition of Verafin. We have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and\ndivestitures i\nn recent years, which have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs and will vary based on the size and frequency of the activities described above.\nSee Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our 2019 restructuring plan and charges associated with this plan.\nNon-operating Income and Expenses\nThe following table presents our non-operating income and expenses:\n____________\nN/M\nNot meaningful.\nInterest income decreased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to a decrease in interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalents balance.\n42\nThe following table presents our interest expense:\nInterest expense increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to new issuances of senior notes in December 2020 and commercial paper issuances in the first quarter of 2021 to fund our acquisition of Verafin. See “2021 Acquisition,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the acquisition of Verafin. See Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nThe net gain on divestiture of businesses in 2021 relates to the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was part of our FICC business within our Market Services segment. We recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $84 million, net of disposal costs. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nOther income increased in 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to gains from sales of strategic investments entered into through our corporate venture program.\nNet income from unconsolidated investees decreased in the 2021 compared with 2020 primarily due to a decrease in income recognized from our equity method investment in OCC. See “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nTax Matters\nThe following table presents our income tax provision and effective tax rate:\nFor further discussion of our tax matters, see Note 17, “Income Taxes,” to the consolidated financial statements.\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\nIn addition to disclosing results determined in accordance with U.S. GAAP, we have also provided non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share. Management uses this non-GAAP information internally, along with U.S. GAAP information, in evaluating our performance and in making financial and operational decisions. We believe our presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and supplemental data relating to our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, we believe the presentation of these measures is useful to investors for period-to-period comparisons of our ongoing operating performance.\nThese measures are not in accordance with, or an alternative to, U.S. GAAP, and may be different from non-GAAP measures used by other companies. In addition, other companies, including companies in our industry, may calculate such measures differently, which reduces their usefulness as comparative measures. Investors should not rely on any single financial measure when evaluating our business. This non-GAAP information should be considered as supplemental in nature and is not meant as a substitute for our operating results in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We recommend investors review the U.S. GAAP financial measures included in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto. When viewed in conjunction with our U.S. GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, we believe these non-GAAP measures provide greater transparency and a more complete understanding of factors affecting our business than U.S. GAAP measures alone.\nWe understand that analysts and investors regularly rely on non-GAAP financial measures, such as non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share, to assess operating performance. We use non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share because they highlight trends more clearly in our business that may not otherwise be apparent when relying solely on U.S. GAAP financial measures, since these measures eliminate from our results specific financial items that have less bearing on our ongoing operating performance. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq for the periods presented below is calculated by adjusting for the following items:\n•\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets:\nWe amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the businesses, the relative operating performance of the businesses between periods, and the earnings power of Nasdaq. Performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense therefore provide investors with a\n43\nuseful representation of our businesses’ ongoing activity in each period.\n•\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense:\nWe have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Accordingly, we exclude these costs for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures, which provide a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods.\n•\nRestructuring charges:\nWe initiated the transition of certain technology platforms to advance our strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continue the re-alignment of certain business areas. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our 2019 restructuring plan, which was completed in June 2021. Charges associated with this plan represented a fundamental shift in our strategy and technology as well as executive re-alignment and were excluded for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures as they are not reflective of ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq's performance between periods.\n•\nNet income from unconsolidated investee:\nSee “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Our income on our investment in OCC may vary significantly compared to prior periods due to the changes in OCC's capital management policy. Accordingly, we will exclude this income from current and prior periods for purposes of calculating non-GAAP measures which provide a more meaningful analysis of Nasdaq’s ongoing operating performance or comparisons in Nasdaq’s performance between periods.\n•\nOther significant items:\nWe have excluded certain other charges or gains, including certain tax items, that are the result of other non-comparable events to measure operating performance. We believe the exclusion of such amounts allows management and investors to better understand the ongoing financial results of Nasdaq. Other significant items include:\n•\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 a charge related to an administrative fine imposed by the SFSA associated with the default that occurred in 2018, see “Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default,” of Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion, and for the year ended December 31, 2020, the reversal of a $6 million regulatory fine issued by the SFSA. Both charges have been included in regulatory expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income;\n•\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020, a provision for notes receivable associated with the funding of technology development for the CAT included in general, administrative and other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income;\n•\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, a charge on extinguishment of debt which is included in general, administrative and other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income;\n•\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021, a net gain on divestiture of business, which represents our pre-tax net gain of $84 million on the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business;\n•\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020, charitable donations made to the Nasdaq Foundation, COVID-19 response and relief efforts, and social justice charities included in general, administrative and other expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income; and\n•\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 gains from strategic investments entered into through our corporate venture program included in other income in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\n•\nSignificant tax items:\nThe non-GAAP adjustment to the income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 includes the tax impact of each non-GAAP adjustment. In addition, for year ended December 31, 2021, the non-GAAP adjustment to the income tax provision includes return-to-provision adjustments and prior period tax benefits and for the year ended December 31, 2020, a tax benefit on compensation related deductions determined to be allowable and excess tax benefit related to employee share-based compensation to reflect the recognition of the income tax effects of share-based awards when awards vest or are settled. Beginning with the quarter ended March 31, 2021, such excess tax benefits are no longer included as a non-GAAP adjustment as they do not have a material impact on period over period comparison.\n44\nThe following table presents reconciliations between U.S. GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and diluted earnings per share and non-GAAP net income attributable to Nasdaq and diluted earnings per share:\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nHistorically, we have funded our operating activities and met our commitments through cash generated by operations, augmented by the periodic issuance of our common stock and debt. Currently, our cost and availability of funding remain healthy.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our sources and uses of cash were not materially impacted by COVID-19 and we have not identified any liquidity deficiencies as a result of the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nWe will continue to closely monitor and manage our liquidity and capital resources. In addition, we continue to prudently assess our capital deployment strategy through balancing acquisitions, internal investments, debt repayments, and shareholder return activity, including share repurchases and dividends.\nIn the near term, we expect that our operations and the availability under our revolving credit facility and commercial paper program will provide sufficient cash to fund our operating expenses, capital expenditures, debt repayments, any share repurchases, and any dividends.\nIn April 2021, we filed a universal shelf registration statement on Form S-3ASR (Automatic Shelf Registration) with the SEC to have the ability to sell various types of securities including debt securities, common stock, preferred stock, depository receipts, warrants, subscription rights, purchase contracts and purchase units. The specific terms of any securities to be sold will be described in supplemental filings with the SEC. The registration statement will expire in April 2024\n.\nIn July 2021, we issued the 2033 Notes and primarily used the net proceeds from the sale of the 2033 Notes to redeem the 2023 Notes. See “2033 Notes,” and “Early Extinguishment of 2023 Notes,” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\nThe value of various assets and liabilities, including cash and cash equivalents, receivables, accounts payable and accrued expenses, the current portion of long-term debt, and commercial paper, can fluctuate from month to month. Working capital (calculated as current assets less current liabilities) was $(449) million as of December 31, 2021, compared with $2,736 million as of December 31, 2020, a decrease of $3,185 million. The decrease was primarily due to a decrease in cash and cash equivalents, mainly due to the utilization of cash to partially fund the acquisition of Verafin, increases in short-term debt and deferred revenue, partially offset by a decrease in Section 31 fees payable and an increase in other current assets.\nPrincipal factors that could affect the availability of our internally-generated funds include:\n•    deterioration of our revenues in any of our business segments;\n45\n•    changes in regulatory and working capital requirements; and\n•\nan increase in our expenses.\nPrincipal factors that could affect our ability to obtain cash from external sources include:\n•    operating covenants contained in our credit facilities that limit our total borrowing capacity;\n•    credit rating downgrades, which could limit our access to additional debt;\n•    a significant decrease in the market price of our common stock;\n•    volatility or disruption in the public debt and equity markets; and\n•    the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business.\nThe following sections discuss the effects of changes in our financial assets, debt obligations, regulatory capital requirements, and cash flows on our liquidity and capital resources.\nFinancial Assets\nThe following table summarizes our financial assets:\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents includes all non-restricted cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. The balance retained in cash and cash equivalents is a function of anticipated or possible short-term cash needs, prevailing interest rates, our investment policy, and alternative investment choices. As of December 31, 2021, our cash and cash equivalents of $393 million were primarily invested in bank deposits and money market funds. In the long-term, we may use both internally generated funds and external sources to satisfy our debt obligations and other long-term liabilities. Cash and cash equivalents as of December 31, 2021 decreased $2,352 million from December 31, 2020, primarily due to:\n•\nour acquisition of Verafin, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired;\n•\nrepayment of borrowings under our credit commitment and debt obligations;\n•\nthe ASR agreement;\n•\nother repurchases of our common stock;\n•\ncash dividends paid on our common stock;\n•\npurchases of property and equipment;\n•\nother investing activities;\n•\npayments related to employee shares withheld for taxes;\n•\npayment of debt extinguishment cost, partially offset by;\n•\nnet cash provided by operating activities;\n•\nproceeds from issuances of long-term debt, net of issuance costs and utilization of credit commitment;\n•\nproceeds from commercial paper, net; and\n•\nproceeds from divestiture of businesses, net of cash divested.\nSee “Cash Flow Analysis” below for further discussion.\nRepatriation of Cash\nOur cash and cash equivalents held outside of the U.S. in various foreign subsidiaries totaled $266 million as of December 31, 2021 and $237 million as of December 31, 2020. The remaining balance held in the U.S. totaled $127 million as of December 31, 2021 and $2,508 million as of December 31, 2020.\nUnremitted earnings of certain subsidiaries outside of the U.S. are used to finance our international operations and are considered to be indefinitely reinvested.\nShare Repurchase Program\nSee “Share Repurchase Program,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our share repurchase program.\nASR Agreements\nSee “ASR Agreements,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our ASR agreements.\nCash Dividends on Common Stock\nThe following table presents our quarterly cash dividends paid per common share on our outstanding common stock:\nSee “Cash Dividends on Common Stock,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the dividends.\nFinancial Investments\nOur financial investments totaled $208 million as of December 31, 2021 and $195 million as of December 31, 2020. Of these securities, $162 million as of December 31, 2021 and $175 million as of December 31, 2020 are assets primarily utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements, mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing. See Note 6, “Investments,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n46\nDebt Obligations\nThe following table summarizes our debt obligations by contractual maturity:\nIn the table above, the 2022 Notes were reclassified to short-term debt as of December 31, 2021.\nIn addition to the $1.25 billion revolving credit facility, we also have other credit facilities primarily to support our Nasdaq Clearing operations in Europe, as well as to provide a cash pool credit line for one subsidiary. These credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, totaled\n$212 million\nas of December 31, 2021 and $232 million as of December 31, 2020 in available liquidity\n, none\nof which was utilized.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.\nSee Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nRegulatory Capital Requirements\nClearing Operations Regulatory Capital Requirements\nWe are required to maintain minimum levels of regulatory capital for the clearing operations of Nasdaq Clearing. The level of regulatory capital required to be maintained is dependent upon many factors, including market conditions and creditworthiness of the counterparty. As of December 31, 2021, our required regulatory capital of $138 million was comprised of highly rated European government debt securities that are included in financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nBroker-Dealer Net Capital Requirements\nOur broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, NFSTX, LLC, and Nasdaq Capital Markets Advisory, are subject to regulatory requirements intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity. These requirements obligate these subsidiaries to comply with minimum net capital requirements. As of December 31, 2021, the combined required minimum net capital totaled $1 million and the combined excess capital totaled $21 million, substantially all of which is held in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The required minimum net capital is included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nNordic and Baltic Exchange Regulatory Capital Requirements\nThe entities that operate trading venues in the Nordic and Baltic countries are each subject to local regulations and are required to maintain regulatory capital intended to ensure their general financial soundness and liquidity. As of December 31, 2021, our required regulatory capital of $35 million was primarily invested in European government debt securities that are included in financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and cash, which is included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOther Capital Requirements\nWe operate several other businesses, which are subject to local regulation and are required to maintain certain levels of regulatory capital. As of December 31, 2021, other required regulatory capital was $8 million and was primarily included in restricted cash in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\n47\nCash Flow Analysis\nThe following table summarizes the changes in cash flows:\nWe have adjusted prior period presentation of opening and ending amounts of cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash and cash equivalents in our consolidated statements of cash flows to include restricted cash and cash equivalents related to the default funds and margin deposits. See Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this adjustment.\nNet Cash Provided by Operating Activities\nNet cash provided by operating activities primarily consists of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items such as: depreciation and amortization expense of property and equipment; amortization expense of acquired finite-lived intangible assets; expense associated with share-based compensation; deferred income taxes; debt extinguishment costs; net gain on divestiture of a business, and net income from unconsolidated investees.\nNet cash provided by operating activities is also impacted by the effects of changes in operating assets and liabilities such as: accounts receivable and deferred revenue which are impacted by the timing of customer billings and related collections from our customers; accounts payable and accrued expenses due to timing of payments; accrued personnel costs, which are impacted by employee performance targets and the timing of payments related to employee bonus incentives; and Section 31 fees payable to the SEC, which is impacted by the timing of collections from customers and payments to the SEC.\nNet cash provided by operating activities decreased $169 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with 2020. The decrease was primarily driven by a cash payment of an acquisition-related tax obligation on behalf of Verafin of $221 million and a cash payment of $102 million, the release of which is subject to certain employment-related conditions over three years following the closing of the acquisition of Verafin, partially offset by higher net income. The remaining change was primarily due to other fluctuations in our working capital.\nNet Cash Used in Investing Activities\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to $2,430 million of cash used for the acquisition of Verafin, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired of $221 million, which was utilized to satisfy an acquisition-related tax obligation on behalf of Verafin, $163 million of purchases of property and equipment, a net decrease in investments related to default funds and margin deposits $132 million, $31 million of net purchases of securities and other investing activities of $87 million, partially offset by proceeds from divestiture of businesses, net of cash divested $190 million.\nNet cash used in investing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to $157 million of cash used for acquisitions, net of cash and cash equivalents acquired and $188 million of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset by $119 million of proceeds from the net sales of securities and a net increase in investments related to default funds and margin deposits of $109 million.\nNet Cash Provided by (Used in) Financing Activities\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily related to a net increase in default funds and margin deposits of $2,330 million, proceeds of $826 million from the issuances of long-term-debt and utilization of credit commitment and $420 million of proceeds from issuances of commercial paper, net, partially offset by repayment of borrowings under our credit commitment and debt obligations of $804 million, $475 million of repurchases of common stock pursuant to the ASR agreement, $468 million in other repurchases of common stock, $350 million of dividend payments to our shareholders and a $33 million payment for debt extinguishment costs.\nNet cash provided by financing activities for the year ended December 31, 2020 primarily related to $3,807 million of proceeds from issuances of long-term debt and the utilization of our credit commitment and a net increase in default funds and margin deposits $527 million, partially offset by $1,468 million in repayments of borrowings under our credit commitment and debt obligations, $222 million in repurchases of common stock, $391 million of net repayments of commercial paper, $320 million of dividend payments to our shareholders and a $36 million payment for debt extinguishment costs.\n48\nSee Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our acquisitions and divestiture.\nSee Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our debt obligations.\nSee “ASR Agreements,” “Share Repurchase Program,” and “Cash Dividends on Common Stock,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our ASR agreement, share repurchase program and cash dividends paid on our common stock.\nContractual Obligations and Contingent Commitments\nNasdaq has contractual obligations to make future payments under debt obligations by contract maturity, operating lease payments, and other obligations. The following table summarizes material cash requirements for known contractual and other obligations as of December 31, 2021, and the estimated timing thereof.\nIn the table above:\n•\nDebt obligations by contractual maturity include both principal and interest obligations. As of December 31, 2021, an interest rate of 2.4% was used to compute the amount of the contractual obligations for interest on the 2020 Credit Facility. All other debt obligations were primarily calculated on a 365-day basis at the contractual fixed rate multiplied by the aggregate principal amount as of December 31, 2021. See Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.\n•\nOperating lease obligations represent our undiscounted operating lease liabilities as of December 31, 2021. See Note 16, “Leases,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our leases.\n•\nPurchase obligations primarily represent minimum outstanding obligations due under software license agreements. The balance as of December 31, 2021 is primarily comprised of our multi-year AWS partnership contract, which replaces our previous shorter term contracts, including those with no minimum spend commitment, and is not expected to increase our overall spend footprint with AWS over the life of the contract, based on projected growth and expansion of our existing AWS-based solutions.\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nFor discussion of off-balance sheet arrangements see:\n•    Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our non-cash default fund contributions and margin deposits received for clearing operations; and\n•    Note 18, “Commitments, Contingencies and Guarantees,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of:\n◦\nGuarantees issued and credit facilities available;\n◦\nOther guarantees;\n◦\nRouting brokerage activities;\n◦\nLegal and regulatory matters; and\n◦\nTax audits.\nQuantitative And Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\nAs a result of our operating, investing and financing activities, we are exposed to market risks such as interest rate risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk. We are also exposed to credit risk as a result of our normal business activities.\nWe have implemented policies and procedures to measure, manage, monitor and report risk exposures, which are reviewed regularly by management and the board of directors. We identify risk exposures and monitor and manage such risks on a daily basis.\nWe perform sensitivity analyses to determine the effects of market risk exposures. We may use derivative instruments solely to hedge financial risks related to our financial positions or risks that are incurred during the normal course of business. We do not use derivative instruments for speculative purposes.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe are subject to the risk of fluctuating interest rates in the normal course of business. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our financial investments and debt obligations, which are discussed below.\nFinancial Investments\nAs of December 31, 2021, our investment portfolio was primarily comprised of highly rated European government debt securities, which pay a fixed rate of interest. These securities are subject to interest rate risk and the fair value of these securities will decrease if market interest rates increase. If market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by a hypothetical 100 basis points from levels as of December 31, 2021, the fair value of this portfolio would have declined by $5 million.\n49\nDebt Obligations\nAs of December 31, 2021, the majority of our debt obligations were fixed-rate obligations. Interest rates on certain tranches of notes are subject to adjustment to the extent our debt rating is downgraded below investment grade, as further discussed in Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” to the consolidated financial statements. While changes in interest rates will have no impact on the interest we pay on fixed-rate obligations, we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the amounts outstanding from the sale of commercial paper, which have variable interest rates and any borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility, as the interest rate on this facility has a variable interest rate. As of December 31, 2021, we had principal amounts outstanding of $420 million of commercial paper and no amounts outstanding under our 2020 Credit Facility. A hypothetical 100 basis points increase in interest rates on our outstanding commercial paper would increase annual interest expense by approximately $4 million based on borrowings as of December 31, 2021.\nWe may utilize interest rate swap agreements to achieve a desired mix of variable and fixed rate debt.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our primary transactional exposure to foreign currency denominated revenues less transaction-based expenses and operating income for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 are presented in the following tables:\n____________\n#    Represents multiple foreign currency rates.\nN/A    Not applicable.\n50\nOur investments in foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in currency exchange rates through translation of the foreign subsidiaries’ net assets or equity to U.S. dollars. Substantially all of our foreign subsidiaries operate in functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars for consolidated reporting using a current rate of exchange, with net gains or losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nOur primary exposure to net assets in foreign currencies as of December 31, 2021 is presented in the following table:\nIn the table above, Swedish Krona includes goodwill of $2,484 million and intangible assets, net of $589 million.\nCredit Risk\nCredit risk is the potential loss due to the default or deterioration in credit quality of customers or counterparties. We are exposed to credit risk from third parties, including customers, counterparties and clearing agents. These parties may default on their obligations to us due to bankruptcy, lack of liquidity, operational failure or other reasons. We limit our exposure to credit risk by evaluating the counterparties with which we make investments and execute agreements. For our investment portfolio, our objective is to invest in securities to preserve principal while maximizing yields, without significantly increasing risk. Credit risk associated with investments is minimized substantially by ensuring that these financial assets are placed with governments which have investment grade ratings, well-capitalized financial institutions and other creditworthy counterparties.\nOur subsidiary, Nasdaq Execution Services, may be exposed to credit risk due to the default of trading counterparties in connection with the routing services it provides for our trading customers. System trades in cash equities routed to other market centers for members of our cash equity exchanges are routed by Nasdaq Execution Services for clearing to the NSCC. In this function, Nasdaq Execution Services is to be neutral by the end of the trading day, but may be exposed to intraday risk if a trade extends beyond the trading day and into the next day, thereby leaving Nasdaq Execution Services susceptible to counterparty risk in the period between accepting the trade and routing it to the clearinghouse. In this interim period, Nasdaq Execution Services is not novating like a clearing broker but instead is subject to the short-term risk of counterparty failure before\nthe clearinghouse enters the transaction. Once the clearinghouse officially accepts the trade for novation, Nasdaq Execution Services is legally removed from trade execution risk. However, Nasdaq has membership obligations to NSCC independent of Nasdaq Execution Services’ arrangements.\nPursuant to the rules of the NSCC and Nasdaq Execution Services’ clearing agreement, Nasdaq Execution Services is liable for any losses incurred due to a counterparty or a clearing agent’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations, either by making payment or delivering securities. Adverse movements in the prices of securities that are subject to these transactions can increase our credit risk. However, we believe that the risk of material loss is limited, as Nasdaq Execution Services’ customers are not permitted to trade on margin and NSCC rules limit counterparty risk on self-cleared transactions by establishing credit limits and capital deposit requirements for all brokers that clear with NSCC. Historically, Nasdaq Execution Services has never incurred a liability due to a customer’s failure to satisfy its contractual obligations as counterparty to a system trade. Credit difficulties or insolvency, or the perceived possibility of credit difficulties or insolvency, of one or more larger or visible market participants could also result in market-wide credit difficulties or other market disruptions.\nWe have credit risk related to transaction and subscription-based revenues that are billed to customers on a monthly or quarterly basis, in arrears. Our potential exposure to credit losses on these transactions is represented by the receivable balances in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We review and evaluate changes in the status of our counterparties’ creditworthiness. Credit losses such as those described above could adversely affect our consolidated financial position and results of operations.\nWe also are exposed to credit risk through our clearing operations with Nasdaq Clearing. See Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion. Our clearinghouse holds material amounts of clearing member cash deposits, which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits. As the clearinghouse may pass on interest revenues (minus costs) to the members, this could include negative or reduced yield due to market conditions. The following is a summary of the risks associated with these deposits and how these risks are mitigated.\n•\nCredit Risk.\nWhen the clearinghouse has the ability to hold cash collateral at a central bank, the clearinghouse utilizes its access to the central bank system to minimize credit risk exposures. When funds are not held at a central bank, we seek to substantially mitigate credit risk by ensuring that investments are primarily placed in large, highly rated financial institutions, highly rated government debt instruments and other creditworthy counterparties.\n51\n•\nLiquidity Risk.\nLiquidity risk is the risk a clearinghouse may not be able to meet its payment obligations in the right currency, in the right place and the right time. To mitigate this risk, the clearinghouse monitors liquidity requirements closely and maintains funds and assets in a manner which minimizes the risk of loss or delay in the access by the clearinghouse to such funds and assets. For example, holding funds with a central bank where possible or investing in highly liquid government debt instruments serves to reduce liquidity risks.\n•\nInterest Rate Risk.\nInterest rate risk is the risk that interest rates rise causing the value of purchased securities to decline. If we were required to sell securities prior to maturity, and interest rates had risen, the sale of the securities might be made at a loss relative to the latest market price. Our clearinghouse seeks to manage this risk by making short term investments of members' cash deposits. In addition, the clearinghouse investment guidelines allow for direct purchases or repurchase agreements with short dated maturities of high quality sovereign debt (for example, European government and U.S. Treasury securities), central bank certificates and multilateral development bank debt instruments.\n•\nSecurity Issuer Risk.\nSecurity issuer risk is the risk that an issuer of a security defaults on its payment when the security matures. This risk is mitigated by limiting allowable investments and collateral under reverse repurchase agreements to high quality sovereign, government agency or multilateral development bank debt instruments.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions, and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. The accounting policies described below are significantly affected by critical accounting estimates. Such accounting policies require significant judgments, assumptions, and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, and actual results could differ materially from the amounts reported based on these policies\n.\nRevenue Recognition\nMarket Technology Revenues\nWithin our market infrastructure technology business, we enter into long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers which results in these contracts containing multiple performance obligations. We allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominantly through an expected cost plus a margin approach.\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer.\nAccounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity, the complexity of work performed, and logistical challenges due to the effects of COVID-19. Revenue and cost estimates for our long-term contracts are reviewed and reassessed at least quarterly. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nDue to the significance of judgment in the estimation process, as discussed above, changes in assumptions and estimates may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods.\nFor further discussion related to recognition of these revenues, see “Revenue From Contracts with Customers - Revenue Recognition - Market Technology,” of Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements.\n52\nGoodwill, Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets and Related Impairment\nAssets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with our acquisitions are recorded at their estimated fair values. Goodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, technology, exchange and clearing registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually as of October 1 and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. We perform our goodwill impairment test at the reporting unit level for our five reporting units: Market Services segment, the two businesses comprising the Corporate Platforms segment: Listing Services and IR & ESG Services, the Investment Intelligence segment, and the Market Technology segment. When testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their respective carrying amounts as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit or the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective estimated fair values, a quantitative test is required. Our decision to perform a qualitative impairment assessment in a given year is influenced by a number of factors, including but not limited to, the size of the reporting unit’s goodwill, the significance of the excess of the reporting unit’s estimated fair value or the indefinite-lived intangible asset’s fair value over their respective carrying amounts at the last quantitative assessment date, and the amount of time in between quantitative fair value assessments.\nIn performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset with their respective carrying amounts. The fair value of each reporting unit is estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow valuation, which incorporates assumptions regarding future growth rates, terminal values, and discount rates, as well as guideline public company valuations, incorporating relevant trading multiples of comparable companies and other factors. The estimates and assumptions used consider historical performance and are consistent with the assumptions used in determining future profit plans for each reporting unit, which are approved by our board of directors. The fair value of indefinite-lived intangible assets is primarily determined on the basis of estimated discounted value, using the Greenfield Approach for exchange and clearing registrations and licenses, and the relief from royalty approach or excess earnings approach for trade names, both of which incorporate assumptions regarding future revenue projections and discount rates. If the carrying amounts of the reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or the total carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nThe following table presents the balances of goodwill for our reportable segments at the time of our 2021 annual impairment test:\nIn 2021 and 2020, we have elected to perform a quantitative impairment test for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets. In conducting the quantitative assessment, we determined that the fair value of our goodwill for each of our reporting units and the fair value of our indefinite-lived intangible assets sufficiently exceed their respective carrying amounts. As a result, there were no goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets impairment charges recorded in 2021 or 2020. In 2019, we performed a qualitative assessment and no impairment was recorded.\nAlthough we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable, the determination of certain valuation inputs is subject to management’s judgment. Changes in these inputs could materially affect the results of our impairment review. If our forecasts of cash flows or other key inputs are negatively revised in the future, the estimated fair value of each reporting unit and of our indefinite-lived intangible assets would be adversely impacted, potentially leading to an impairment in the future that could materially affect our operating results.\n53\nSubsequent to our annual impairment test, no indications of impairment were identified\n.\nOther Long-Lived Assets and Related Impairment\nWe review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets, equity method investments, equity securities, property and equipment, and operating lease assets for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. We evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary declines in value by considering a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. In addition, for investments where the market value is readily determinable, we consider the underlying stock price as an additional factor. For equity securities, when assessing investments in private companies for impairment, we consider such factors as, among others, the share price from the investee's latest financing round, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets, the investee's liquidity and cash position, and general market conditions. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.\nWe recorded an impairment charge of $14 million in 2021 related to a finite-lived intangible asset for customer relationships associated with the wind down of a previous acquisition included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were no material finite-lived impairment charges in 2020 and 2019.\nWe recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges of $4 million in 2021, $14 million in 2020 and $26 million in 2019. The asset impairment charges in 2020 and 2019 primarily related to capitalized software that was retired and are included in restructuring charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income for 2021, 2020 and 2019. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our 2019 restructuring plan.\nNo material impairments were recorded to reduce the carrying value of our other long-lived assets during 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nEstimates and judgments are required in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of certain deferred tax assets, which arise from net operating loss carryforwards, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense. Our deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the recorded deferred tax assets will not be realized in future periods. Management is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nIn assessing the need for a valuation allowance, we consider all available evidence including past operating results, the existence of cumulative losses in the most recent fiscal years, estimates of future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning strategies. In the event that we change our determination as to the amount of deferred tax assets that can be realized, we will adjust our valuation allowance with a corresponding impact to the provision for income taxes in the period in which such determination is made.\nIn addition, the calculation of our tax liabilities involves uncertainties in the application of tax regulations in the U.S. and other tax jurisdictions. We recognize potential liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in such jurisdictions based on our estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes and interest may be due. While we believe that our tax liabilities reflect the probable outcome of identified tax uncertainties, it is reasonably possible that the ultimate resolution of any tax matter may be greater or less than the amount accrued. If events occur and the payment of these amounts ultimately proves unnecessary, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when we determine the liabilities are no longer necessary. If our estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, a further charge to expense would result.\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements Not Yet Adopted\nWe have considered all recent accounting pronouncements and have concluded that no accounting pronouncements that have not yet been adopted would have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations. See “Recent Accounting Pronouncements,” of Note 2, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of recently adopted and recently issued accounting pronouncements that are applicable to Nasdaq.\n54"

Based upon that evaluation, Nasdaq’s President and Chief Executive Officer and Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, have concluded that, as of the end of such period, Nasdaq’s disclosure controls and procedures are effective.\nChanges in internal control over financial reporting\n. There have been no changes in Nasdaq’s internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) and Rule 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) that occurred during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, Nasdaq’s internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for the preparation and integrity of the consolidated financial statements appearing in the reports that we file with the SEC. The consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles and include amounts based on management’s estimates and judgments.\nManagement is also responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over Nasdaq’s financial reporting. Although there are inherent limitations in the effectiveness of any system of internal control over financial reporting, we maintain a system of internal control that is designed to provide reasonable assurance as to the fair and reliable preparation and presentation of the consolidated financial statements, as well as to safeguard assets from unauthorized use or disposition that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nOur management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) (2013 framework). This evaluation included review of the documentation of controls, evaluation of the design effectiveness of controls, testing of the operating effectiveness of controls and a conclusion on this evaluation. Based on its assessment, our management believes that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting is effective.\nErnst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, has issued an attestation report on Nasdaq’s internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\n55\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nasdaq, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Nasdaq, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Nasdaq, Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23, 2022\n56"

(the Company) as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework), and our report dated February 23, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nF-2\nF-3\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1986.\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 23, 2022\nF-4\nNasdaq, Inc.\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n(in millions, except share and par value amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-5\nNasdaq,\nInc.\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n(in millions, except per share amounts)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-6\nNasdaq,\nInc.\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\n(in millions)\n____________\n(1)\nPrimarily relates to the tax effect of unrealized gains and losses on Euro denominated notes.\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\nF-7\nNasdaq, Inc.\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Stockholders' Equity\n(in millions)\n____________\n(1)\nSee “ASR Agreements,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders’ Equity,” for further discussion.\n(2)\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021 primarily relates to the tax impact of shares accelerated and issued upon the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business.

The platforms allow the routing and execution of buy and sell orders as well as the reporting of transactions, providing fee-based revenues.\n2.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Presentation and Principles of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S. GAAP and include the accounts of Nasdaq, its wholly-owned subsidiaries and other entities in which Nasdaq has a controlling financial interest. When we do not have a controlling interest in an entity but exercise significant influence over the entity’s operating and financial policies, such investment is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We recognize our share of earnings or losses of an equity method investee based on our ownership percentage.\nSee “Equity Method Investments,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion of our equity method investments.\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments which are, in the opinion of management, necessary for a fair statement of the results. These adjustments are of a normal recurring nature. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCertain prior year amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, we adjusted the presentation of cash and cash equivalents held within default funds and margin deposits on the consolidated statement of cash flows from operating activities, to present them as restricted cash and cash equivalents with the associated changes being included within cash flows from investing and financing activities. These balances cannot be used to satisfy the Company's operating or other liabilities. See Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” for further discussion of the default funds and margin deposits.\nPrior period amounts have also been adjusted to conform to current period presentation. This immaterial adjustment had no impact on our previously reported consolidated balance sheets, consolidated statements of income, or consolidated statements of comprehensive income.\nF-11\nThe tables below present a summary of the 2020 and 2019 Statements of Cash Flows as reported and as adjusted:\nUse of Estimates\nIn preparing our consolidated financial statements, we make assumptions, judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on our revenue, operating income and net income, as well as on the value of certain assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. At least quarterly, we evaluate our assumptions, judgments and estimates, and make changes as deemed necessary.\nNasdaq has considered the impact of COVID-19 on the assumptions and estimates used in evaluating our assets and liabilities, including but not limited to our goodwill, intangible assets, equity method investments, equity securities and allowance for losses on accounts receivable. We determined that there was no material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position for the year ended December 31, 2021. These estimates may change as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.\nForeign Currency\nForeign denominated assets and liabilities are remeasured into the functional currency at exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and recorded through the income statement. Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are remeasured using the rates on the dates on which those elements are recognized during the period, and are included in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nTranslation gains or losses resulting from translating our subsidiaries’ financial statements from the local functional currency to the reporting currency, net of tax, are included in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Assets and liabilities are translated at the balance sheet date while revenues and expenses are translated at the date the transaction occurs or at an applicable average rate.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include all non-restricted cash in banks and highly liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less at the time of purchase. Such equivalent investments included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets were $\n109\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n2,509\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. Cash equivalents are carried at cost plus accrued interest, which approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these investments. The decrease in cash equivalents in 2021 was primarily due to the use of net proceeds of $\n1.9\nbillion from issuances of long-term debt in the fourth quarter of 2020 to acquire Verafin in February 2021.\nSee “Acquisition of Verafin,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” for further discussion.\nF-12\nRestricted Cash\nRestricted cash and cash equivalents, which was $\n29\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n37\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, is restricted from withdrawal due to a contractual or regulatory requirement or not available for general use and as such is classified as restricted in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, restricted cash and cash equivalents primarily includes funds held for our trading and clearing businesses.\nDefault Funds and Margin Deposits\nNasdaq Clearing members’ cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by Nasdaq Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nasdaq Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members.\nReceivables, net\nOur receivables are concentrated with our member firms, market data distributors, listed companies, investor relations intelligence, governance and market technology customers. Receivables are shown net of allowance for credit losses. The allowance is maintained at a level that management believes to be sufficient to absorb expected losses over the life of our accounts receivable portfolio. The allowance is increased by the provision for bad debts, which is included in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income, and decreased by the amount of charge-offs, net of recoveries.\nThe allowance is primarily based on an aging methodology. This method applies loss rates based on historical loss information which is disaggregated by business segment and, as deemed necessary, is adjusted for other factors and considerations that could impact collectibility.\nAdditionally, we consider corporate default rate averages over an extended period as compared to the period covered by our historical loss data and include an adjustment to historical loss percentages for current conditions and expected future conditions if necessary.\nIn circumstances where a specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations is known (i.e., bankruptcy filings), we determine whether a specific provision for bad debts is required. Accounts receivable are written-off against the allowance when collection efforts cease. Due to changing economic, business and market conditions, we review the allowance quarterly and make changes to the allowance through the provision for bad debts as appropriate. If circumstances change (i.e., higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer’s ability to pay), our estimates of recoverability could be\nreduced by a material amount.\nThe total allowance netted against receivables in the Consolidated Balance Sheets was $\n17\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, $\n21\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and $\n9\nmillion as of December 31, 2019. The change in the balance in 2021 was immaterial.\nIn 2020 we adopted ASU 2016-13, which changed the impairment model for certain financial instruments. We recorded a $\n12\nmillion non-cash cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings on our opening Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2020 as a result of the adoption of this new standard.\nInvestments\nPurchases and sales of investment securities are recognized on settlement date.\nFinancial investments\nFinancial investments are comprised of trading securities bought principally to meet regulatory capital requirements mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing. These investments are classified as trading securities as they are generally sold in the near term, with changes in fair value included in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nFair value is generally obtained from third party pricing sources. When available, quoted market prices are used to determine fair value. If quoted market prices are not available, fair values are estimated using pricing models with observable market inputs. The inputs to the valuation models vary by the type of security being priced but are typically benchmark yields, reported trades, broker-dealer quotes, and prices of similar assets. Pricing models generally do not entail material subjectivity because the methodologies employed use inputs observed from active markets. See “Fair Value Measurements,” below for further discussion of fair value measures.\nEquity Securities\nInvestments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values (other than those accounted for under the equity method or those that result in consolidation of the investee) are measured at fair value and any changes in fair value are recognized in other income in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nEquity investments without readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the measurement alternative, under which investments are measured at cost, less any impairment,\nplus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer on\na prospective basis.\nWe assess relevant transactions that occur on or before the balance sheet date to identify observable price changes, and we regularly monitor these investments to evaluate whether there is an indication that the investment is impaired, based on t\nhe share price from the investee's latest financing round\n, the performance of the investee in relation to its own operating targets, the investee's liquidity and cash position,\nF-13\nand general market conditions. If a qualitative assessment indicates that the security is impaired, Nasdaq will estimate the fair value of the security and, if the fair value is less than the carrying amount of the security, will recognize an impairment loss in net income equal to the difference in the period\nthe impairment occurs\n.\nSee Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion of our equity securities.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019,\nno\nmaterial adjustments were made to the carrying value of our equity securities.\nOur investments in equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, as we intend to hold these investments for more than one year.\nEquity Method Investments\nIn general, the equity method of accounting is used when we own 20% to 50% of the outstanding voting stock of a company or when we are able to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of a company. We have certain investments in which we have determined that we have significant influence and as such account for the investments under the equity method of accounting. We record our estimated pro-rata share of earnings or losses each reporting period and record any dividends as a reduction in the investment balance. We evaluate our equity method investments for other-than-temporary declines in value by considering a variety of factors such as the earnings capacity of the investment and the fair value of the investment compared to its carrying amount. In addition, for investments where the market value is readily determinable, we consider the underlying stock price. If the estimated fair value of the investment is less than the carrying amount and management considers the decline in value to be other than temporary, the excess of the carrying amount over the estimated fair value is recognized in\nnet income in the period\nthe impairment occurs\n.\nSee Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion of our equity method investments.\nNo\nmaterial impairments were recorded to reduce the carrying value of our equity method investments in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nDerivative Financial Instruments and Hedging Activities\nNon-Designated Derivatives\nWe use foreign exchange forward contracts to manage foreign currency exposure of intercompany loans, accounts receivable, accounts payable and other balance sheet items. These contracts are not designated as hedges for financial reporting purposes. The change in fair value of these contracts is recognized in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and offsets the foreign currency exposure.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value amounts of our derivative instruments were immaterial.\nNet Investment Hedges\nNet assets of our foreign subsidiaries are exposed to volatility in foreign currency exchange rates. We may utilize net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measuring our investment in foreign subsidiaries.\nOur 2029, 2030 and 2033 Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. Any increase or decrease related to the remeasurement of the 2029, 2030, and 2033 Notes into U.S. dollars is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nSee “2029 Notes,” “2030 Notes,” and “2033 Notes,” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” for further discussion.\nProperty and Equipment, net\nProperty and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are carried at cost less asset impairment charges and accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization are recognized using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the related assets, which range from\n10\nto\n40\nyears for buildings and improvements,\n2\nto\n5\nyears for data processing equipment, and\n5\nto\n10\nyears for furniture and equipment.\nLeasehold improvements are amortized using the straight-line method over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the remaining term of the related lease.\nWe develop systems solutions for both internal and external use. Certain costs incurred in connection with developing or obtaining internal use software are capitalized. In addition, certain costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed as a separate product or as part of a product or process are capitalized beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been established and ending when a product is available for general release. Technological feasibility is established upon completion of a detailed program design or, in its absence, completion. Prior to reaching technological feasibility, all costs are charged to expense. Unamortized capitalized costs are included in data processing equipment and software, within property and equipment, net in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Capitalized software costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the software, generally\n5\nto\n10\nyears. Amortization of these costs is included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nImplementation costs incurred in a cloud computing arrangement that is a service contract are capitalized as a prepaid asset included in other assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized over the expected service period in the relevant expense category in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nF-14\nProperty and equipment are subject to impairment testing when events or conditions indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.\nSee Note 7, “Property and Equipment, net,” for further discussion.\nLeases\nAt inception, we determine whether a contract is or contains a lease. W\ne have operating leases which are primarily real estate leases for our U.S. and European headquarters and for general office space.\nAs of December 31, 2021, t\nhese leases have varying lease terms with remaining maturities ranging from\n1\nmonth to\n15\nyears. Operating lease balances are included in operating lease assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. We do not have any leases classified as finance leases.\nOperating lease assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease assets and liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. Since our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The operating lease asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when we are reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Certain of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation based on an index or rate. These payments are included in the initial measurement of the operating lease liability and operating lease asset. However, rental payments that are based on a change in an index or a rate are considered variable lease payments and are expensed as incurred.\nWe have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single performance obligation\nto the extent that the timing and pattern of transfer are similar for the lease and non-lease components and the lease component qualifies as an operating lease\n. We do not recognize lease liabilities and operating lease assets for leases with a term of 12 months or less. We recognize these lease payments on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nSee Note 16, “Leases,” for further discussion.\nGoodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We recognize specifically identifiable intangibles, such as customer relationships, technology, exchange and clearing registrations, trade names and licenses when a specific right or contract is acquired. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite useful lives, primarily exchange and clearing registrations, are not amortized but instead are tested for impairment at least annually as of October 1 and more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of the asset may be less than its carrying amount, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. When testing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment, we have the option of first performing a qualitative assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit or indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than their respective carrying amounts as the basis to determine if it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. If we choose not to complete a qualitative assessment, or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of a reporting unit or the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective estimated fair values, a quantitative test is required.\nIn performing a quantitative impairment test, we compare the fair value of each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset with their respective carrying amounts. If the carrying amounts of the reporting unit or the indefinite-lived intangible asset exceed their respective fair values, an impairment charge is recognized in an amount equal to the difference, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit or the total carrying value of the indefinite-lived intangible asset.\nThere was\nno\nimpairment of goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. Future disruptions to our business and events, such as prolonged economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges in the future.\nF-15\nOther Long-Lived Assets\nWe review our other long-lived assets, such as finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment, for potential impairment when there is evidence that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. The carrying amount of an asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset. Fair value of finite-lived intangible assets and property and equipment is based on various valuation techniques. Any required impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value and is recorded as a reduction in the carrying amount of the related asset and a charge to operating results.\nWe recorded pre-tax, non-cash finite-lived intangible assets impairment charges of $\n14\nmillion in 2021 and property and equipment asset impairment charges of $\n4\nmillion in 2020 and $\n24\nmillion in 2019.\nRevenue Recognition and Transaction-Based Expenses\nRevenue From Contracts With Customers\nOur revenue recognition policies under\nASU 2014-09, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),”\nare described in the following paragraphs.\nContract Balances\nSubstantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. The related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables which is net of an allowance for credit losses of $\n17\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand $\n21\nmillion\nas of December 31, 2020\n.\nThe changes in the balance between periods were immaterial.\nWe do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers.\nFor the majority of our contracts with customers there is no significant variable consideration. We do not have a material amount of revenues recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods. We do not provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year.\nFor contract durations that are one-year or greater, the portion of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations is included in\nNote 3\n, “Revenue From Contracts With Customers.” Deferred revenue primarily represents our contract liabilities related to our fees for annual and initial listings, market technology, IR & ESG services and investment intelligence contracts. Deferred revenue is the only significant contract asset or liability as of December 31, 2021. See Note 8, “Deferred Revenue,” for our discussion of deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition. See “Revenue Recognition” below for further descriptions of our revenue contracts.\nSales commissions earned by our sales force are considered incremental and recoverable costs of obtaining a contract with a customer. These costs are\ndeferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the period of benefit that we have determined to be the contract term or estimated service period. Sales commissions for renewal contracts are deferred and amortized on a straight-line basis over the related contractual renewal period. Amortization expense is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The balance of deferred costs and related amortization expense are not material to our consolidated financial statements. S\nales commissions are expensed when incurred if contract durations are one year or less. Sales taxes are excluded from transaction prices.\nCertain judgments and estimates were used in the identification and timing of satisfaction of performance obligations and the related allocation of transaction price and are discussed below. We believe that these represent a faithful depiction of the transfer of services to our customers.\nRevenue Recognition\nOur primary revenue contract classifications are described below. Although we may discuss additional revenue details in our “Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” the categories below best represent those that depict similar economic characteristics of the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of our revenues and cash flows.\nMarket Technology\nMarket Technology revenues primarily consist of SaaS revenues, software, license and support revenues, and change request revenues.\nIn our market infrastructure technology business, we enter into long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software, and provide support and other services to our customers. We also enter into agreements to modify the system solutions sold by Nasdaq after delivery has occurred. In addition, we enter into subscription agreements which allow customers to connect to our servers to access our software.\nOur long-term contracts with customers to develop customized technology solutions, license the right to use software and provide support and other services to our customers have multiple performance obligations. The performance obligations are generally: (i) software license and installation service and (ii) software support. We have determined that the software license and installation service are not distinct as the license and the customized installation service are inputs to produce the combined output, a functional and integrated software system.\nF-16\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, we allocate the contract transaction price to each performance obligation using our best estimate of the standalone selling price of each distinct good or service in the contract. In instances where standalone selling price is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell the product or service separately, we determine the standalone selling price predominantly through an expected cost plus a margin approach.\nContract modifications are routine in the performance of our contracts. Contracts are often modified to account for changes in contract specifications or requirements. In most instances, contract modifications are for goods and services that are not distinct, and, therefore, are accounted for as part of the existing contract.\nFor our long-term contracts, payments are generally made throughout the contract life and can be dependent on either reaching certain milestones or paid upfront in advance of the service period depending on the stage of the contract. For subscription agreements, contract payment terms can be quarterly, annually or monthly, in advance. For all other contracts, payment terms vary.\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as our customers simultaneously receive and consume the benefits provided by our performance because our customer controls the asset for which we are creating, our performance does not create an asset with alternative use, and we have a right to payment for performance completed to date. For these services, we recognize revenue over time using costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion to measure progress toward satisfying our performance obligation. Incurred costs represent work performed, which corresponds with, and thereby depicts, the transfer of control to the customer. Contract costs generally include labor and direct overhead. For software support and update services, and for subscription agreements which allow customers to connect to our servers to access our software, we generally recognize revenue ratably over the service period beginning on the date our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit consistently over the period as Nasdaq provides the services.\nAccounting for our long-term contracts requires judgment relative to assessing risks and their impact on the estimate of revenues and costs. Our estimates are impacted by factors such as the potential for schedule and technical issues, productivity, and the complexity of work performed. When adjustments in estimated total contract costs are required, any changes in the estimated revenues from prior estimates are recognized in the current period for the effect of such change. If estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenues, a provision for the entire estimated loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nInvestment Intelligence\nMarket Data\nMarket data revenues are earned from U.S. and European proprietary market data products. In the U.S., we also earn revenues from U.S. shared tape plans.\nWe earn revenues primarily based on the number of data subscribers and distributors of our data. Market data revenues are subscription-based and are recognized on a monthly basis.\nFor U.S. tape plans, revenues are collected monthly based on published fee schedules and distributed quarterly to the U.S. exchanges based on a formula required by Regulation NMS that takes into account both trading and quoting activity. Revenues are presented on a net basis as we are acting as an agent in this arrangement.\nMarket Data Revenue Sharing\nThe most significant component of market data revenues recorded on a net basis is the UTP Plan revenue sharing in the U.S. All indicators of principal versus agent reporting under U.S. GAAP have been considered in analyzing the appropriate presentation of the revenue sharing. However, the following are the primary indicators of net reporting:\n•\nWe are the administrator for the plan, in addition to being a participant in the plan. In our unique role as administrator, we facilitate the collection and dissemination of revenues on behalf of the plan participants. As a participant, we share in the net distribution of revenues according to the plan on the same terms as all other plan participants.\n•\nThe operating committee of the plan, which is comprised of representatives from each of the participants, including us solely in our capacity as a plan participant, is responsible for setting the level of fees to be paid by distributors and subscribers and taking action in accordance with the provisions of the plan, subject to SEC approval.\n•\nRisk of loss on the revenue is shared equally among plan participants according to the plan.\nThe exchanges that comprise Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic do not have any material market data revenue sharing agreements.\nIndex\nWe develop and license Nasdaq branded indexes and financial products. We also provide index data products and custom calculation services for third-party clients. Revenues primarily include license fees from these branded indexes and financial products in the U.S. and abroad. We primarily have\ntwo\ntypes of license agreements: transaction-based licenses and asset-based licenses. Transaction-based licenses are generally renewable agreements. Customers are charged based on transaction volume or a minimum contract amount, or both. If a customer is charged based on transaction volume, we recognize revenue when the transaction occurs. If\nF-17\na customer is charged based on a minimum contract amount, we recognize revenue on a pro-rata basis over the licensing term since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Asset-based licenses are also generally renewable agreements. Customers are charged based on a percentage of AUM for licensed products, per the agreement, on a monthly or quarterly basis. These revenues are recognized over the term of the license agreement since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Revenue from index data subscriptions are recognized on a monthly basis.\nAnalytics\nAnalytics revenues are earned from investment content and analytics products. We earn revenues primarily based on the number of content and analytics subscribers and distributors.\nSubscription agreements are generally\none\nto\nthree years\nin term, payable in advance, and provide for automatic renewal. Subscription-based revenues are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nCorporate Platforms\nListing Services\nListing services revenues primarily include initial listing fees and annual renewal fees. Under Topic 606, the initial listing fee is allocated to multiple performance obligations including initial and subsequent listing services and IR & ESG services (when a company qualifies to receive these services under the applicable Nasdaq rule), as well as a customer's material right to renew the option to list on our exchanges. In performing this allocation, the standalone selling price of the performance obligations is based on the initial and annual listing fees and the standalone selling price of the IPO complimentary services is based on its market value. All listing fees are billed upfront and the identified performance obligations are satisfied over time since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the listing service. The amount of revenue related to IPO complimentary services performance obligation is recognized ratably over a\nthree-year\nperiod, which is based on contract terms, with the remaining revenue recognized ratably over\nsix years\nwhich is based on our historical listing experience and projected future listing duration.\nIn the U.S., annual renewal fees are charged to listed companies based on their number of outstanding shares at the end of the prior year and are recognized ratably over the following\ntwelve-month\nperiod since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Annual fees are charged to newly listed companies on a pro-rata basis, based on outstanding shares at the time of listing and recognized over the remainder of the year. European annual renewal fees, which are received from companies listed on our Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Baltic exchanges and Nasdaq First North, are directly related to the listed\ncompanies’ market capitalization on a trailing\ntwelve-month\nbasis and are recognized ratably over the following\ntwelve-month\nperiod since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service.\nIR & ESG Services\nOur IR & ESG Services business includes our Investor Relations Intelligence and Governance Solutions businesses, which serve both public and private companies and organizations.\nIR & ESG Services revenues primarily include subscription and transaction-based income from our investor relations intelligence and governance solutions products and services. Subscription-based revenues earned are recognized over time on a ratable basis over the contract period beginning on the date that our service is made available to the customer since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. Generally, fees are billed in advance and the contract provides for automatic renewal. As part of subscription agreements, customers can also be charged usage fees based upon actual usage of the services provided. Revenues from usage fees are recognized at a point in time when the service is provided.\nMarket Services\nTransaction-Based Trading and Clearing\nTransaction-based trading and clearing includes equity derivative trading and clearing, cash equity trading and FICC revenues. Nasdaq charges transaction fees for trades executed on our exchanges, as well as on orders that are routed to and executed on other market venues. Nasdaq charges clearing fees for contracts cleared with Nasdaq Clearing.\nIn the U.S., transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our U.S. exchanges and in Europe, transaction fees are based on the volume and value of traded and cleared contracts. In Canada, transaction fees are based on trading volumes for trades executed on our Canadian exchange.\nNasdaq satisfies its performance obligation for trading services upon the execution of a customer trade and clearing services when a contract is cleared, as trading and clearing transactions are substantially complete when they are executed and we have no further obligation to the customer at that time. Transaction-based trading and clearing fees can be variable and are based on trade volume tiered discounts. Transaction revenues, as well as any tiered volume discounts, are calculated and billed monthly in accordance with our published fee schedules. In the U.S., we also pay liquidity payments to customers based on our published fee schedules. We use these payments to improve the liquidity on our markets and therefore recognize those payments as a cost of revenue.\nThe majority of our FICC trading and clearing customers are charged transaction fees, as discussed above, which are primarily based on volume of traded and cleared contracts.\nF-18\nFor U.S. equity derivative trading, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity. For U.S. cash equity trading, for The Nasdaq Stock Market, Nasdaq PSX and Nasdaq CXC, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that provides the liquidity, and for Nasdaq BX and Nasdaq CX2, we credit a portion of the per share execution charge to the market participant that takes the liquidity. We record these credits as transaction rebates that are included in transaction-based expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income. These transaction rebates are paid on a monthly basis and the amounts due are included in accounts payable and accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the U.S., we pay Section 31 fees to the SEC for supervision and regulation of securities markets. We pass these costs along to our customers through our equity derivative trading and clearing fees and our cash equity trading fees. We collect the fees as a pass-through charge from organizations executing eligible trades on our options exchanges and our cash equity platforms and we recognize these amounts in transaction-based expenses when incurred. Section 31 fees received are included in cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at the time of receipt and, as required by law, the amount due to the SEC is remitted semiannually and recorded as Section 31 fees payable to the SEC in the Consolidated Balance Sheets until paid. Since the amount recorded as revenues is equal to the amount recorded as transaction-based expenses, there is no impact on our revenues less transaction-based expenses. As we hold the cash received until payment to the SEC, we earn interest income on the related cash balances.\nUnder our Limitation of Liability Rule and procedures, we may, subject to certain caps, provide compensation for losses directly resulting from our systems’ actual failure to correctly process an order, quote, message or other data into our platform. We do not record a liability for any potential claims that may be submitted under the Limitation of Liability Rule unless they meet the provisions required in accordance with U.S. GAAP. As such, losses arising as a result of the rule are accrued and charged to expense only if the loss is probable and estimable.\nTrade Management Services\nWe provide market participants with a wide variety of alternatives for connecting to and accessing our markets for a fee. We also offer market participants colocation services,\nwhereby we charge firms for cabinet space and power to house their own equipment and servers within our data centers.\nThese participants are charged monthly fees for cabinet space, connectivity and support in accordance with our published fee schedules. These fees are recognized on a monthly basis when the performance obligation is met.\nWe also earn revenues from annual and monthly exchange membership and registration fees. Revenues for monthly exchange membership and registration fees are recognized on a monthly basis as the service is provided. Revenues from annual fees for exchange membership and registration fees\nare recognized ratably over the following\ntwelve-month\nperiod since the customer receives and consumes the benefit as Nasdaq provides the service. We also offer broker services to financial participants in the Nordic market primarily offering back office technology solutions. Revenues from broker services are based on a fixed basic fee for licensing, maintenance and support and development, and an incremental fee depending on the number of transactions. Broker services revenues are generally billed and recognized monthly. As previously disclosed, in January 2020, we commenced an orderly wind-down of this broker services business. We expect this wind-down to continue through the second quarter of 2022.\nOther Revenues\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, other revenues include the revenues associated with our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was sold in June 2021. Prior to the sale date, these revenues were included in our Market Services and Investment Intelligence segments. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4,“Acquisitions and Divestiture,” to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this divestiture. Additionally, other revenues include revenues associated with the NPM business which we contributed to a standalone, independent company, of which we own the largest minority interest, together with a consortium of third party financial institutions in July 2021. Prior to July, these revenues were included in our Corporate Platforms segment. For the year ended December 31, 2019, other revenues also include the revenues from the BWise enterprise governance, risk and compliance software platform, which was sold in March 2019. Prior to the sale date, these revenues were included in our IR & ESG Services business within our Corporate Platforms segment and were both subscription and transaction-based revenues.\nEarnings Per Share\nWe present both basic and diluted earnings per share. Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Nasdaq by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding for the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by dividing net income attributable to Nasdaq by the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding during the period and reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities, which primarily consist of restricted stock, PSUs, and employee stock options. Common share equivalents are excluded from the computation in periods for which they have an anti-dilutive effect. Stock options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation. Shares which are considered contingently issuable are included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share on a weighted average basis when management determines the applicable performance criteria would have been met if the performance period ended as of the date of the relevant computation.\nSee Note 13, “Earnings Per Share,” for further discussion.\nF-19\nPension and Post-Retirement Benefits\nPension and other post-retirement benefit plan information for financial reporting purposes is developed using actuarial valuations. We assess our pension and other post-retirement benefit plan assumptions on a regular basis. In evaluating these assumptions, we consider many factors, including evaluation of the discount rate, expected rate of return on plan assets, mortality rate, healthcare cost trend rate, retirement age assumption, our historical assumptions compared with actual results and analysis of current market conditions and asset allocations. See Note 10, “Retirement Plans,” for further discussion.\nDiscount rates used for pension and other post-retirement benefit plan calculations are evaluated annually and modified to reflect the prevailing market rates at the measurement date of a high-quality fixed-income debt instrument portfolio that would provide the future cash flows needed to pay the benefits included in the benefit obligations as they come due. Actuarial assumptions are based upon management’s best estimates and judgment.\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets for our U.S. pension plans represents our long-term assessment of return expectations which may change based on significant shifts in economic and financial market conditions. The long-term rate of return on plan assets is derived from return assumptions based on targeted allocations for various asset classes. While we consider the pension plans’ recent performance and other economic growth and inflation factors, which are supported by long-term historical data, the return expectations for the targeted asset categories represent a long-term prospective return.\nShare-Based Compensation\nNasdaq uses the fair value method of accounting for share-based awards. Share-based awards, or equity awards, include restricted stock, PSUs, and stock options. The fair value of restricted stock awards and PSUs, other than PSUs granted with market conditions, is determined based on the grant date closing stock price less the present value of future cash dividends. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted with market conditions using a Monte Carlo simulation model at the date of grant. The fair value of stock options are estimated using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model.\nWe generally recognize compensation expense for equity awards on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period of the award, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate. Granted but unvested shares are generally forfeited upon termination of employment.\nExcess tax benefits or expense related to employee share-based payments, if any, are recognized as income tax benefit or expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income when the awards vest or are settled.\nNasdaq also has an ESPP that allows eligible employees to purchase a limited number of shares of our common stock at six-month intervals, called offering periods, at\n85.0\n% of the lower of the fair market value on the first or the last day of each offering period. The\n15.0\n% discount given to our employees is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSee Note 11, “Share-Based Compensation,” for further discussion of our share-based compensation plans.\nMerger and Strategic Initiatives\nWe incur incremental direct merger and strategic initiative costs relating to various completed and potential acquisitions, divestitures, and other strategic opportunities. These costs generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. As of December 31, 2021, all planned integrations have been completed.\nFair Value Measurements\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a liability, or the exit price, in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be either recorded or disclosed at fair value, we consider the principal or most advantageous market in which we would transact, and we also consider assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability. Fair value measurement establishes a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to those valuation techniques are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect Nasdaq’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\n•\nLevel 1 - Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\n•\nLevel 2 - Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs are observable or whose significant value drivers are observable.\n•\nLevel 3 - Instruments whose significant value drivers are unobservable.\nThis hierarchy requires the use of observable market data when available.\nSee Note 14, “Fair Value of Financial Instruments,” for further discussion.\nF-20\nTax Matters\nWe use the asset and liability method to determine income taxes on all transactions recorded in the consolidated financial statements. Deferred tax assets (net of valuation allowances) and deferred tax liabilities are presented net by jurisdiction as either a non-current asset or liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, as appropriate. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities (i.e., temporary differences) and are measured at the enacted rates that will be in effect when these differences are realized. If necessary, a valuation allowance is established to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized.\nIn order to recognize and measure our unrecognized tax benefits, management determines whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. Once it is determined that a position meets the recognition thresholds, the position is measured to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the consolidated financial statements. Interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters are recognized in income tax expense.\nSubsequent Events\nWe have evaluated subsequent events through the issuance date of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 21, “Subsequent Events,” for further discussion.\nRecent Accounting Developments\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers.” The ASU requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities from acquired contracts using the revenue recognition guidance under Topic 606 in order to align the recognition of a contract liability with the definition of a performance obligation. This approach differs from the current requirement to measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination at fair value. This ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2022 on a prospective basis.\n3.\nREVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe following tables summarize the disaggregation of revenue by major product and service and by segment for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nSubstantially all revenues from the Market Technology, Investment Intelligence and Corporate Platforms segments were recognized over time\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 approximately\n70.8\n%,\n69.8\n% and\n64.4\n%, respectively, of Market Services revenues were recognized at a point in time and\n29.2\n%,\n30.2\n% and\n35.6\n%, respectively, were recognized over time.\nContract Balances\nSubstantially all of our revenues are considered to be revenues from contracts with customers. The related accounts receivable balances are recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as receivables, which are net of allowance for doubtful accounts of $\n17\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021\nand $\n21\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. The changes in the balance between periods were immaterial. We do not have obligations for warranties, returns or refunds to customers.\nFor the majority of our contracts with customers, except for our market technology and listings services contracts, our performance obligations range from\nthree months\nto\nthree years\nand there is no significant variable consideration.\nF-21\nDeferred revenue is the only significant contract asset or liability as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n.\nDeferred revenue represents consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue for unsatisfied performance obligations.\nDeferred revenue primarily represents our contract liabilities related to our fees for Market Technology, Analytics, annual and initial listings, and IR & ESG Services contracts. See Note 8, “Deferred Revenue,” for our discussion on deferred revenue balances, activity, and expected timing of recognition.\nWe do not have a material amount of revenue recognized from performance obligations that were satisfied in prior periods. We do not provide disclosures about transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations if contract durations are less than one year. For our initial listings the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations is included in deferred revenue. For our market technology, Analytics, and IR & ESG contracts the portion of transaction price allocated to unsatisfied performance obligations is presented in the table below.\nTo the extent consideration has been received, unsatisfied performance obligations would be included in the table below as well as deferred revenue.\nThe following table summarizes the amount of the transaction price allocated to performance obligations that are unsatisfied, for contract durations greater than one year, as of December 31, 2021:\n4.\nACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURE\nWe completed the following divestiture and acquisitions in 2021 and 2020. Financial results of each transaction are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of each acquisition.\n2021 Divestiture\nIn June 2021, we sold our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was part of our FICC business within our Market Services segment, to Tradeweb Markets Inc. We recognized a pre-tax gain on the sale of $\n84\nmillion, net of disposal costs. The pre-tax gain is included in net gain on divestiture of businesses in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nAs part of the purchase price consideration related to this business when it was acquired in 2013, we agreed to future annual issuances of\n992,247\nshares of Nasdaq common stock, which approximated certain tax benefits associated with the transaction. Such contingent future issuances of Nasdaq common stock were to be issued annually through 2027 if Nasdaq’s total gross revenues equaled or exceeded $\n25\nmillion in each such year. The contingent future issuances of Nasdaq common stock were subject to anti-dilution protections and acceleration upon certain events.\nUpon the consummation of the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business, the aggregate number of Nasdaq shares remaining under the contingent obligation described above were reduced (pursuant to the discounting adjustment provisions set forth in the original purchase agreement for Nasdaq's acquisition of the business) and accelerated, resulting in an issuance of approximately\n6.2\nmillion shares of Nasdaq common stock to an assignee of the entity that sold this business to us in 2013.\nNasdaq intends to use the proceeds from the sale, available tax benefits and working and clearing capital of this business, as well as other sources of cash, to repurchase shares of Nasdaq common stock to reduce the impact on earnings per share dilution from the sale.\nTo facilitate these repurchases, the board of directors authorized an increase to the share repurchase program. See “Share Repurchase Program,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders' Equity,” for further discussion.\n2021 Acquisition\nAcquisition of Verafin\nIn February 2021, we completed the acquisition of Verafin, a SaaS technology provider of anti-financial crime management solutions that provides a cloud-based platform to help detect, investigate, and report money laundering and financial fraud, for an aggregate purchase price of $\n2.75\nbillion, subject to certain adjustments. The $\n2.75\nbillion purchase price includes a cash payment of $\n102\nmillion, reflected in cash from operating activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, the release of which is subject to certain employment-related conditions over\nthree years\nfollowing the closing of the transaction. This payment was recorded as a prepaid expense and is recorded in other current and non-current assets in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and will be amortized to merger and strategic initiatives expense on a straight-line basis over a\nthree-year\nperiod. Verafin is part of our Market Technology segment.\nNasdaq used the net proceeds from our offering of senior notes in December 2020, commercial paper issuances, and cash on hand to fund this acquisition. See “Commercial Paper Program,” and “Senior Unsecured Notes Due 2022, 2031 and 2040,” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” for further discussion.\nF-22\nAs of December 31, 2021, the allocation of purchase price includes the effect of a $\n9\nmillion measurement period adjustment recorded during the second quarter. This adjustment resulted in an increase to both total net liabilities acquired and goodwill. Additional adjustments to the provisional values may result before the end of the measurement period, a period not to exceed 12 months from the acquisition date. These adjustments, which may include tax and other estimates will be recorded in the reporting period in which the adjustment amounts are determined. Changes to amounts recorded as assets and liabilities may result in a corresponding adjustment to goodwill.\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table presents the details of acquired intangible assets for Verafin at the date of acquisition. Acquired intangible assets with finite lives are amortized using the straight-line method.\nCustomer Relationships\nCustomer relationships represent the non-contractual and contractual relationships with customers.\nMethodology\nCustomer relationships were valued using the income approach, specifically an excess earnings method. The excess earnings method examines the economic returns contributed by the identified tangible and intangible assets of a company, and then isolates the excess return that is attributable to the intangible asset being valued.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used reflects the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for the customer relationships relative to the overall business. In developing a discount rate for the customer relationships, we estimated a weighted-average cost of capital for the overall business and we utilized this rate as an input when discounting the cash flows. The resulting discounted cash flows were then tax-effected at the applicable statutory rate.\nFor our acquisition of Verafin, a discounted tax amortization benefit was added to the fair value of the assets under the assumption that the customer relationships would be amortized for tax purposes over a period of\n20\nyears.\nEstimated Useful Life\nWe estimate the useful life based on the historical behavior of the customers and a parallel analysis of the customers using the excess earnings method.\nTechnology\nAs part of our acquisition of Verafin, we acquired developed technology.\nMethodology\nThe developed technology was valued using the income approach, specifically the relief-from-royalty method, or RFRM. The RFRM is used to estimate the cost savings that accrue to the owner of an intangible asset who would otherwise have to pay royalties or license fees on revenues earned through the use of the asset. The royalty rate is applied to the projected revenue over the expected remaining life of the intangible asset to estimate royalty savings. The net after-tax royalty savings are calculated for each year in the remaining economic life of the technology and discounted to present value.\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rates used reflect the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for the developed technology relative to the overall business as discussed above in “Customer Relationships.”\nEstimated Useful Life\nWe have estimated the useful life of the Verafin technology to be\n7\nyears.\nTrade Name\nAs part of our acquisition of Verafin, we acquired a trade name. The trade name is recognized in the industry and carries a reputation for quality. As such, the reputation and positive recognition embodied in the trade name is a valuable asset to Nasdaq.\nMethodology\nThe Verafin trade name was valued using the income approach, specifically the RFRM as discussed above in “Technology.”\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate used reflects the amount of risk associated with the hypothetical cash flows for the trade name relative to the overall business as discussed above in “Customer Relationships.”\nF-23\nEstimated Useful Life\nWe have estimated the useful life of the Verafin trade name to be\n20\nyears and our intention is to continue to use it in the branding of products.\n2020 Acquisition\nAcquisition of Solovis\nIn March 2020, we acquired Solovis, a provider of multi-asset class portfolio management, analytics and reporting tools across public and private markets. Solovis is part of our Investment Intelligence segment.\nPro Forma Results and Acquisition-Related Costs\nThe consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 include the financial results of the above acquisitions from the dates of these acquisitions. Pro forma financial results have not been presented since these acquisitions both individually and in the aggregate were not material to our financial results.\nAcquisition-related costs for the transactions described above\nwere expensed as incurred and are included in merger and strategic initiatives expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\n5.\nGOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe following table presents the changes in goodwill by business segment during the year ended December 31, 2021:\nIn the table above:\n•\nDivestiture of business relates to the sale of our U.S. Fixed Income business. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” for further discussion. In addition to revenues earned through Market Services, our U.S. Fixed Income business also earned fees from market data, which are included in our Investment Intelligence segment. Therefore, a portion of the goodwill was allocated to this segment.\n•\nOther adjustments includes foreign currency translation adjustment. For Market Technology, it also includes a measurement period adjustment related to our acquisition of Verafin. See “2021 Acquisition,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” for further discussion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the amount of goodwill, primarily relating to our acquisition of Verafin, that is expected to be deductible for tax purposes in future periods is $\n1.8\nbillion.\nF-24\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over the value assigned to the net assets, including identifiable intangible assets, of a business acquired. Goodwill is allocated to our reporting units based on the assignment of the fair values of each reporting unit of the acquired company. We test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level annually, or in interim periods if certain events occur indicating that the carrying amount may be impaired, such as changes in the business climate, poor indicators of operating performance or the sale or disposition of a significant portion of a reporting unit. There was\nno\nimpairment of goodwill for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019; however, events such as prolonged economic weakness or unexpected significant declines in operating results of any of our reporting units or businesses, may result in goodwill impairment charges in the future.\nAcquired\nIntangible Assets\nThe following table presents details of our total acquired intangible assets, both finite- and indefinite-lived:\nThe change in the gross and net amounts for technology, customer relationships and trade names and other finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020 is primarily related to our acquisition of Verafin. The change in the gross and net amounts for customer relationships as of December 31, 2021 compared with December 31, 2020 is also related to the divestiture of our U.S. Fixed Income business. See “2021 Acquisition,” and “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” for further discussion of these transactions. There was\nno\nimpairment of indefinite-lived intangible assets for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. We recorded an impairment charge of $\n14\nmillion in 2021 related to a finite-lived intangible asset for customer relationships associated with the wind down of a previous acquisition included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. There were\nno\nmaterial finite-lived impairment charges in 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table presents our amortization expense for acquired finite-lived intangible assets:\nThe increase in amortization expense for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared with the same periods in 2020 and 2019 was primarily due to additional amortization expense for acquired intangible assets related to our acquisition of Verafin. These amounts are included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe table below presents the estimated future amortization expense (excluding the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments of $\n62\nmillion as of December 31, 2021) of acquired finite-lived intangible assets as of December 31, 2021:\nF-25\n6.\nINVESTMENTS\nThe following table presents the details of our investments:\nFinancial Investments\nFinancial investments are comprised of trading securities, primarily highly rated European government debt securities, of which $\n162\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n175\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2020,\nare assets primarily utilized to meet regulatory capital requirements, mainly for our clearing operations at Nasdaq Clearing.\nEquity Method Investments\nWe record our estimated pro-rata share of earnings or losses each reporting period and record any dividends as a reduction in the investment balance. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, our equity method investments primarily included our\n40.0\n% equity interest in OCC.\nThe carrying amounts of our equity method investments are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. No material impairments were recorded for the years end December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nNet income recognized from our equity interest in the earnings and losses of these equity method investments, primarily OCC, was $\n52\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n70\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n84\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019. For the year ended December 31, 2021, lower equity interest in the earnings of OCC as compared to 2020 and 2019 is primarily driven by a reduction, in 2021, in the clearing fee rates that OCC charged its customers.\nEquity Securities\nThe carrying amounts of our equity securities are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. We elected the measurement alternative for primarily all of our equity securities as they do not have a readily determinable fair value. No material adjustments were made to the carrying value of our equity securities for the year ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. As of December 31, 2021 and\nDecember 31, 2020\n, our equity securities primarily represent various strategic investments made through our corporate venture program as well as investments acquired through various acquisitions.\n7.\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, NET\nThe following table presents our major categories of property and equipment, net:\nDepreciation and amortization expense for property and equipment was $\n108\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n99\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020, and $\n89\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019. These amounts are included in depreciation and amortization expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe recorded pre-tax, non-cash property and equipment asset impairment charges on capitalized software that was retired and accelerated depreciation expense on certain assets as a result of a decrease in their useful life of $\n4\nmillion in 2021, $\n14\nmillion in 2020 and $\n26\nmillion in 2019. These charges are included in restructuring charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” for a discussion of our 2019 restructuring plan. There were\nno\nother material impairments of property and equipment recorded in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not own any real estate properties.\n8.\nDEFERRED REVENUE\nDeferred revenue represents consideration received that is yet to be recognized as revenue.\nThe changes in our deferred revenue during the year ended December 31, 2021 are reflected in the following table:\nF-26\nIn the preceding table:\n•\nAdditions primarily reflect deferred revenue billed in the current period, net of recognition. Market Technology additions include deferred revenue acquired as part of the acquisition of Verafin.\n•\nRevenue recognized includes revenue recognized during the current period that was included in the beginning balance.\n•\nAdjustments reflect foreign currency translation adjustments.\n•\nOther primarily includes deferred revenue from non-U.S. listing of additional shares fees. Listing of additional shares fees are included in our Listing Services business.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we estimate that our deferred revenue will be recognized in the following years:\nIn the above table, the timing of recognition of our deferred market technology revenues is primarily dependent upon the completion of customization and any significant modifications made pursuant to existing market technology contracts. As such, as it relates to market technology revenues, the timing represents our best estimate.\n9.\nDEBT OBLIGATIONS\nThe following table presents the changes in the carrying amount of our debt obligations during the year ended December 31, 2021:\nIn the table above, the 2022 Notes were reclassified to short-term debt as of December 31, 2021.\nCommercial Paper Program\nOur U.S. dollar commercial paper program is supported by our 2020 Credit Facility which provides liquidity support for the repayment of commercial paper issued through this program. See “2020 Credit Facility” below for further discussion. The effective interest rate of commercial paper issuances fluctuates as short term interest rates and demand fluctuate. The fluctuation of these rates may impact our interest expense.\nIn February 2021, we issued $\n475\nmillion of commercial paper to partially fund the acquisition of Verafin. For further discussion of the acquisition of Verafin, see “2021 Acquisition,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture.”\nF-27\nIn July 2021, we issued commercial paper to partially fund our ASR agreement. See “ASR Agreements,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders' Equity.\"\nAs of December 31, 2021, commercial paper notes in the table above reflect the aggregate principal amount outstanding, less the unamortized discount which is being accreted through interest expense over the life of the applicable notes. The original maturities of these notes range from\n31\ndays to\n66\ndays and the weighted-average maturity is\n29\ndays. The weighted-average effective interest rate is\n0.34\n% per annum.\nSenior Unsecured Notes\nOur 2022 and 2040 Notes were issued at par. All of our other outstanding senior unsecured notes were issued at a discount. As a result of the discount, the proceeds received from each issuance were less than the aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2021, the amounts in the table above reflect the aggregate principal amount, less the unamortized debt discount and the unamortized debt issuance costs which are being accreted through interest expense over the life of the applicable notes. For our Euro denominated notes, the “Payments, Foreign Currency Translation and Accretion” column also includes the impact of foreign currency translation. Our senior unsecured notes are general unsecured obligations which rank equally with all of our existing and future unsubordinated obligations and are not guaranteed by any of our subsidiaries. The senior unsecured notes were issued under indentures that, among other things, limit our ability to consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets, create liens, and enter into sale and leaseback transactions. The senior unsecured notes may be redeemed by Nasdaq at any time, subject to a make-whole amount.\nUpon a change of control triggering event (as defined in the various supplemental indentures governing the applicable notes), the terms require us to repurchase all or part of each holder’s notes for cash equal to\n101\n% of the aggregate principal amount purchased plus accrued and unpaid interest, if\nany.\n2024 Notes\nIn May 2014, Nasdaq issued the 2024 Notes, which pay interest semiannually at a rate of\n4.25\n% per annum until June 1, 2024. Such interest rate may vary with Nasdaq’s debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to a rate not to exceed\n6.25\n%.\nEarly Extinguishment of 2023 Notes\nNasdaq issued the 2023 Notes in May 2016, which paid interest annually at a rate of\n1.75\n% per annum. In August 2021, we primarily used the net proceeds from the 2033 Notes to repay in full and redeem our 2023 Notes. For further discussion see “2033 Notes” below. In connection with the early extinguishment of the 2023 Notes, we recorded a pre-tax charge of $\n33\nmillion, which primarily includes a make-whole redemption price premium. This charge is included in general, administrative and other expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2026 Notes\nIn June 2016, Nasdaq issued the 2026 Notes, which pay interest semi-annually at a rate of\n3.85\n% per annum until June 30, 2026. Such interest rate may vary with Nasdaq’s debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to a rate not to exceed\n5.85\n%.\n2029 Notes\nIn April 2019, Nasdaq issued the 2029 Notes, which pay interest annually at a rate of\n1.75\n% per annum until March 28, 2029. Such interest rate may vary with Nasdaq’s debt rating,\nto the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade,\nup to a rate not to exceed\n3.75\n%.\nThe 2029 Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. The\ndecrease in the carrying amount of $\n50\nmillion\nnoted in the “Payments, Foreign Currency Translation and Accretion” column in the table above primarily reflects the remeasurement of the 2029 Notes into U.S. dollars and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within Nasdaq's stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\n2030 Notes\nIn February 2020, Nasdaq issued the 2030 Notes. The 2030 Notes pay interest annually in arrears, which began on February 13, 2021.\nThe 2030 Notes were designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries. The decrease in the carrying amount of $\n50\nmillion noted in the “Payments, Foreign Currency Translation and Accretion” column in the table above primarily reflects the remeasurement of the 2030 Notes into U.S. dollars and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within Nasdaq's stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2021.\n2050 Notes\nIn April 2020, Nasdaq issued the 2050 Notes. The 2050 Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears, which began on October 28, 2020. The interest rate of\n3.25\n% may vary with Nasdaq's debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to a rate not to exceed\n5.25\n%.\nSenior Unsecured Notes Due 2022, 2031 and 2040\nIn December 2020, Nasdaq issued the 2022, 2031 and 2040 Notes. The net proceeds were used to partially fund the acquisition of Verafin. For further discussion of the acquisition of Verafin, see “2021 Acquisition,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture.”\nF-28\n2022 Notes\nThe 2022 Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears, which began on June 21, 2021. The interest rate of\n0.445\n% may vary with Nasdaq's debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to a rate not to exceed\n2.445\n%.\n2031 Notes\nThe 2031 Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears, which began on January 15, 2021. The interest rate of\n1.650\n% may vary with Nasdaq's debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to a rate not to exceed\n3.65\n%.\n2040 Notes\nThe 2040 Notes pay interest semi-annually in arrears, which began on June 21, 2021. The interest rate of\n2.500\n% may vary with Nasdaq's debt rating, to the extent Nasdaq is downgraded below investment grade, up to a rate not to exceed\n4.50\n%.\n2033 Notes\nIn July 2021, Nasdaq issued €\n615\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n0.900\n% senior notes due in 2033, which pay interest annually in arrears, beginning on July 30, 2022. The net proceeds from the 2033 Notes were approximately $\n726\nmillion after deducting the underwriting discount and expenses of the offering. We primarily used the net proceeds from the 2033 Notes to redeem all of the 2023 Notes. For further discussion of the 2023 Notes, see “Early Extinguishment of 2023 Notes” above.\nThe 2033 Notes have been designated as a hedge of our net investment in certain foreign subsidiaries to mitigate the foreign exchange risk associated with certain investments in these subsidiaries.\nThe\ndecrease in the carrying amount of $\n32\nmillion\nnoted in the “Payments, Foreign Currency Translation and Accretion” column in the table above primarily reflects the remeasurement of the 2033 Notes into U.S. dollars and is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within Nasdaq stockholders’ equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as of\nDecember 31, 2021.\nCredit Facilities\n2020 Credit Facility\nIn December 2020, Nasdaq entered into the 2020 Credit Facility, which replaced a former credit facility and consists of a $\n1.25\nbillion\nfive-year\nrevolving credit facility (with sublimits for non-dollar borrowings, swingline borrowings and letters of credit). Nasdaq intends to use funds available under the 2020 Credit Facility for general corporate purposes and to provide liquidity support for the repayment of commercial paper issued through the commercial paper program. Nasdaq is permitted to repay borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility at any time in whole or in part, without penalty.\nAs of December 31, 2021,\nno\namounts were outstanding on the 2020 Credit Facility. The $(\n4\n) million balance represents unamortized debt issuance costs which are being accreted through interest expense over the life of the credit facility. Of the $\n1.25\nbillion that is available for borrowing, $\n420\nmillion provides liquidity support for the commercial paper program. As such, as of December 31, 2021, the total remaining amount available under the 2020 Credit Facility was $\n830\nmillion, excluding the amounts that support the commercial paper program. See “Commercial Paper Program” above for further discussion of our commercial paper program.\nUnder our 2020 Credit Facility, borrowings under the revolving credit facility and swingline borrowings bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a variable interest rate based on either the LIBOR (or a successor rate to LIBOR), the base rate (as defined in the credit agreement), or other applicable rate with respect to non-dollar borrowings, plus an applicable margin that varies with Nasdaq’s debt rating. We are charged commitment fees of\n0.125\n% to\n0.350\n%, depending on our credit rating, whether or not amounts have been borrowed. These commitment fees are included in interest expense and were not material for the year ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe 2020 Credit Facility contains financial and operating covenants. Financial covenants include a maximum leverage ratio. Operating covenants include, among other things, limitations on Nasdaq’s ability to incur additional indebtedness, grant liens on assets, dispose of assets and make certain restricted payments. The facility also contains customary affirmative covenants, including access to financial statements, notice of defaults and certain other material events, maintenance of properties and insurance, and customary events of default, including cross-defaults to our material indebtedness.\nThe 2020 Credit Facility includes an option for Nasdaq to increase the available aggregate amount by up to $\n625\nmillion, subject to the consent of the lenders funding the increase and certain other conditions.\nOther Credit Facilities\nCertain of our European subsidiaries have several other credit facilities, which are available in multiple currencies, primarily to support our Nasdaq Clearing operations in Europe, as well as to provide a cash pool credit line for one subsidiary. These credit facilities, in aggregate, totaled $\n212\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n232\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 in available liquidity,\nnone\nof which was utilized. Generally, these facilities each have a one year term. The amounts borrowed under these various credit facilities bear interest on the principal amount outstanding at a variable interest rate based on a base rate (as defined in the applicable credit agreement), plus an applicable margin. We are charged commitment fees (as defined in the applicable credit agreement), whether or not amounts have been borrowed. These commitment fees are included in interest expense and were not material for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nF-29\nThese facilities include customary affirmative and negative operating covenants and events of default.\nDebt Covenants\nAs of December 31, 2021, we were in compliance with the covenants of all of our debt obligations.\n10.\nRETIREMENT PLANS\nDefined Contribution Savings Plan\nWe sponsor a 401(k) Plan for U.S. employees. Employees are immediately eligible to make contributions to the plan and are also eligible for an employer contribution match at an amount equal to\n100.0\n% of the first\n6.0\n% of eligible employee contributions. Savings plan expense included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income was $\n14\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n14\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n13\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nPension and Supplemental Executive Retirement Plans\nWe maintain non-contributory, defined-benefit pension plans, non-qualified SERPs for certain senior executives and other post-retirement benefit plans for eligible employees in the U.S., collectively referred to as the Nasdaq Benefit Plans. Our pension plans and SERPs are frozen. Future service and salary for all participants do not count toward an accrual of benefits under the pension plans and SERPs. Most employees outside the U.S. are covered by local retirement plans or by applicable social laws. Benefits under social laws are generally expensed in the periods in which the costs are incurred. The total expense for these plans is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income and was $\n26\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n23\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n20\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNasdaq recognizes the funded status of the Nasdaq Benefit Plans, measured as the difference between the fair value of the plan assets and the benefit obligation, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of our U.S. defined-benefit pension plans' assets was $\n111\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and the benefit obligation was $\n112\nmillion as of December 31, 2021. As a result, the U.S. defined-benefit pension plans are underfunded by $\n1\nmillion as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of our U.S. defined-benefit pension plans' assets was $\n119\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 and the benefit obligation was $\n118\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. As a result, the U.S. defined-benefit pension plans were fully funded as of December 31, 2020. During 2021 and 2020, we did\nnot\nmake any contributions to our U.S. defined-benefit pension plans. For our SERP and other post-retirement benefit plans, the net underfunded liability was $\n34\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n30\nmillion as of December 31, 2020. The underfunded liability for the above plans is included in accrued personnel costs and other non-current liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The\nplan assets of the Nasdaq Benefit Plans are invested per target allocations adopted by Nasdaq’s Pension and 401(k) Committee and are primarily invested in collective fund investments that have underlying investments in fixed income securities. The collective fund investments are valued at net asset value which is a practical expedient to estimate fair value.\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nAs of December 31, 2021, accumulated other comprehensive\nloss for the Nasdaq Benefit Plans was $\n26\nmillion reflecting an unrecognized net loss of $\n33\nmillion, partially offset by an income tax benefit of $\n7\nmillion, primarily due to our pension plans.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nWe expect to make the following benefit payments to participants in the next ten fiscal years under the Nasdaq Benefit Plans:\n11.\nSHARE-BASED COMPENSATION\nWe have a share-based compensation program for employees and non-employee directors. Share-based awards granted under this program include restricted stock (consisting of restricted stock units), PSUs and stock options. For accounting purposes, we consider PSUs to be a form of restricted stock.\nSummary of Share-Based Compensation Expense\nThe following table presents the total share-based compensation expense resulting from equity awards and the\n15.0\n% discount for the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, which is included in compensation and benefits expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income:\nF-30\nCommon Shares Available Under Our Equity Plan\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately\n9.5\nmillion shares of common stock authorized for future issuance under our Equity Plan.\nRestricted Stock\nWe grant restricted stock to most employees. The grant date fair value of restricted stock awards is based on the closing stock price at the date of grant less the present value of future cash dividends. Restricted stock awards granted to employees below the manager level generally vest\n33.3\n% on the first anniversary of the grant date,\n33.3\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date, and\n33.3\n% on the third anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock awards granted to employees at or above the manager level generally vest\n33.3\n% on the second anniversary of the grant date,\n33.3\n% on the third anniversary of the grant date, and\n33.3\n% on the fourth anniversary of the grant date.\nSummary of Restricted Stock Activity\nThe following table summarizes our restricted stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nAs of December 31, 2021, $\n81\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted stock is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.8\nyears.\nPSUs\nPSUs are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each recipient will receive upon vesting. Prior to April 1, 2020, we had\ntwo\nperformance-based PSU programs for certain officers, a\none-year\nperformance-based program and a\nthree-year\ncumulative performance-based program that focuses on TSR. Effective April 1, 2020, to better align the equity programs for eligible officers, the\none-year\nperformance-based program was eliminated and all eligible officers now participate in the\nthree-year\ncumulative performance-based program. While the performance periods are complete for all PSUs granted under the\none-year\nperformance-based program, some shares underlying these PSUs have not vested.\nOne-Year\nPSU Program\nThe grant date fair value of PSUs under the\none-year\nperformance-based program was based on the closing stock price at the date of grant less the present value of future cash dividends. Under this program, an eligible employee received a target grant of PSUs, but could have received from\n0.0\n% to\n150.0\n% of the target amount granted, depending on the achievement of performance measures. These awards vest ratably on an annual basis over a\nthree-year\nperiod commencing with the end of the\none-year\nperformance period. Compensation cost is recognized over the performance period and the\nthree-year\nvesting period based on the probability that such performance measures will be achieved, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate.\nThree-Year\nPSU Program\nUnder the\nthree-year\nperformance-based program, each eligible individual receives PSUs, subject to market conditions, with a\nthree-year\ncumulative performance period that vest at the end of the performance period. Compensation cost is recognized over the\nthree-year\nperformance period, taking into account an estimated forfeiture rate, regardless of whether the market condition is satisfied, provided that the requisite service period has been completed. Performance will be determined by comparing Nasdaq’s TSR to\ntwo\npeer groups, each weighted\n50.0\n%. The first peer group consists of exchange companies, and the second peer group consists of all companies in the S&P 500. Nasdaq’s relative performance ranking against each of these groups will determine the final number of shares delivered to each individual under the program. The award issuance under this program will be between\n0.0\n% and\n200.0\n% of the number of PSUs granted and will be determined by Nasdaq’s overall performance against both peer groups. However, if Nasdaq’s TSR is negative for the\nthree-year\nperformance period, regardless of TSR ranking, the award issuance will not exceed\n100.0\n% of the number of PSUs granted. We estimate the fair value of PSUs granted under the\nthree-year\nPSU program using the Monte Carlo simulation model, as these awards contain a market condition.\nF-31\nGrants of PSUs that were issued in 2019 with a\nthree-year\nperformance period exceeded the applicable performance parameters. As a result, an additional\n289,307\nunits above the original target were granted in the first quarter of 2022 and were fully vested upon issuance.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine the weighted-average fair values of the PSU awards granted under the\nthree-year\nPSU program for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nIn the table above:\n•\nThe risk-free interest rate for periods within the expected life of the award is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant; and\n•\nWe use historic volatility for PSU awards issued under the\nthree-year\nPSU program, as implied volatility data could not be obtained for all the companies in the peer groups used for relative performance measurement within the program.\nIn addition, the annual dividend assumption utilized in the Monte Carlo simulation model is based on Nasdaq’s dividend yield at the date of grant.\nSummary of PSU Activity\nThe following table summarizes our PSU activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nIn the table above, the granted amount includes additional awards granted based on overachievement of performance parameters as well as target awards.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $\n1\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to the\none-year\nPSU program is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.0\nyear. For the\nthree-year\nPSU program, $\n43\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.4\nyears.\nF-32\nStock Options\nA summary of stock option activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe net cash proceeds from the exercise of\n24,409\nstock options for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n1\nmillion. The net cash proceeds from the exercise of\n85,195\nstock options for the year ended December 31, 2020 was $\n2\nmillion. The net cash proceeds from the exercise of\n69,699\nstock options for the year ended December 31, 2019 was $\n2\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the aggregate pre-tax intrinsic value of the outstanding and exercisable stock options in the above table was $\n39\nmillion and represents the difference between our closing stock price on December 31, 2021 of $\n210.01\nand the exercise price, times the number of shares, which would have been received by the option holders had the option holders exercised their stock options on that date. This amount can change based on the fair market value of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, the weighted-average remaining contractual term of the outstanding and exercisable stock options included in the above table was\n5.0\nyears.\nThe total pre-tax intrinsic value of stock options exercised was $\n3\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, $\n9\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n6\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nESPP\nWe have an ESPP under which approximately\n4.2\nmillion shares of our common stock were available for future issuance as of December 31, 2021. Under our ESPP, employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding\n10.0\n% of their annual compensation, subject to applicable annual Internal Revenue Service limitations. We record compensation expense related to the\n15.0\n% discount that is given to our employees.\nThe following table summarizes employee activity and expense associated with the ESPP for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n12.\nNASDAQ\nSTOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nAs of December 31, 2021,\n300,000,000\nshares of our common stock were authorized,\n173,418,939\nshares were issued and\n166,679,635\nshares were outstanding. As of December 31, 2020,\n300,000,000\nshares of our common stock were authorized,\n171,278,761\nshares were issued and\n164,933,678\nshares were outstanding. The holders of common stock are entitled to\none\nvote per share, except that our certificate of incorporation limits the ability of any shareholder to vote in excess of\n5.0\n% of the then-outstanding shares of Nasdaq common stock.\nCommon Stock in Treasury, at Cost\nWe account for the purchase of treasury stock under the cost method with the shares of stock repurchased reflected as a reduction to Nasdaq stockholders’ equity and included in common stock in treasury, at cost in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Shares repurchased under our share repurchase program are currently retired and canceled and are therefore not included in the common stock in treasury balance. If treasury shares are reissued, they are recorded at the average cost of the treasury shares acquired. We held\n6,739,304\nshares of common stock in treasury as of December 31, 2021 and\n6,345,083\nshares as of December 31, 2020, most of which are related to shares of our common stock withheld for the settlement of employee tax withholding obligations arising from the vesting of restricted stock and PSUs.\nF-33\nShare Repurchase Program\nAs discussed in “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” on June 16, 2021, our board of directors authorized an increase to our share repurchase program to an aggregate authorized amount of $\n1.5\nbillion. As of December 31, 2021, the remaining aggregate authorized amount under the existing share repurchase program was $\n926\nmillion.\nThese repurchases may be made from time to time at prevailing market prices in open market purchases, privately-negotiated transactions, block purchase techniques, an accelerated share repurchase program or otherwise, as determined by our management. The repurchases are primarily funded from existing cash balances. The share repurchase program may be suspended, modified or discontinued at any time, and has no defined expiration date.\nThe following is a summary of our share repurchase activity, excluding the repurchases done through our ASR agreement described below, reported based on settlement date, for the year ended December 31, 2021:\nIn the table above, the number of shares of common stock repurchased excludes an aggregate of\n394,221\nshares withheld upon the vesting of restricted stock and PSUs for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nAs discussed above in “Common Stock in Treasury, at Cost,” shares repurchased under our share repurchase program are currently retired and cancelled.\nASR Agreements\nIn July 2021, we entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $\n475\nmillion of common stock. We received a total delivery of\n2,431,212\nshares of common stock and completed the ASR program during the fourth quarter of 2021. The ASR agreement was entered into pursuant to our $\n1.5\nbillion share repurchase authorization as discussed in \"Share Repurchase Program,\" above.\nOn January 26, 2022 we announced that we entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $\n325\nmillion of common stock and received an initial delivery of\n1,533,923\nshares of common stock. The final number of shares to be repurchased will be based on the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common stock during the term of the ASR agreement, less a discount and subject to adjustments pursuant to the terms of the ASR agreement. The final settlement of the ASR agreement is expected to be completed in the first quarter of 2022. At settlement, our counterparty may be required to deliver additional shares of common stock to us, or, under certain circumstances, we may be required to deliver shares of our common stock or may elect to make a cash payment to our counterparty.\nPreferred Stock\nOur certificate of incorporation authorizes the issuance of\n30,000,000\nshares of preferred stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, issuable from time to time in one or more series. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020,\nno\nshares of preferred stock were issued or outstanding.\nCash Dividends on Common Stock\nDuring 2021, our board of directors declared and paid the following cash dividends:\nThe total amount paid of $\n350\nmillion was recorded in retained earnings within Nasdaq's stockholders' equity in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at December 31, 2021.\nIn January 2022, the board of directors approved a regular quarterly cash dividend of $\n0.54\nper share on our outstanding common stock. The dividend is payable on March 25, 2022 to shareholders of record at the close of business on March 11, 2022. The estimated amount of this dividend is $\n90\nmillion. Future declarations of quarterly dividends and the establishment of future record and payment dates are subject to approval by the board of directors.\nThe board of directors maintains a dividend policy with the intention to provide stockholders with regular and increasing dividends as earnings and cash flows increase.\nF-34\n13.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share:\nIn the tables above:\n•\nEmployee equity awards from our PSU program, which are considered contingently issuable, are included in the computation of dilutive earnings per share on a weighted average basis when management determines that the applicable performance criteria would have been met if the performance period ended as of the date of the relevant computation.\n•\nFor the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, the contingent issuance of common stock was related to a contingent obligation associated with a business we sold in June 2021. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” for further discussion.\nSecurities that were\nnot\nincluded in the computation of diluted earnings per share because their effect was antidilutive were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n14.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following tables present our financial assets and financial liabilities that were measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nFinancial Instruments Not Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nSome of our financial instruments are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis but are recorded at amounts that approximate fair value due to their liquid or short-term nature. Such financial assets and financial liabilities include: cash and cash equivalents, restricted cash and cash equivalents, receivables, net, certain other current assets, accounts payable and accrued expenses, Section 31 fees payable to SEC, accrued personnel costs, commercial paper and certain other current liabilities.\nOur investment in OCC is accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have elected the measurement alternative for the majority of our equity securities, which primarily represent various strategic investments made through our corporate venture program. See “Equity Method Investments,” and “Equity Securities,” of Note 6, “Investments,” for further discussion.\nF-35\nWe also consider our debt obligations to be financial instruments. As of December 31, 2021, the majority of our debt obligations were fixed-rate obligations. We are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility, as the interest rates on this facility have a variable rate depending on the maturity of the borrowing and the implied underlying reference rate. As of December 31, 2021, we had\nno\noutstanding borrowings under our 2020 Credit Facility. We are also exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of the amounts outstanding from the sale of commercial paper under our commercial paper program. The fair value of our debt obligations utilizing discounted cash flow analyses for our floating rate debt, and prevailing market rates for our fixed rate debt was $\n5.9\nbillion as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. The discounted cash flow analyses are based on borrowing rates currently available to us for debt with similar terms and maturities. The fair value of our commercial paper as of December 31, 2021 approximated the carrying value since the rates of interest on this short-term debt approximated market rates. Our commercial paper and our fixed rate and floating rate debt are categorized as Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy.\nFor further discussion of our debt obligations, see Note 9, “Debt Obligations.”\nNon-Financial Assets Measured at Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis\nOur non-financial assets, which include goodwill, intangible assets, and other long-lived assets, are not required to be carried at fair value on a recurring basis. Fair value measures of non-financial assets are primarily used in the impairment analysis of these assets. Any resulting asset impairment would require that the non-financial asset be recorded at its fair value. Nasdaq uses Level 3 inputs to measure the fair value of the above assets on a non-recurring basis. As of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, there were\nno\nnon-financial assets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis.\n15.\nCLEARING OPERATIONS\nNasdaq\nClearing\nNasdaq Clearing is authorized and supervised under EMIR as a multi-asset clearinghouse by the SFSA. Such authorization is effective for all member states of the European Union and certain other non-member states that are part of the European Economic Area, including Norway. The clearinghouse acts as the CCP for exchange and OTC trades in equity derivatives, fixed income derivatives, resale and repurchase contracts, power derivatives, emission allowance derivatives, and seafood derivatives.\nThrough our clearing operations in the financial markets, which include the resale and repurchase market, the commodities markets, and the seafood market, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for, and guarantees the fulfillment of, each contract cleared. These contracts are not used by Nasdaq Clearing for the purpose of trading on its own behalf. As the legal counterparty of each transaction, Nasdaq Clearing bears the counterparty risk between the purchaser and seller in the contract. In its guarantor role, Nasdaq Clearing has precisely equal and offsetting claims to and from clearing members on opposite sides of each contract, standing as the CCP on every contract cleared. In accordance with the rules and regulations of Nasdaq Clearing, default fund and margin collateral requirements are calculated for each clearing member’s positions in accounts with the CCP. See “Default Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits” below for further discussion of Nasdaq Clearing’s default fund and margin requirements.\nNasdaq Clearing maintains\nthree\nmember sponsored default funds: one related to financial markets, one related to commodities markets and one related to the seafood market. Under this structure, Nasdaq Clearing and its clearing members must contribute to the total regulatory capital related to the clearing operations of Nasdaq Clearing. This structure applies an initial separation of default fund contributions for the financial, commodities and seafood markets in order to create a buffer for each market’s counterparty risks. As of September 1, 2021, the mutualized default fund has been eliminated and the default fund structure is fully segregated. See “Default Fund Contributions” below for further discussion of Nasdaq Clearing’s default fund. A power of assessment and a liability waterfall have also been implemented to further align risk between Nasdaq Clearing and its clearing members. See “Power of Assessment” and “Liability Waterfall” below for further discussion.\nNasdaq Commodities Clearing Default\nIn September 2018, a member of the Nasdaq Clearing commodities market defaulted due to the inability to post sufficient collateral to cover increased margin requirements for the positions of the relevant member, which had experienced losses due to sharp adverse movements in the Nordic - German power market spread. Nasdaq Clearing followed default procedures and offset the future market risk on the defaulting member’s positions.\nImmediately following the event, Nasdaq Clearing launched a comprehensive enhancement program to strengthen the resilience and robustness of the clearinghouse.\nF-36\nIn December 2018, the SFSA initiated a review of Nasdaq Clearing. In January 2021, the SFSA issued a warning combined with an administrative fine of approximately $\n33\nmillion (SEK\n300\nmillion) to Nasdaq Clearing based on its review. Nasdaq Clearing appealed the SFSA´s decision to the Administrative Court. In December 2021, the court rejected Nasdaq Clearing’s appeal and upheld the decision of the SFSA. In January 2022, Nasdaq Clearing appealed this decision to the Administrative Court of Appeal. While we continue to firmly believe in the merit of our appeal, due to the recent decision by the Administrative Court, we have determined it is appropriate to record an accrual for the full amount of the administrative fine issued by the SFSA. The charge is included in regulatory expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDefault Fund Contributions and Margin Deposits\nAs of December 31, 2021, clearing member default fund contributions and margin deposits were as follows:\nOf the total default fund contributions of $\n880\nmillion, Nasdaq Clearing can utilize $\n804\nmillion as capital resources in the event of a counterparty default. The remaining balance of $\n76\nmillion pertains to member posted surplus balances.\nOur clearinghouse holds material amounts of clearing member cash deposits which are held or invested primarily to provide security of capital while minimizing credit, market and liquidity risks. While we seek to achieve a reasonable rate of return, we are primarily concerned with preservation of capital and managing the risks associated with these deposits.\nClearing member cash contributions are maintained in demand deposits held at central banks and large, highly rated financial institutions or secured through direct investments, primarily central bank certificates and highly rated European government debt securities with original maturities primarily 1 year or less, reverse repurchase agreements and multilateral development bank debt securities. Investments in reverse repurchase agreements range in maturity from\n4\ndays to\n14\ndays and are secured with highly rated government securities. The carrying value of these securities approximates their fair value due to the short-term nature of the instruments and reverse repurchase agreements.\nNasdaq Clearing has invested the total cash contributions of $\n5,911\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n3,942\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, in accordance with its investment policy as follows:\nIn the table above the change from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 includes currency translation adjustments of $\n321\nmillion for restricted cash and cash equivalents and $\n40\nmillion for investments.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 investments related to default funds and margin deposits, net includes purchases of investment securities of $(\n41,098\n) million, $(\n54,046\n) million and $(\n38,203\n) million, respectively, and proceeds from sales and redemptions of investment securities of $\n40,966\nmillion, $\n54,155\nmillion and $\n38,029\nmillion, respectively.\nIn the investment activity related to default fund and margin contributions, we are exposed to counterparty risk related to reverse repurchase agreement transactions, which reflect the risk that the counterparty might become insolvent and, thus, fail to meet its obligations to Nasdaq Clearing. We mitigate this risk by only engaging in transactions with high credit quality reverse repurchase agreement counterparties and by limiting the acceptable collateral under the reverse repurchase agreement to high quality issuers, primarily government securities and other securities explicitly guaranteed by a government. The value of the underlying security is monitored during the lifetime of the contract, and in the event the market value of the underlying security falls below the reverse repurchase amount, our clearinghouse may require additional collateral or a reset of the contract.\nDefault Fund Contributions\nRequired contributions to the default funds are proportional to the exposures of each clearing member. When a clearing member is active in more than one market, contributions must be made to all markets’ default funds in which the member is active. Clearing members’ eligible contributions may include cash and non-cash contributions. Cash contributions received are maintained in demand deposits held at central banks and large, highly rated financial institutions or invested by Nasdaq Clearing, in accordance\nF-37\nwith its investment policy, either in central bank certificates, highly rated government debt securities, reverse repurchase agreements with highly rated government debt securities as collateral, or multilateral development bank debt securities. Nasdaq Clearing maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin collateral. All risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to Nasdaq Clearing. Clearing members’ cash contributions are included in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. Non-cash contributions include highly rated government debt securities that must meet specific criteria approved by Nasdaq Clearing. Non-cash contributions are pledged assets that are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as Nasdaq Clearing does not take legal ownership of these assets and the risks and rewards remain with the clearing members. These balances may fluctuate over time due to changes in the amount of deposits required and whether members choose to provide cash or non-cash contributions. Assets pledged are held at a nominee account in Nasdaq Clearing’s name for the benefit of the clearing members and are immediately accessible by Nasdaq Clearing in the event of a default. In addition to clearing members’ required contributions to the liability waterfall, Nasdaq Clearing is also required to contribute capital to the liability waterfall and overall regulatory capital as specified under its clearinghouse rules. As of December 31, 2021, Nasdaq Clearing committed capital totaling $\n138\nmillion to the liability waterfall and overall regulatory capital, in the form of government debt securities, which are recorded as financial investments in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The combined regulatory capital of the clearing members and Nasdaq Clearing is intended to secure the obligations of a clearing member exceeding such member’s own margin and default fund deposits and may be used to cover losses sustained by a clearing member in the event of a default.\nMargin Deposits\nNasdaq Clearing requires all clearing members to provide collateral, which may consist of cash and non-cash contributions, to guarantee performance on the clearing members’ open positions, or initial margin. In addition, clearing members must also provide collateral to cover the daily margin call if needed. See “Default Fund Contributions” above for further discussion of cash and non-cash contributions.\nSimilar to default fund contributions, Nasdaq Clearing maintains and manages all cash deposits related to margin collateral. All risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to Nasdaq Clearing and are recorded in revenues. These cash deposits are recorded in default funds and margin deposits in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as both a current asset and a current liability. Pledged margin collateral is not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets as all risks and rewards of collateral ownership, including interest, belong to the counterparty. Assets pledged are held at a nominee account in Nasdaq Clearing’s name for the benefit of the clearing members and\nare immediately accessible by Nasdaq Clearing in the event of a default.\nNasdaq Clearing marks to market all outstanding contracts and requires payment from clearing members whose positions have lost value. The mark-to-market process helps identify any clearing members that may not be able to satisfy their financial obligations in a timely manner allowing Nasdaq Clearing the ability to mitigate the risk of a clearing member defaulting due to exceptionally large losses. In the event of a default, Nasdaq Clearing can access the defaulting member’s margin and default fund deposits to cover the defaulting member’s losses.\nRegulatory Capital and Risk Management Calculations\nNasdaq Clearing manages risk through a comprehensive counterparty risk management framework, which is comprised of policies, procedures, standards and financial resources. The level of regulatory capital is determined in accordance with Nasdaq Clearing’s regulatory capital and default fund policy, as approved by the SFSA. Regulatory capital calculations are continuously updated through a proprietary capital-at-risk calculation model that establishes the appropriate level of capital.\nAs mentioned above, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for each contract cleared and thereby guarantees the fulfillment of each contract. Nasdaq Clearing accounts for this guarantee as a performance guarantee. We determine the fair value of the performance guarantee by considering daily settlement of contracts and other margining and default fund requirements, the risk management program, historical evidence of default payments, and the estimated probability of potential default payouts. The calculation is determined using proprietary risk management software that simulates gains and losses based on historical market prices, extreme but plausible market scenarios, volatility and other factors present at that point in time for those particular unsettled contracts. Based on this analysis, excluding any liability related to the Nasdaq commodities clearing default (see discussion above), the estimated liability was nominal and\nno\nliability was recorded as of December 31, 2021.\nPower of Assessment\nTo further strengthen the contingent financial resources of the clearinghouse, Nasdaq Clearing has power of assessment that provides the ability to collect additional funds from its clearing members to cover a defaulting member’s remaining obligations up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules. The power of assessment corresponds to\n230.0\n% of the clearing member’s aggregate contribution to the financial, commodities and seafood markets’ default funds.\nLiability Waterfall\nThe liability waterfall is the priority order in which the capital resources would be utilized in the event of a default where the defaulting clearing member’s collateral would not be sufficient to cover the cost to settle its portfolio. If a default occurs and the defaulting clearing member’s\nF-38\ncollateral, including cash deposits and pledged assets, is depleted, then capital is utilized in the following amount and order:\n•\njunior capital contributed by Nasdaq Clearing, which totaled $\n44\nmillion as of December 31, 2021;\n•\na loss-sharing pool related only to the financial market that is contributed to by clearing members and only applies if the defaulting member’s portfolio includes interest rate swap products;\n•\nspecific market default fund where the loss occurred (i.e., the financial, commodities, or seafood market), which includes capital contributions of the clearing members on a pro-rata basis; and\n•\nfully segregated senior capital for each specific market contributed by Nasdaq Clearing, calculated in accordance with clearinghouse rules, which totaled $\n24\nmillion as of December 31, 2021.\nIf additional funds are needed after utilization of the liability waterfall, or if part of the waterfall has been utilized and needs to be replenished, then Nasdaq Clearing will utilize its power of assessment and additional capital contributions will be required by non-defaulting members up to the limits established under the terms of the clearinghouse rules.\nIn addition to the capital held to withstand counterparty defaults described above, Nasdaq Clearing also has committed capital of $\n70\nmillion to ensure that it can handle an orderly wind-down of its operation, and that it is adequately protected against investment, operational, legal, and business risks.\nMarket Value of Derivative Contracts Outstanding\nThe following table presents the market value of derivative contracts outstanding prior to netting:\nIn the table above:\n•\nWe determined the fair value of our option contracts using standard valuation models that were based on market-based observable inputs including implied volatility, interest rates and the spot price of the underlying instrument.\n•\nWe determined the fair value of our futures contracts based upon quoted market prices and average quoted market yields.\n•\nWe determined the fair value of our forward contracts using standard valuation models that were based on\nmarket-based observable inputs including benchmark rates and the spot price of the underlying instrument.\nDerivative Contracts Cleared\nThe following table presents the total number of derivative contracts cleared through Nasdaq Clearing for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nIn the table above, the total volume in cleared power related to commodity contracts was\n813\nTerawatt hours (TWh) and\n956\nTWh for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResale and Repurchase Agreements Contracts Outstanding and Cleared\nThe outstanding contract value of resale and repurchase agreements was $\n139\nmillion and $\n253\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The total number of resale and repurchase agreements contracts cleared was\n6,070,414\nand\n4,832,504\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively .\n16.\nLEASES\nWe have operating leases which are primarily real estate leases predominantly for our U.S. and European headquarters and for general office space.\nThe following table provides supplemental balance sheet information related to Nasdaq's operating leases:\nF-39\nThe following table summarizes Nasdaq's lease cost:\nIn the table above, operating lease costs include short-term lease cost, which was immaterial.\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for ea\nch of the first five years and total of the remaining years to the operating lease liabilities recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nIn the table above, interest is calculated using the interest rate for each lease. Present value of lease liabilities include the current portion of $\n37\nmillion.\nTotal lease payments in the table above exclude $\n168\nmillion of legally binding minimum lease payments for a\nten\nyear lease signed but not yet commenced.\nThe following table provides information related to Nasdaq's lease term and discount rate:\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow information related to Nasdaq's operating leases:\n17.\nINCOME TAXES\nIncome\nBefore Income Tax Provision\nThe following table presents the domestic and foreign components of income before income tax provision:\nIncome Tax Provision\nThe income tax provision consists of the following amounts:\nWe have determined that undistributed earnings of certain non-U.S. subsidiaries will be reinvested for an indefinite period of time. We have both the intent and ability to indefinitely reinvest these earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the cumulative amount of undistributed earnings in these subsidiaries is $\n286\nmillion. Given our intent and ability to reinvest these earnings for an indefinite period of time, we have not accrued a deferred tax liability on these earnings. A determination of an unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these earnings is not practicable.\nF-40\nA reconciliation of the income tax provision, based on the U.S. federal statutory rate, to our actual income tax provision for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nThe majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2021 compared to 2020 was due to a tax benefit related to federal, state and local provision to return adjustments, which is included in “Other, net” in the table above. The majority of the decrease in our effective tax rate in 2020 compared to 2019 was the result of favorable audit settlements and remeasurement of our deferred inventory, which is included in “Other, net” in the table above.\nThe effective tax rate may vary from period to period depending on, among other factors, the geographic and business mix of earnings and losses. These same and other factors, including history of pre-tax earnings and losses, are taken into account in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets.\nDeferred Income Taxes\nThe temporary differences, which give rise to our deferred tax assets and (liabilities), consisted of the following:\nIn the table above, non-current deferred tax assets are included in other non-current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized a valuation allowance of $\n4\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion, respectively, due to recurring operating losses in a foreign jurisdiction. Based on all available positive and negative evidence, we believe the sources of future taxable income are sufficient to realize the remainder of Nasdaq's deferred tax asset inventory.\nF-41\nNasdaq has deferred tax assets associated with NOLs in U.S. state and local and non-U.S. jurisdictions with the following expiration dates:\nUnrecognized Tax Benefits\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nWe had $\n57\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits as of December 31, 2021, $\n42\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, and $\n48\nmillion as of December 31, 2019 which, if recognized in the future, would affect our effective tax rate. Nasdaq does not believe that our unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next 12 months.\nWe recognize interest and/or penalties related to income tax matters in the provision for income taxes in our Consolidated Statements of Income, which was a $\n2\nmillion tax benefit for both the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, and a tax provision of $\n3\nmillion for 2019. Accrued interest and penalties, net of tax effect were $\n4\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n8\nmillion as of December 31, 2020.\nTax Audits\nNasdaq and its eligible subsidiaries file a consolidated U.S. federal income tax return and applicable state and local income tax returns and non-U.S. income tax returns. We are subject to examination by federal, state and local, and foreign tax authorities. Our Federal income tax return for the years 2018 through 2020 is subject to examination by the Internal Revenue Service. Several state tax returns are currently under examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2012 through 2019. Non-U.S. tax returns are subject to examination by the respective tax authorities for the years 2015 through 2020. We regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments by each jurisdiction and have established tax reserves that we believe are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Examination outcomes and the timing of examination settlements are subject to uncertainty. Although the results of\nsuch examinations may have an impact on our unrecognized tax benefits, we do not anticipate that such impact will be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations. We do not expect to settle any material tax audits in the next twelve months.\n18.\nCOMMITMENTS, CONTINGENCIES AND GUARANTEES\nGuarantees Issued and Credit Facilities Available\nIn addition to the default fund contributions and margin collateral pledged by clearing members discussed in Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” we have obtained financial guarantees and credit facilities, which are guaranteed by us through counter indemnities, to provide further liquidity related to our clearing businesses. Financial guarantees issued to us totaled $\n5\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020. As discussed in “Other Credit Facilities,” of Note 9, “Debt Obligations,” we also have credit facilities primarily related to our Nasdaq Clearing operations, which are available in multiple currencies, and totaled $\n212\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n232\nmillion as of December 31, 2020 in available liquidity,\nnone\nof which was utilized.\nOther Guarantees\nThrough our clearing operations in the financial markets, Nasdaq Clearing is the legal counterparty for, and guarantees the performance of, its clearing members. See Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” for further discussion of Nasdaq Clearing performance guarantees.\nWe have provided a guarantee related to lease obligations for The Nasdaq Entrepreneurial Center, Inc., which is a not-for-profit organization designed to convene, connect and engage aspiring and current entrepreneurs. This entity is not included in the consolidated financial statements of Nasdaq.\nWe believe that the potential for us to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for the above guarantees.\nRouting Brokerage Activities\nOne of our broker-dealer subsidiaries, Nasdaq Execution Services, provides a guarantee to securities clearinghouses and exchanges under its standard membership agreements, which require members to guarantee the performance of other members. If a member becomes unable to satisfy its obligations to a clearinghouse or exchange, other members would be required to meet its shortfalls. To mitigate these performance risks, the exchanges and clearinghouses often require members to post collateral, as well as meet certain minimum financial standards. Nasdaq Execution Services’ maximum potential liability under these arrangements cannot be quantified. However, we believe that the potential for Nasdaq Execution Services to be required to make payments under these arrangements is unlikely. Accordingly, no contingent liability is recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for these arrangements.\nF-42\nLegal and Regulatory Matters\nLitigation\nAs previously disclosed, we are named as one of many defendants in City of Providence v. BATS Global Markets, Inc., et al., 14 Civ. 2811 (S.D.N.Y.), which was filed on April 18, 2014 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. The district court appointed lead counsel, who filed an amended complaint on September 2, 2014. The amended complaint names as defendants\nseven\nnational exchanges, as well as Barclays PLC, which operated a private ATS. On behalf of a putative class of securities traders, the plaintiffs allege that the defendants engaged in a scheme to manipulate the markets through high-frequency trading; the amended complaint asserts claims against us under Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5, as well as under Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act. The plaintiffs seek injunctive and monetary relief of an unspecified amount. We filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint on November 3, 2014. In response, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on November 24, 2014, which names the same defendants and alleges essentially the same violations. We then filed a motion to dismiss the second amended complaint on January 23, 2015. On August 26, 2015, the district court entered an order dismissing the second amended complaint in its entirety. The plaintiffs appealed the judgment of dismissal to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit (although opting not to appeal the dismissal with respect to Barclays PLC or the dismissal of claims under Section 6(b) of the Exchange Act). On December 19, 2017, the Second Circuit issued an opinion vacating the district court’s judgment of dismissal and remanding to the district court for further proceedings. On May 18, 2018, the exchanges filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint, raising issues not addressed in the proceedings to date. On May 28, 2019, the district court denied the exchanges’ renewed motion to dismiss, leading the parties to commence the discovery process. Discovery, focused on issues of whether the case can be certified as a class action and whether the plaintiffs’ claims are precluded by federal securities regulation, ended on April 26, 2021, and potentially dispositive motions regarding these issues were filed on May 28, 2021. Given the preliminary nature of the proceedings, we are unable to estimate what, if any, liability may result from this litigation. However, we believe that the claims are without merit and will continue to litigate vigorously.\nArmenian Stock Exchange Investigation\nAs disclosed in our prior filings with the SEC, a former non-U.S. subsidiary of Nasdaq, NASDAQ OMX Armenia OJSC, operated the Armenian Stock Exchange and the Central Depository of Armenia, which are regulated by the Central Bank of Armenia under Armenian law. In accordance with the requirements of Armenian law, Mellat Bank SB CJSC, an Armenian entity that is designated under Executive Order 13382, was a market participant on the Armenian Stock Exchange and, as a result, paid participation and transaction fees to the Armenian Stock Exchange during the period from 2012-2014. In 2014, we voluntarily self-disclosed this matter to the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, or OFAC, and received authorization from OFAC to continue, if necessary, certain activities pertaining to Mellat Bank SB CJSC in Armenia in a limited manner. In 2015, Nasdaq sold a majority of its ownership of Nasdaq OMX Armenia OJSC, with the remaining minority interest sold in 2018.\nOFAC has been conducting an inquiry into the Armenian Stock Exchange matter described above and in our prior filings since 2016, and during the first quarter of 2021, we were advised that OFAC is considering a civil monetary penalty in connection with that matter. We are currently in discussions with OFAC.\nWhile we believe our decision to voluntarily self-report this issue and our continued cooperation with OFAC, along with the permit we received from OFAC in connection with our transactions involving the Armenian Stock Exchange, will be mitigating factors with respect to the matter, any monetary fines or restrictions may nonetheless be material to our financial results in the period in which they are imposed. We cannot currently predict when our discussions with OFAC will conclude or the amount of any potential penalties imposed. Accordingly, we are unable to reasonably estimate any potential loss or range of loss and we have not accrued for a loss contingency.\nNasdaq Commodities Clearing Default\nIn December 2021, we recorded a charge related to an administrative fine issued by the SFSA associated with the default which occurred in 2018. The charge is included in regulatory expense in our Consolidated Statements of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021. See “Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default,” of Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” for further information.\nOther Matters\nExcept as disclosed above and in prior reports filed under the Exchange Act, we are not currently a party to any litigation or proceeding that we believe could have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial condition, or operating results. However, from time to time, we have been threatened with, or named as a defendant in, lawsuits or involved in regulatory proceedings.\nF-43\nIn the normal course of business, Nasdaq discusses matters with its regulators raised during regulatory examinations or otherwise subject to their inquiries. Management believes that censures, fines, penalties or other sanctions that could result from any ongoing examinations or inquiries will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial position or results of operations. However, we are unable to predict the outcome or the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters, or the potential fines, penalties or injunctive or other equitable relief, if any, that may result from these matters.\nTax Audits\nWe are engaged in ongoing discussions and audits with taxing authorities on various tax matters, the resolutions of which are uncertain. Currently, there are matters that may lead to assessments, some of which may not be resolved for several years. Based on currently available information, we believe we have adequately provided for any assessments that could result from those proceedings where it is more likely than not that we will be assessed. We review our positions on these matters as they progress. See “Tax Audits,” of Note 17, “Income Taxes,” for further discussion.\n19.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nWe manage, operate and provide our products and services in\nfour\nbusiness segments: Market Technology, Investment Intelligence, Corporate Platforms and Market Services. See Note 1, “Organization and Nature of Operations,” for further discussion of our reportable segments.\nOur management allocates resources, assesses performance and manages these businesses as\nfour\nseparate segments. We evaluate the performance of our segments based on several factors, of which the primary financial measure is operating income. Results of individual businesses are presented based on our management accounting practices and structure. Our chief operating decision maker does not review total assets or statements of income below operating income by segments as key performance metrics; therefore, such information is not presented below.\nThe following table presents certain information regarding our business segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nF-44\nCertain amounts are allocated to corporate items in our management reports as we believe they do not contribute to a meaningful evaluation of a particular segment's ongoing operating performance. These items, which are presented in the table below, include the following:\n•\nAmortization expense of acquired intangible assets:\nWe amortize intangible assets acquired in connection with various acquisitions. Intangible asset amortization expense can vary from period to period due to episodic acquisitions completed, rather than from our ongoing business operations. As such, if intangible asset amortization is included in performance measures, it is more difficult to assess the day-to-day operating performance of the segments, and the relative operating performance of the segments between periods. Management does not consider intangible asset amortization expense for the purpose of evaluating the performance of our segments or their managers or when making decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding intangible asset amortization expense provide management with a useful representation of our segments' ongoing activity in each period.\n•\nMerger and strategic initiatives expense:\nWe have pursued various strategic initiatives and completed acquisitions and divestitures in recent years that have resulted in expenses which would not have otherwise been incurred. These expenses generally include integration costs, as well as legal, due diligence and other third party transaction costs. The frequency and the amount of such expenses vary significantly based on the size, timing and complexity of the transaction. Management does not consider merger and strategic initiatives expense for the purpose of evaluating the performance of our segments or their managers or when making decisions to allocate resources. Therefore, we believe performance measures excluding merger and strategic initiatives expense provide management with a useful representation of our segments' ongoing activity in each period.\n•\nRestructuring charges:\nWe initiated the transition of certain technology platforms to advance our strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continue the re-alignment of certain business areas. See Note 20, “Restructuring Charges,” for further discussion of our 2019 restructuring plan. We believe performance measures excluding restructuring charges provide management with a useful representation of our segments' ongoing activity in each period.\n•\nRevenues and expenses - divested/contributed businesses:\nWe have included in corporate items the revenues and expenses of our U.S. Fixed Income business, which was previously included in our Market Services and Investment Intelligence results. See “2021 Divestiture,” of Note 4, “Acquisitions and Divestiture,” for further discussion of this divestiture. Also included are the revenues and expenses associated with the NPM business which we contributed to a standalone, independent company, of which we own the largest minority interest, together with a consortium of third party financial institutions in July 2021. Prior to July these revenues were previously included in our Corporate Platforms results. For 2019, we have included in corporate items the revenues and expenses of the BWise business which was part of the IR & ESG Services business within our Corporate Platforms segment as BWise was sold in March 2019.\n•\nOther significant items:\nWe have included certain other charges or gains in corporate items, to the extent we believe they should be excluded when evaluating the ongoing operating performance of each individual segment. Other significant items include:\n◦\nfor the year ended December 31, 2021 a charge related to an administrative fine imposed by the SFSA associated with the default that occurred in 2018, see “Nasdaq Commodities Clearing Default,” of Note 15, “Clearing Operations,” for further discussion, and for the year ended December 31, 2020 the reversal of a regulatory fine issued by the SFSA. Both charges have been included in regulatory expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income;\n◦\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020, a provision for notes receivable associated with the funding of technology development for the consolidated audit trail;\n◦\nfor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, a charge on extinguishment of debt;\n◦\nfor the year ended December 31, 2020, charitable donations made to the Nasdaq Foundation, COVID-19 response and relief efforts, and social justice charities; and\n◦\nfor the years ended December 31, 2020, certain litigation costs which are recorded in professional and contract services expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe above charges are recorded in general, administrative and other expense, unless otherwise noted, in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nF-45\nThe following table summarizes our Corporate Items:\nFor further discussion of our segments’ results, see “Segment Operating Results,” of “Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.”\nGeographic Data\nThe following table presents total revenues and property and equipment, net by geographic area for 2021, 2020 and 2019. Revenues are classified based upon the location of the customer. Property and equipment information is based on the physical location of the assets.\nOur property and equipment, net for all other countries primarily includes assets held in Sweden. No single customer accounted for 10.0% or more of our revenues in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n20.\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nIn September 2019, we initiated the transition of certain technology platforms to advance the company's strategic opportunities as a technology and analytics provider and continue the re-alignment of certain business areas. In connection with these restructuring efforts, we retired certain elements of our marketplace infrastructure and technology product offerings as we implement NFF and other technologies internally and externally. This represented a fundamental shift in our strategy and technology as well as executive re-alignment. In June 2021, we completed our 2019 restructuring plan and recognized total pre-tax charges of $\n118\nmillion over a\ntwo-year\nperiod. Total pre-tax charges related primarily to non-cash items such as asset impairments and accelerated depreciation, and third-party consulting costs. Severance and employee-related charges were also incurred.\nThe following table presents a summary of the 2019 restructuring plan charges in the Consolidated Statements of Income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 which primarily consisted of consulting services, asset impairment charges primarily related to capitalized software that was retired, and accelerated depreciation expense on certain assets as a result of a decrease in their useful life.\n21.\nSubsequent Event\nIn January 2022, we entered into an ASR agreement to repurchase $\n325\nmillion of common stock. Refer to “ASR Agreements,” of Note 12, “Nasdaq Stockholders' Equity,” for further discussion.\nF-46"
