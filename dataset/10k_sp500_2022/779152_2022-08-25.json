    "text": "Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. (\"JKHY\") is a well-rounded financial technology company. JKHY was founded in 1976 as a provider of core information processing solutions for banks. Today, the Company’s extensive array of products and services includes processing transactions, automating business processes, and managing information for over 7,800 financial institutions and diverse corporate entities.\nJKHY provides its products and services primarily to financial institutions:\n•\nCore bank integrated data processing systems are provided to over 950 banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets of up to $50 billion. The number of banks we serve has decreased in the last year due to acquisitions and mergers within the banking industry, which are discussed further under the heading \"Industry Background\" in this Item 1. Our banking solutions support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments with three functionally distinct core processing platforms and more than 140 integrated complementary solutions.\n•\nCore credit union data processing solutions are provided to credit unions of all sizes, with a growing client base of nearly 720 credit union customers. There is one flagship core processing platform and more than 100 integrated complementary solutions that support both on-premise and private cloud operating environments.\n•\nNon-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services are also provided to financial institutions. There are more than 100 complementary solutions that offer highly specialized financial performance, imaging and payments processing, information security and risk management, retail delivery, and online and mobile solutions. These products and services enhance the performance of traditional financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and non-traditional diverse corporate entities with over 7,800 customers, comprised of nearly 1,650 of our core customers included in our bank and credit union customers listed above, as well as over 6,150 other non-core customers.\nOur products and services provide our customers with solutions that can be tailored to support their unique growth, service, operational, and performance goals. Our well-rounded solutions also enable financial institutions to offer the high-demand products and services required by their customers to compete more successfully, and to capitalize on evolving trends shaping the financial services industry.\nWe are committed to exceeding our customers’ service-related expectations. We measure and monitor customer satisfaction using annual surveys and randomly-generated online surveys initiated each day by routine support requests. We believe the results of this extensive survey process confirm that our service consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates excellent customer retention rates.\nWe also focus on establishing long-term customer relationships, continually expanding and strengthening those relationships with cross sales of additional products and services, earning new financial and non-financial clients, and ensuring our product offerings are highly competitive.\nThe majority of our revenue is derived from support and services provided by our private cloud services for our hosted customers that are typically on a seven-year or greater contract, recurring electronic payment solutions that are also generally on a contract term of seven years or greater, and to our on-premise customers that are typically on a one-year contract. Less predictable software license fees, paid by customers implementing our software solutions on-premise, and hardware sales, including all non-software products that we re-market in order to support our software systems, complement our primary revenue sources. Information regarding the classification of our business into four separate segments is set forth in Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements (see Item 8).\nJKHY’s progress and performance have been guided by the focused work ethic and fundamental ideals fostered by the Company’s founders 46 years ago:\n•\nDo the right thing\n•\nDo whatever it takes\n•\nHave fun\nWe recognize that our associates and their collective contribution are ultimately responsible for JKHY’s past, present, and future success. Recruiting and retaining high-quality employees is essential to our ongoing growth and financial performance, and we believe we have established an organizational culture that sustains high levels of employee engagement. For further discussion of our human capital considerations, see \"Human Capital\" below.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response\nSince its outbreak in early calendar 2020, COVID-19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern. The health, safety, and well-being of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us. In\n5\nMarch 2020, we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the COVID-19 situation and recommend Company actions. We offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work off-site, and we suspended all non-essential business travel. As of August 15, 2022, the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity. We have announced that our official return-to-office date is September 6, 2022, though employees have been permitted to voluntarily return to the office since May 2, 2022. Individual decisions on returning to the office will be manager-coordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments. A large number of our employees have requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and in-person working. While our business travel is normalizing, we do not expect it to return to pre-pandemic levels and continue to encourage a cautious approach to business travel activities.\nCustomers\nWe work closely with our customers who are scheduled for on-site visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site. Delays of customer system installations due to COVID-19 have been limited, and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available. We expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been limited, we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations. We believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business.\nFinancial impact\nDespite the changes and restrictions caused by COVID-19, the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity, balance sheet, and business trends remain strong. We experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2022, and we do not expect that to change in the near term. However, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of COVID-19 due to a number of uncertainties, including further government actions; the duration, severity and recurrence of the outbreak, including the onset of variants of the virus; the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants; the development and effectiveness of treatments; the effect on the economy generally; the potential impact to our customers, vendors, and employees; and how the potential impact might affect future customer services, processing and installation-related revenue, and processes and efficiencies within the Company directly or indirectly impacting financial results. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 and its possible impact on the Company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with COVID-19, see Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIndustry Background\nOur core banking solutions serve commercial banks and savings institutions with up to $50 billion in assets. According to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (“FDIC”), there were approximately 4,790 commercial banks and savings institutions in this asset range as of December 31, 2021, and we currently support over 950 of these banks with one of our three core information processing platform and complementary products and services.\nOur core credit union solutions serve credit unions of all asset sizes. According to the Credit Union National Association (“CUNA”), there were more than 5,000 domestic credit unions as of December 31, 2021, and we currently support nearly 720 of these credit unions with one flagship core information processing platform and complementary products and services.\nOur non-core solutions serve financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters and other diverse corporate entities. We currently support over 7,800 institutions with specialized solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security, mitigating operational risks, and controlling operating costs.\nThe FDIC reports the number of commercial banks and savings institutions declined 18% from the beginning of calendar year 2016 to the end of calendar year 2021, due mainly to mergers. Although the number of banks declined at a 4% compound annual rate during this period, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 9.0% and totaled $23.7 trillion as of December 31, 2021. There were nine new bank charters issued in calendar year 2021, compared to six in the 2020 calendar year. Comparing calendar years 2021 to 2020, the number of mergers decreased 2%.\nCUNA reports the number of credit unions declined 15% from the beginning of calendar year 2016 to the end of calendar year 2021. Although the number of credit unions declined at a 3% compound annual rate during this\n6\nperiod, aggregate assets increased at a compound annual rate of 10% and totaled $2.1 trillion as of December 31, 2021.\nCommunity and mid-tier banks and credit unions are important in the communities and to the consumers they serve. Bank customers and credit union members rely on these institutions to provide personalized, relationship-based service and competitive financial products and services available through the customer’s delivery channel of choice.  Institutions are recognizing that attracting and retaining customers and members in today’s highly competitive financial industry and realizing near-term and long-term performance goals are often technology dependent. Financial institutions must implement technological solutions that enable them to:\n•\nImplement e-commerce, mobile, and digital strategies that provide the convenience-driven services required in today’s financial services industry;\n•\nMaximize performance with accessible, accurate, and timely business intelligence information;\n•\nOffer the high-demand products and services needed to successfully compete with traditional competitors and non-traditional competitors created by convergence within the financial services industry;\n•\nEnhance the customer/member experience at varied points of contact;\n•\nExpand existing customer/member relationships and strengthen exit barriers by cross selling additional products and services;\n•\nCapitalize on new revenue and deposit growth opportunities;\n•\nIncrease operating efficiencies and reduce operating costs;\n•\nProtect mission-critical information assets and operational infrastructure;\n•\nProtect customers/members with various security tools from fraud and related financial losses;\n•\nMaximize the day-to-day use of technology and return on technology investments; and\n•\nEnsure full regulatory compliance.\nJKHY’s extensive product and service offerings enable diverse financial institutions to capitalize on these business opportunities and respond to these business challenges. We strive to establish a long-term, value-added technology partnership with each customer, and to continually expand our offerings with the specific solutions our customers need to prosper in the evolving financial services industry.\nMission Statement\nWe strengthen the connections between people and their financial institutions through technology and services that reduce the barriers to financial health.\nPurpose Statement\nTo empower people and communities to gain the financial freedom to move forward.\nBusiness Strategy\nOur fundamental business strategy is to generate organic revenue and earnings growth augmented by strategic acquisitions. We execute this strategy by:\n•\nProviding commercial banks and credit unions with core operating systems that provide excellent functionality and support on-premise and private cloud delivery environments with identical functionality.\n•\nExpanding each core customer relationship by cross-selling complementary products and services that enhance the functionality provided by our core information processing systems.\n•\nProviding non-core highly specialized core-agnostic complementary products and services to financial institutions, including institutions not utilizing a JKHY core operating system, and diverse corporate entities.\n•\nMaintaining a company-wide commitment to customer service that consistently exceeds our customers’ expectations and generates high levels of customer retention.\n•\nCapitalizing on our acquisition strategy.\nAcquisition Strategy\nWe have a disciplined approach to acquisitions and have been successful in supplementing our organic growth with 34 strategic acquisitions since the end of fiscal 1999. We continue to explore acquisitions that have the potential to:\n•\nExpand our suite of complementary products and services;\n•\nProvide products and services that can be sold to both existing core and non-core customers and outside our base to new customers; and/or\n•\nProvide selective opportunities to sell outside our traditional markets in the financial services industry.\n7\nAfter 46 years in business, we have very few gaps in our product line, so it is increasingly difficult to find proven products or services that would enable our clients and prospects to better optimize their business opportunities or solve specific operational issues. In addition, we see few acquisition opportunities that would expand our market or enable our entry into adjacent markets within the financial services industry that are fairly priced or that we could assimilate into our company without material distractions.\nWe have a solid track record of executing acquisitions from both a financial and operational standpoint, and we will continue to pursue acquisition opportunities that support our strategic direction, complement and accelerate our organic growth, and generate long-term profitable growth for our stockholders. While we seek to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities, we will continue to explore alternative ways to leverage our cash position and balance sheet to the benefit of our stockholders, such as continued investment in new products and services for our customers, repurchases of our stock, and continued payment of dividends.\nOur most recent acquisition was:\nSolutions\n•\nOur core banking solutions support commercial banks with information and transaction processing platforms that provide enterprise-wide automation. We have three functionally distinct core bank processing systems and more than 140 fully integrated complementary solutions, including business intelligence and bank management, retail and business banking, digital and mobile internet banking and electronic payment solutions, risk management and protection, and item and document imaging solutions. Our core banking solutions have state-of-the-art functional capabilities, and we can re-market the hardware required by on-premise use of each software system. Our banking solutions can be delivered on-premise or through our private cloud delivery model and are backed by a company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service. We are a recognized market leader, currently supporting over 950 banks with our technology platforms.\n•\nOur core credit union solutions support credit unions of all sizes with an information and transaction processing platform that provides enterprise-wide automation. Our solution includes one flagship core processing system and more than 100 fully integrated complementary solutions, including business intelligence and credit union management, member and member business services, digital and mobile internet banking and electronic payment solutions, risk management and protection, and item and document imaging solutions. Our credit union solution also has state-of-the-art functional capabilities. We also re-market the hardware required by on-premise use of the software system. Our credit union solution can be delivered on-premise or through our private cloud delivery model, and is backed by our company-wide commitment to provide exceptional personal service. We currently support nearly 720 credit union customers.\n•\nOur non-core solutions for financial institutions are specialized products and services assembled primarily through our focused diversification acquisition strategy. These core-agnostic solutions are compatible with a wide variety of information technology platforms and operating environments and offer more than 100 complementary solutions, including proven solutions for generating additional revenue and growth, increasing security and mitigating operational risks, and/or controlling operating costs. Our non-core products and services enhance the performance of financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters, and diverse corporate entities. We have over\n7,800 customers, including over 6,150 unique non-core customers. These distinct products and services can be implemented individually or as solution suites to address specific business problems or needs and enable effective responses to dynamic industry trends.\nWe strive to develop and maintain functionally robust, integrated solutions that are supported with high service levels, regularly updating and improving those solutions using an interactive customer enhancement process; ensuring compliance with relevant regulations; updated with proven advances in technology; and consistent with JKHY’s reputation as a premium product and service provider.\nCore Software Systems\nCore software systems primarily consist of the integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and to maintain centralized customer/member information.\nOur core banking solutions consist of three software systems marketed to banks and our core credit union solution consists of one software system marketed to credit unions. These core systems are available for on-premise\n8\ninstallation at customer sites, or financial institutions can choose to leverage our private cloud environment for ongoing information processing.\nCore banking platforms are:\n•\nSilverLake System®,\na robust system primarily designed for commercial-focused banks with assets ranging from $1 billion to $50 billion. Some progressive smaller banks and de novo (start-up) banks also select SilverLake. This system is in use by nearly 450 banks, and now automates over 9% of the domestic banks with assets less than $50 billion.\n•\nCIF 20/20®,\na parameter-driven, easy-to-use system that now supports approximately 332 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $4 billion.\n•\nCore Director®,\na cost-efficient system with point-and-click operation that now supports nearly 200 banks ranging from de novo institutions to those with assets of $2 billion.\nCore credit union platform is:\n•\nSymitar® (formerly known as Episys®),\na robust system designed specifically for credit unions. It has been implemented by nearly 720 credit unions with assets ranging from $3 million to $35 billion, and according to National Credit Union Administration (\"NCUA\") data, is the system implemented by more credit unions with assets exceeding $25 million than any other alternative core system.\nCustomers electing to install our solutions on-premise license the proprietary software systems. The majority of these customers pay ongoing annual software maintenance fees. We re-market the hardware, hardware maintenance, and peripheral equipment that is required by on-premise use of our software solutions; and we perform software implementation, data conversion, training, ongoing support, and other related services. On-premise customers generally license our core software systems under a standard license agreement that provides a fully paid, nonexclusive, nontransferable right to use the software on a single computer at a single location.\nCustomers can eliminate the significant up-front capital expenditures required by on-premise installations and the responsibility for operating information and transaction processing infrastructures by leveraging our private cloud environment for those functions. Our core private cloud services are provided through a highly resilient data center configuration across multiple physical locations. We also provide image item processing services from two host/archive sites and several key entry and balancing locations throughout the country. We print and mail customer statements for financial institutions from three regional printing and rendering centers. Customers electing to outsource their core processing typically sign contracts for seven or more years that include \"per account\" fees and minimum guaranteed payments during the contract period.\nWe support the dynamic business requirements of our core bank and credit union clients with ongoing enhancements to each core system, the regular introduction of new integrated complementary products, the ongoing integration of practical new technologies, and regulatory compliance initiatives. JKHY also serves each core customer as a single point of contact, support, and accountability.\nComplementary Products and Services\nWe have more than 140 complementary products and services that are targeted to our core banks and more than 100 targeted to credit union customers. Many of these are selectively sold to financial services organizations that use other core processing systems.\nThese complementary solutions enable core bank and credit union clients to respond to evolving customer/member demands, expedite speed-to-market with competitive offerings, increase operating efficiency, address specific operational issues, and generate new revenue streams. The highly specialized solutions enable diverse financial services organizations and corporate entities to generate additional revenue and growth opportunities, increase security and mitigate operational risks, and control operating costs.\nJKHY regularly introduces new products and services based on demand for integrated complementary solutions from our existing core clients, and based on the growing demand among financial services organizations and corporate entities for specialized solutions capable of increasing revenue and growth opportunities, mitigating and controlling operational risks, and/or containing costs. The Company’s Industry Research department solicits customer guidance on the business solutions they need, evaluates available solutions and competitive offerings, and manages the introduction of new product offerings. JKHY’s new complementary products and services are developed internally, acquired, or provided through strategic alliances.\n9\nImplementation and Training\nMost of our core bank and credit union customers contract with us for implementation and training services in connection with their systems and additional complementary products.\nA complete core system implementation typically includes detailed planning, project management, data conversion, and testing. Our experienced implementation teams travel to customer facilities or work remotely with clients to help manage the implementation process and ensure that all data is transferred from the legacy system to the JKHY system. Our implementation fees are fixed or hourly based on the core system being installed.\nWe also provide extensive initial and ongoing education to our customers. We have a comprehensive training program that supports new customers with basic training and longtime customers with continuing education. The curricula provide the ongoing training financial institutions need to maximize the use of JKHY’s core and complementary products, to optimize ongoing system enhancements, and to fully understand dynamic year-end legislative and regulatory requirements. Each basic, intermediate, and advanced course is delivered by system experts, supported by professional materials and training tools, and incorporates different educational media in a blended learning approach. The program supports distinct learning preferences with a variety of delivery channels, including classroom-based courses offered in JKHY’s regional training centers, Internet-based live instruction, eLearning courses, on-site training, and train-the-trainer programs.\nSupport and Services\nWe serve our customers as a single point of contact and support for the complex solutions we provide. Our comprehensive support infrastructure incorporates:\n•\nExacting service standards;\n•\nTrained support staff available up to 24 hours a day, 365 days a year;\n•\nAssigned account managers;\n•\nSophisticated support tools, resources, and technology;\n•\nBroad experience converting diverse banks and credit unions to our core platforms from competitive platforms;\n•\nHighly effective change management and control processes; and\n•\nA best practices methodology developed and refined through the company-wide, day-to-day experience supporting over 7,800 diverse clients.\nMost on-premise customers contract for annual software support services, and this represents a significant source of recurring revenue for JKHY. These support services are typically priced at approximately 20% of the respective product’s software license fee. The subsequent years' service fees generally increase as customer assets increase and as additional complementary products are purchased. Annual software support fees are typically billed during June and are paid in advance for the entire fiscal year, with proration for new product implementations that occur during the fiscal year. Hardware support fees also are usually paid in advance for entire contract periods which typically range from one to five years. Most support contracts automatically renew unless the customer or JKHY gives notice of termination at least 30 days prior to contract expiration.\nHigh levels of support are provided to our private cloud customers by the same support infrastructure utilized for on-premise customers. However, these support fees are included as part of monthly private cloud fees.\nJKHY regularly measures customer satisfaction using annual surveys and more frequent online surveys initiated randomly by routine support requests. We believe the results of the surveys confirm that we consistently exceed our customers’ service-related expectations.\nHardware Systems\nOur software systems operate on a variety of hardware platforms. We have established remarketing agreements with IBM Corporation, and many other hardware providers that allow JKHY to purchase hardware and related maintenance services at a discount and resell them directly to our customers. We currently sell IBM Power Systems™; Lenovo, Dell, Hewlett Packard, and Cisco servers and workstations; Canon, Digital Check, Epson, and Panini check scanners; and other devices that complement our software solutions.\nDigital Products and Services\nJack Henry Digital represents a category of digital products and services that are being built and integrated together into one unified platform. Our main offering is the Banno Digital Platform. It is an online and mobile banking platform that helps community and regional financial institutions strategically differentiate their digital offerings from those of megabanks and other financial technology companies. It is a complete, open digital banking platform that gives\n10\ncommunity financial institutions attractive, fast, native applications for their customers and members and cloud-based, core-connected back office tools for their employees.\nPayment Solutions\nElectronic payment solutions provide our customers with the tools necessary to be at the forefront of payment innovation with secure payment processing designed to simplify complex payment processing, attract profitable retail and commercial accounts, increase operating efficiencies, comply with regulatory mandates, and proactively mitigate and manage payment-related risk.\n•\nJHA Card Processing Solutions (\"CPS\")\nsupports full-service and in-house debit and credit card programs backed by a comprehensive suite of tools for fraud mitigation, digital payments, dispute management, plastics manufacturing and personalization, loyalty programs, data analytics, and terminal driving. In addition, advisory services are offered to support a variety of needs including card portfolio growth, start-up program consultation, as well as customized fraud management; all tailored to individual financial institution goals and concerns.\n•\nEnterprise Payment Solutions (\"EPS\")\nis a comprehensive payments engine. It offers an integrated suite of remote deposit capture, Automated Clearing House (\"ACH\"), and card transaction processing solutions, risk management tools, reporting capabilities, and more for financial institutions, businesses and FinTechs of all sizes. EPS helps its clients succeed in today’s competitive market to increase revenue, improve efficiencies, better manage compliance, and enhance customer relationships.\n•\niPay Solutions\nTM\nprovides consumers and businesses with money movement options through their financial institutions’ digital platforms including paying bills, sending money to anyone and transferring funds between their own accounts. iPay’s extensive application programming interface (\"API\") and hosted interfaces allow for multiple levels of integration by digital platforms and financial institutions. iPay provides financial institutions with services and tools to increase adoption, support end-users and monitor fraud. The money movement options keep the consumers and businesses engaged with the financial institution.\n•\nJHA PayCenter\nTM\n, provides our customer financial institutions with a single entry point to both Zelle and Real Time Payments (\"RTP\") real-time networks with plans to accommodate the Federal Reserve's FedNow in 2024, with testing to begin in 2023. PayCenter manages the certification process and mandatory updates from the networks, simplifies integration with toolkits and provides fraud monitoring. Financial institutions are able to send and receive transactions instantly 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, through our core and complementary solutions.\n•\nPayments as a Service (PaaS)\nties together and further enhances the complete array of electronic payments functionality with a front end Payments Developers Experience Portal and back end data analytics.\nResearch and Development\nWe invest significant resources in ongoing research and development to develop new software solutions and services and enhance existing solutions with additional functionality and features required to ensure regulatory compliance. Our core and complementary systems are enhanced a minimum of once each year. Product-specific enhancements are largely customer-driven with recommended enhancements formally gathered through focus groups, change control boards, strategic initiatives meetings, annual user group meetings, and ongoing customer contact. We also continually evaluate and implement process improvements that expedite the delivery of new products and enhancements to our customers and reduce related costs.\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $121.4 million, $109.0 million, and $110.0 million, respectively. We recorded capitalized software in fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020 of $148.2 million, $128.3 million, and $117.3 million, respectively.\nSales and Marketing\nJKHY serves established, well-defined markets that provide ongoing sales and cross-sales opportunities.\nThe marketing and sales initiatives within the core business lines are primarily focused on identifying banks and credit unions evaluating alternative core information and transaction processing solutions. Our non-core specialized core-agnostic niche solutions are sold to complement existing technology platforms to domestic financial services organizations of all asset sizes and charters.\nSales executives are responsible for the activities required to earn new customers in assigned territories, and regional account executives are responsible for nurturing customer relationships and cross selling additional products and services. Our sales professionals receive base salaries and performance-based commission compensation. Sales support staff provide a variety of services, including product and service demonstrations, responses to prospect-issued requests-for-proposals, and proposal and contract generation. Our marketing\n11\ndepartment supports sales with lead generation and brand-building activities, including participation in state-specific, regional, and national trade shows; print and online advertising; telemarketing; customer/client newsletters; ongoing promotional campaigns; and media relations. JKHY also hosts annual national education conferences which provide opportunities to network with existing clients and demonstrate new products and services.\nJKHY has sold select products and services outside the United States, primarily in Latin America and the Caribbean and Canada. International sales accounted for less than 1% of JKHY’s total revenue in each of fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nCompetition\nThe market for companies providing technology solutions to financial services organizations is competitive, and we expect that competition from both existing competitors and companies entering our existing or future markets will remain strong. Some of JKHY’s current competitors have longer operating histories, larger customer bases, and greater financial resources. The principal competitive factors affecting the market for technology solutions include product/service functionality, price, operating flexibility and ease-of-use, customer support, and existing customer references. For more than a decade there has been significant consolidation among providers of products and services designed for financial institutions, and this consolidation is expected to continue in the future.\nOur core solutions compete with large vendors that provide information and transaction processing solutions to banks and credit unions, including Fidelity National Information Services, Inc.; Fiserv, Inc.; and Finastra. Our non-core specialized solutions compete with an array of disparate vendors that provide niche solutions to financial services organizations and corporate entities.\nIntellectual Property, Patents, and Trademarks\nAlthough we believe our success depends upon our technical expertise more than our proprietary rights, our future success and ability to compete depend in part upon our proprietary technology. We have registered or filed applications for our primary trademarks. Most of our technology is not patented. Instead, we rely on a combination of contractual rights, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets to establish and protect our proprietary technology. We generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees, consultants, resellers, customers, and potential customers. Access to and distribution of our Company’s source code is restricted, and the disclosure and use of other proprietary information is further limited. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, unauthorized parties can attempt to copy or otherwise obtain, or use our products or technology. We cannot be certain that the steps taken in this regard will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology or that our competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to our technology.\nRegulatory Compliance\nJKHY maintains a corporate commitment to address compliance issues and implement requirements imposed by federal regulators prior to the effective date of such requirements when adequate prior notice is given. JKHY’s compliance program is coordinated by a team of compliance analysts and auditors that possess extensive regulatory agency and financial institution experience, and a thorough working knowledge of JKHY and our solutions. These compliance professionals leverage multiple channels to remain informed about potential and recently enacted regulatory requirements, including regular discussions on emerging topics with the Federal Banking Agencies (“FBA”) examination team and training sessions sponsored by various professional associations.\nJKHY has a process to inform internal stakeholders of new and revised regulatory requirements. Upcoming regulatory changes also are presented to the Company’s development teams through monthly regulatory compliance meetings and the necessary product changes are included in the ongoing product development cycle. JKHY publishes newsletters to keep our customers informed of regulatory changes that could impact their operations. Periodically, customer advisory groups are assembled to discuss significant regulatory changes.\nInternal audits of our systems, networks, operations, business recovery plans, and applications are conducted and specialized outside firms are periodically engaged to perform testing and validation of our systems, processes, plans and security. The FBA conducts annual reviews throughout the Company and issues a Report of Examination. The Board of Directors provides oversight of these activities through the Risk and Compliance Committee and the Audit Committee.\nGovernment Regulation\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. All financial institutions are subject to substantial regulatory oversight and supervision. Our products and services must comply with the extensive and evolving regulatory requirements applicable to our customers, including but not limited to those mandated by federal truth-in-lending and truth-in-savings rules, the Privacy of Consumer Financial\n12\nInformation regulations, usury laws, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, the Fair Housing Act, the Electronic Funds Transfer Act, the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the Bank Secrecy Act, the USA Patriot Act, the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, the Community Reinvestment Act and the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. The compliance of JKHY’s products and services with these requirements depends on a variety of factors, including the parameters set through the interactive design, the classification of customers, and the manner in which the customer utilizes the products and services. Our customers are contractually responsible for assessing and determining what is required of them under these regulations and then we provide solutions that assist them in meeting their regulatory needs through our products and services. We cannot predict the impact these regulations, any future amendments to these regulations or any newly implemented regulations will have on our business in the future.\nJKHY is not chartered by the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (\"OCC\"), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the FDIC, the NCUA or other federal or state agencies that regulate or supervise depository institutions. However, operating as a service provider to financial institutions, JKHY’s operations are governed by the same regulatory requirements as those imposed on financial institutions, and subject to periodic reviews by FBA regulators who have broad supervisory authority to remedy any shortcomings identified in such reviews.\nJKHY provides private cloud services through JHA OutLink Processing Services™ for banks and EASE Processing Services™ for credit unions. JKHY provides data centers and electronic transaction processing through JHA Card Processing Solutions™, internet banking through NetTeller® and Banno\nTM\nonline solutions, bill payment through iPay, network security monitoring and Hosted Network Solutions (\"HNS\") through our Gladiator® unit, cloud services through Hosted Partner Services and Enterprise Integration Services, and business recovery services through Centurion Disaster Recovery\n®\n.\nThe private cloud services provided by JKHY are subject to examination by FBA regulators under the Bank Service Company Act. These examinations cover a wide variety of subjects, including system development, functionality, reliability, and security, as well as disaster preparedness and business recovery planning. Our private cloud services are also subject to examination by state banking authorities on occasion.\nInformation and Cybersecurity\nIn our increasingly interconnected environment, information is inherently exposed to a growing number of risks, threats, and vulnerabilities. As a provider of products and services to financial institutions, we take extreme caution and due care in processing and storing sensitive, personally identifiable information securely. We prioritize protecting our associates, clients, and their private data from the ever-evolving cyber threat environment and ensuring the resiliency of such information.\nWe have an established information and cybersecurity program maintained by a team of diverse, highly skilled cybersecurity professionals, as well as a portfolio of investments in modern technology including artificial intelligence and machine learning. The program incorporates industry-standard frameworks, policies, and practices designed to protect the confidentiality and privacy of JKHY’s and our clients’ information. Additionally, we maintain insurance that includes cybersecurity coverage.\nIn support of the program, our systems and services undergo regular reviews performed by the same regulatory agencies that review financial institutions: Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (\"CFPB\"), Federal Reserve Board (\"FRB\"), FDIC, NCUA, and the OCC, among others. Reviews such as those by the Federal Banking agencies (a regulatory group comprised of the FDIC, FRB, and the OCC) assess and identify security gaps or flaws in controls and monitor the effectiveness of our security program. Critical services provided to our clients are subject to annual System and Organization Controls (\"SOC\") reviews by independent auditors. SOC reports are made available to clients via the client communications portal. Information and cybersecurity leadership reports to the Risk and Compliance Board committee and the full Board of Directors quarterly, on information security and cybersecurity matters.\nHuman Capital\nOur Employees\nAs of June 30, 2022, we had 6,847 full-time employees. Our employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement and there have been no labor-related work stoppages.\nTalent Attraction and Engagement\nOur people and culture strategy focuses on attracting, engaging, and retaining qualified, diverse, and innovative talent at all levels of the Company. We are a committed equal opportunity employer and all qualified candidates receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, age, disability, sex,\n13\nsexual orientation, gender, gender identity, pregnancy, genetic information, or other characteristics protected by applicable law.\nBeyond nondiscrimination compliance, we are committed to fostering a respectful, diverse, and inclusive workplace in which all individuals are treated with respect and dignity. We continue to concentrate efforts on diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging and have hired employees in the human resources function to focus on this important area. We seek nontraditional talent streams to help identify candidates from underrepresented groups, including through our internship program and our newly launched apprenticeship program. Our internship program focuses on attracting college and university students to paid work in JKHY departments related to their studies, while our apprenticeship program offers paid training and work for candidates (either students or non-students) with little to no traditional experience in the field, such as learning computer coding. Both our internship program and our apprenticeship program can lead to full-time employment. We have sought to expand our sources for candidates for these programs, including by increasing our recruiting efforts at historically black colleges and universities and through relationships with non-profits that promote employment opportunities for veterans.\nWe continue to engage our Business Innovation Groups (“BIGs”) to develop attraction and retention suggestions and practices that advance a diverse, equitable, and inclusive culture. Our BIGs are company-sponsored groups open to all employees. As of June 30, 2022, we had approximately 1,700 unique associates participating in six active BIGs, with five focused on inclusion for specific communities\n—\nwomen, people of color, remote associates, LGBTQ+, and veterans\n—\nand one focused on environmental and sustainability topics. While BIGs allow associates to connect and support each other, they also function to assist us in addressing bona fide business problems through input and suggestions. For example, these groups work with executive leadership to actively improve our talent attraction processes for prospective employees. They also provide education, training, and conversation opportunities to all employees to advance diversity, inclusion, understanding, and innovation throughout the Company.\nWe seek to actively listen to our employees throughout the year using a defined and continual listening strategy designed to gather regular feedback on well-being, engagement, leadership, ethics, culture and values, and other top of mind topics. These surveys allow us to respond to employee concerns, benefit from employee perspectives, and better design and develop processes to support our Company culture. Employees can learn about changes through our quarterly employee update videos or all-employee town hall meetings delivered by senior management.\nTraining and Development\nOur success depends not only on attracting and retaining talented employees, but also in developing our current employees and providing new opportunities for their growth. We offer our employees numerous live and on-demand training programs and resources to help them build knowledge and improve skills. These trainings include mandatory programs, such as security awareness, as well as recommended but optional programs in areas including leadership development; technical skills; and diversity, equity, and inclusion. Jack Tracks, a three-week virtual development event, offers employees a large selection of curated topics such as future readiness, technology trends, and education on Company solutions.\nRecognizing the importance of mentoring in career development, we host an internal mentorship marketplace, which allows prospective mentors and mentees to connect and self-initiate a mentoring relationship. We also make career mobility and personal development plan resources available to all employees. In fiscal 2022, we strengthened our leadership capacity by providing training on effective coaching practices to all leaders and offered a virtual summit for the Company’s most senior leaders focused on alignment to top priority business initiatives.\nWe recognize and value the contribution of our employees who develop, improve, and support our technology solutions and we provide additional development opportunities for them to advance their technical expertise. This includes access to on-demand technical training libraries, certification programs, and classes facilitated by external experts.\nWellness and Safety\nJKHY emphasizes the safety and well-being of our employees as a top priority. We define wellness comprehensively and include mental, physical, emotional, financial, psychological, and environmental considerations. JKHY offers a competitive compensation and benefits package and supports dedicated campaigns that communicate directly to employees about financial wellness, mental health, healthful nutrition and exercise, and other wellness topics. Employee well-being is further supported through policies such as remote work, paid parental leave, military service leave, educational assistance, and bereavement leave policies.\nFor more information on our COVID-19 response, see “COVID-19 Impact and Response” above.\n14\nAvailable Information\nJKHY’s Website is easily accessible to the public at\njackhenry.com\n. The “Investors\" portion of the Website provides key corporate governance documents, the code of conduct, an archive of press releases, and other relevant Company information. Our annual report on Form 10-K, quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, current reports on Form 8-K, and other filings and amendments thereto that are made with the SEC also are available free of charge on our website as soon as reasonably practical after these reports have been filed with or furnished to the SEC.  The SEC also maintains a website that contains reports, proxy and information statements, and other information regarding issuers that file electronically with the SEC at\nhttps://www.sec.gov\n."

    "text": "The Company's business and the results of its operations are affected by numerous factors and uncertainties, some of which are beyond our control. The following is a description of some of the important risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results of operations in future periods to differ materially from those expected or desired.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nData security breaches, failures or other incidents could damage our reputation and business.\nOur business relies upon receiving, processing, storing and transmitting sensitive information relating to our operations, employees, and customers. If we fail to maintain a sufficient digital security infrastructure, address security vulnerabilities and new threats, or deploy adequate technologies to secure our systems against attack, we may be subject to security breaches that compromise confidential information, adversely affect our ability to operate our business, damage our reputation and business, adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition, and expose us to liability. We rely on industry-standard encryption, network, and Internet security systems, most of which we license from third parties, to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure transmission of data and to prevent unauthorized access to our computer networks, systems, and data. A security failure by one of these third parties could expose our information systems to interruption of operations and security vulnerabilities. We also use third-party vendors to store and process data for us and they face similar risks. Our services and infrastructure are increasingly reliant on the Internet. Computer networks and the Internet are vulnerable to unauthorized access, computer viruses and other disruptive problems such as denial of service attacks or other cyber-attacks carried out by cyber criminals or state-sponsored actors. Other potential attacks include attempts to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information or destroy data, often through the introduction of computer viruses, ransomware or malware, cyber-attacks, and other means, which are constantly evolving and difficult to detect. Although none of these types of attacks have had a material effect on our business or operations to date, we anticipate that attempts to attack our systems, services, and infrastructure, and those of our customers and vendors, may grow in frequency and sophistication. Those same parties may also attempt to fraudulently induce employees, customers, vendors, or other users of our systems through phishing schemes or other methods to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our customers or clients.\nWe are also subject to the risk that our employees may intercept and transmit unauthorized confidential or proprietary information or that employee corporate-owned computers are stolen or customer data media is lost in shipment. An interception, misuse or mishandling of personal, confidential, or proprietary information being sent to or received from a customer or third party could result in legal liability, remediation costs, regulatory action, and reputational harm, any of which could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Under state, federal, and foreign laws requiring consumer notification of security breaches, the costs to remediate security breaches can be substantial. Although we believe our security controls and infrastructure are adequate to protect our systems and data, we cannot be certain that these efforts will be sufficient to combat all current and future technological risks and threats. Advances in computer capabilities, new discoveries in the field of cryptography, or other events or developments may render our security measures inadequate. Security risks may result in liability to our customers or other third parties, damage to our reputation, and may deter financial institutions from purchasing our products. The significant amount of capital and other resources we currently expend to protect against the threat of security breaches may prove insufficient to prevent a breach. We cannot ensure that any limitation-of-liability provisions in our customer and user agreements, contracts with third-party vendors, or other contracts are sufficient to protect us from liabilities or damages with respect to claims relating to a security breach or similar matters. The insurance coverage we maintain to address data security risks may be insufficient to cover all types of claims or losses that may arise, and there is no assurance that such insurance coverage will continue to be available to us on economically reasonable terms, or at all. In the event of a security breach, we may need to spend substantial additional capital and resources alleviating problems caused by such breach. Addressing security problems may result in interruptions, delays, or cessation of service to users, any of which could harm our business.\n15\nFailure to maintain sufficient technological infrastructure or an operational failure in our outsourcing facilities could expose us to damage claims, increase regulatory scrutiny and cause us to lose customers.\nOur products and services require substantial investments in technological infrastructure, and we have experienced significant growth in the number of users, transactions, and data that our technological infrastructure supports. If we fail to adequately invest in and support our technological infrastructure and processing capacity, we may not be able to support our customers’ processing needs and may be more susceptible to interruptions and delays in services. Damage or destruction that interrupts our outsourcing operations could cause delays and failures in customer processing which could hurt our relationship with customers, damage our reputation, expose us to damage claims, and cause us to incur substantial additional expense to relocate operations and repair or replace damaged equipment. Events that could cause operational failures include, but are not limited to, hardware and software defects, breakdowns or malfunctions, cybersecurity incidents, human error, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, computer viruses or other malware, or other events. Our facilities are also subject to physical risks related to natural disasters or severe weather events, such as tornados, flooding, hurricanes, and heat waves. Climate change may increase the likelihood and severity of such events. Our back-up systems and procedures may prove insufficient or otherwise fail to prevent disruption, such as a prolonged interruption of our transaction processing services. If an interruption extends for more than several hours, we may experience data loss or a reduction in revenues by reason of such interruption. Any significant interruption of service could reduce revenue, have a negative impact on our reputation, result in damage claims, lead our present and potential customers to choose other service providers, and lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of the critical services we provide to financial institutions, with resulting increases in compliance burdens and costs. Implementing modifications and upgrades to our technological infrastructure subject us to inherent costs and risks associated with changing systems, policies, procedures, and monitoring tools.\nFailures associated with payment transactions could result in financial loss.\nThe volume and dollar amount of payment transactions that we process is significant and continues to grow. We direct the settlement of funds on behalf of financial institutions, other businesses and consumers and receive funds from clients, card issuers, payment networks and consumers on a daily basis for a variety of transaction types. Transactions facilitated by us include debit card, credit card, electronic bill payment transactions, Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) payments, real-time payments through faster payment networks, and check clearing that support consumers, financial institutions, and other businesses. If the continuity of operations, integrity of processing, or ability to detect or prevent fraudulent payments were compromised in connection with payments transactions, we could suffer financial as well as reputational loss. In addition, we rely on various third parties to process transactions and provide services in support of the processing of transactions and funds settlement for certain of our products and services that we cannot provide ourselves. If we are unable to obtain such services in the future or if the price of such services becomes unsustainable, our business, financial position and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, we may issue short-term credit to consumers, financial institutions or other businesses as part of the funds settlement process. A default on this credit by a counterparty could result in a financial loss to us.\nFailures of third-party service providers we rely upon could lead to financial loss.\nWe rely on third party service providers to support key portions of our operations. We also rely on third party service providers to provide part or all of certain services we deliver to customers. As we continue to move more computing, storage, and processing services out of our data centers and facilities and into third-party hosting environments, our reliance on these providers and their systems will increase. While we have selected these third-party vendors carefully, we do not control their actions. A failure of these services by a third party could have a material impact upon our delivery of services to our customers. Such a failure could lead to damage claims, loss of customers, and reputational harm, depending on the duration and severity of the failure. Third parties perform significant operational services on our behalf. These third-party vendors are subject to similar risks as us including, but not limited to, compliance with applicable laws and regulations, hardware and software defects, breakdowns or malfunctions, cybersecurity incidents, human error, power losses, disruptions in telecommunications services, computer viruses or other malware, natural disasters or severe weather events, or other events. One or more of our vendors may experience a cybersecurity event or operational disruption and, if any such event does occur, it may not be adequately addressed, either operationally or financially, by the third-party vendor. Certain of our vendors may have limited indemnification obligations or may not have the financial capacity to satisfy their indemnification obligations. If a critical vendor is unable to meet our needs in a timely manner or if the services or products provided by such a vendor are terminated or otherwise delayed and if we are not able to develop alternative sources for these services and products quickly and cost-effectively, our customers could be negatively impacted, and it could have a material adverse effect on our business.\n16\nCompetition may result in decreased demand or require price reductions or other concessions to customers, which could result in lower margins and reduce income.\nWe vigorously compete with a variety of software vendors and service providers in all of our major product lines. We compete on the basis of product quality, reliability, performance, ease of use, quality of support and services, integration with other products, and pricing. Some of our competitors may have advantages over us due to their size, product lines, greater marketing resources, or exclusive intellectual property rights. New competitors regularly appear with new products, services, and technology for financial institutions. If competitors offer more favorable pricing, payment or other contractual terms, warranties, or functionality, or otherwise attract our customers or prevent us from capturing new customers we may need to lower prices or offer other terms that negatively impact our results of operations in order to successfully compete.\nFailure to achieve favorable renewals of service contracts could negatively affect our business.\nOur contracts with our customers for outsourced data processing and electronic payment transaction processing services generally run for a period of seven or more years. We will continue to experience a significant number of these contracts coming up for renewal each year. Renewal time presents our customers with the opportunity to consider other providers or to renegotiate their contracts with us, including reducing the services we provide or negotiating the prices paid for our services. If we are not successful in achieving high renewal rates upon favorable terms, revenues and profit margins will suffer. We may experience increased costs for services from our third-party vendors due to inflation or other cost expansion, but because our customer contracts typically have longer terms than our vendor contracts, our ability to pass on those higher costs to customers may be limited. If inflation or costs outpace our contractual ability to adjust pricing during the contractual terms of our customer contracts, our revenues and profit margins could be negatively impacted.\nIf we fail to adapt our products and services to changes in technology and the markets we serve, we could lose existing customers and be unable to attract new business.\nThe markets for our products and services are characterized by changing customer and regulatory requirements and rapid technological changes. These factors and new product introductions by our existing competitors or by new market entrants could reduce the demand for our existing products and services and we may be required to develop or acquire new products and services. Our future success is dependent on our ability to enhance our existing products and services in a timely manner and to develop or acquire new products and services. If we are unable to develop or acquire new products and services as planned, or if we fail to sell our new or enhanced products and services, we may incur unanticipated expenses or fail to achieve anticipated revenues, as well as lose prospective sales.\nSoftware defects or problems with installations may harm our business and reputation and expose us to potential liability.\nOur software products are complex and may contain undetected defects, especially in connection with newly released products and software updates. Software defects may cause interruptions or delays to our services as we attempt to correct the problem. We may also experience difficulties in installing or integrating our products on systems used by our customers. Defects in our software, installation problems or delays or other difficulties could result in negative publicity, loss of revenues, loss of competitive position or claims against us by customers. In addition, we rely on technologies and software supplied by third parties that may also contain undetected errors or defects that could have a negative effect on our business and results of operations.\nExpansion of services to non-traditional customers could expose us to new risks.\nWe have expanded our services to business lines that are marketed outside our traditional, regulated, and litigation-averse base of financial institution customers. These non-regulated customers may entail greater operational, credit, and litigation risks than we have faced before and could result in increases in bad debts and litigation costs.\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe software and services we provide to our customers are subject to government regulation that could hinder the development of our business, increase costs, or impose constraints on the way we conduct our operations.\nThe financial services industry is subject to extensive and complex federal and state regulation. As a supplier of software and services to financial institutions, portions of our operations are examined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and the National Credit Union Association, among other regulatory agencies. These agencies regulate services we provide and the way we operate, and we are required to comply with a broad range of applicable federal and state laws and regulations. If we, or third parties with whom we contract or partner, fail to comply with applicable regulations or guidelines, we could be subject to regulatory actions and suffer harm to our customer relationships and reputation. Such failures could require significant expenditures to correct and could negatively affect our ability to retain customers and obtain new customers.\nIn addition, existing laws, regulations, and policies could be amended or interpreted differently by regulators in a manner that imposes additional costs and has a negative impact on our existing operations or that limits our future\n17\ngrowth or expansion. New regulations could require additional programming or other costly changes in our processes or personnel. Our customers are also regulated entities, and actions by regulatory authorities could influence both the decisions they make concerning the purchase of data processing and other services and the timing and implementation of these decisions. We will be required to apply substantial research and development and other corporate resources to adapt our products to this evolving, complex, and often unpredictable regulatory environment. Our failure to provide compliant solutions could result in significant fines or consumer liability on our customers, for which we may bear ultimate liability.\nCompliance with new and existing privacy laws, regulations, and rules may adversely impact our expenses, development, and strategy.\nWe are subject to complex laws, rules, and regulations related to data privacy and cybersecurity. If we fail to comply with such requirements, we could be subject to reputational harm, regulatory enforcement, and litigation. The use, confidentiality, and security of private customer information is under increased scrutiny. Regulatory agencies, Congress, and state legislatures are considering numerous regulatory and statutory proposals to protect the interests of consumers and to require compliance with standards and policies that have not been defined. This includes rules enacted by the New York Department of Financial Services that require covered financial institutions to have a cybersecurity program along with other compliance requirements and the California Consumer Privacy Act. The unique data protection regulations issued by multiple agencies have created a fragmented series of requirements that makes it increasingly complex to comply with all the mandates in an efficient manner and may increase costs to deliver affected products and services as those requirements are established.\nFailure to comply or readily address compliance and regulatory rule changes made by payment card networks could adversely affect our business.\nWe are subject to card association and network compliance rules governing the payment networks we serve, including Visa, MasterCard, Zelle, and The Clearing House’s RTP network, and all rules governing the Payment Card Data Security Standards. If we fail to comply with these rules and standards, we could be fined or our certifications could be suspended or terminated, which could limit our ability to service our customers and result in reductions in revenues and increased costs of operations. Changes made by the networks, even when complied with, may result in reduction in revenues and increased costs of operations.\nEconomic Conditions Risks\nA widespread public health crisis could adversely affect our results of operations.\nThe widespread outbreak of a communicable illness or disease, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, or other public health crises, including government mandates in response to such events, can result in significant economic disruptions and uncertainties and could adversely affect our business, results of operation, and financial condition. The conditions caused by such events may affect the rate of spending by our customers and their ability to pay for our products and services, delay prospective customers’ purchasing decisions, interfere with our employees’ ability to support our business function, disrupt the ability of third-party providers we rely upon to deliver services, adversely impact our ability to provide on-site services or installations to our customers, or reduce the number of transactions we process, all of which could adversely affect our results of operation and financial position. We are unable to accurately predict the impact of such events on our business due to a number of uncertainties, including the duration, severity, geographic reach and governmental responses to such events, the impact on our customers’ and vendors' operations, and our ability to provide products and services, including the impact of our employees working remotely. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business will be harmed.\nOur business may be adversely impacted by general U.S. and global market and economic conditions or specific conditions in the financial services industry.\nWe derive most of our revenue from products and services we provide to the financial services industry. If the general economic environment worsens, or if conditions or regulatory requirements within the financial services industry change, such as if financial institutions are required to increase reserve amounts, customers may be less willing or able to pay the cost of our products and services, and we could face a reduction in demand from current and potential clients for our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations, and financial condition. In addition, a growing portion of our revenue is derived from transaction processing fees, which depend heavily on levels of consumer and business spending. Deterioration in general economic conditions could negatively impact consumer confidence and spending, resulting in reduced transaction volumes and our related revenues.\nConsolidation and failures of financial institutions will continue to reduce the number of our customers and potential customers.\nOur primary market consists of approximately 4,790 commercial and savings banks and more than 5,000 credit unions. The number of commercial banks and credit unions in the United States has experienced a steady decrease over recent decades due to mergers and acquisitions and financial failures and we expect this trend to continue as more consolidation occurs. Such events may reduce the number of our current and potential customers, which could negatively impact our results of operations.\n18\nAcquisition Risks\nOur growth may be affected if we are unable to find or complete suitable acquisitions.\nWe have augmented the growth of our business with a number of acquisitions and we plan to continue to acquire appropriate businesses, products, and services. This strategy depends on our ability to identify, negotiate and finance suitable acquisitions. Merger and acquisition activity in our industry has affected the availability and pricing of such acquisitions. If we are unable to acquire suitable acquisition candidates, we may experience slower growth.\nAcquisitions subject us to risks and may be costly and difficult to integrate.\nOn August 5, 2022, we entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger to acquire 100% of the equity interests of Payrailz, LLC, which offers digital payment capabilities, including real-time person-to-person (\"P2P\") payments. The acquisition is anticipated to close on August 31, 2022, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions. Acquisitions, including the Payrailz acquisition, are difficult to evaluate, and our due diligence may not identify all potential liabilities or valuation issues. We may also be subject to risks related to cybersecurity incidents or vulnerabilities of the acquired company and the acquired systems. We may not be able to successfully integrate Payrailz or any other acquired companies. We may encounter problems with the integration of new businesses, including: financial control and computer system compatibility; unanticipated costs and liabilities; unanticipated quality or customer problems with acquired products or services; differing regulatory and industry standards; diversion of management's attention; adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers; loss of key employees; and significant depreciation and amortization expenses related to acquired assets. To finance the Payrailz acquisition or other future acquisitions, we may have to increase our borrowing or sell equity or debt securities to the public. If we fail to integrate our acquisitions, our business, financial condition, and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Failed acquisitions could also produce material and unpredictable impairment charges as we review our acquired assets.\nIntellectual Property Risks\nIf others claim that we have infringed their intellectual property rights, we could be liable for significant damages or could be required to change our processes.\nWe have agreed to indemnify many of our customers against claims that our products and services infringe on the proprietary rights of others. We also use certain open source software in our products, which may subject us to suits by persons claiming ownership of what we believe to be open source software. Infringement claims have been and will in the future be asserted with regard to our software solutions and services. Such claims, whether with or without merit, are time-consuming, may result in costly litigation and may not be resolved on terms favorable to us. If our defense of such claims is not successful, we could be forced to pay damages or could be subject to injunctions that would cause us to cease making or selling certain applications or force us to redesign applications.\nOur failure to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights may adversely affect our competitive position.\nOur success and ability to compete depend in part upon protecting our proprietary systems and technology. Unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or access systems or technology that we consider proprietary. We actively take steps to protect our intellectual property and proprietary rights, including entering into agreements with users of our services for that purpose and maintaining security measures. However, these steps may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation. Policing unauthorized use of our proprietary rights is difficult and misappropriation or litigation relating to such matters could have a material negative effect on our results of operation.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nA material weakness in our internal controls could have a material adverse effect on us.\nEffective internal controls are necessary for us to provide reasonable assurance with respect to our financial reports and to mitigate risk of fraud. If material weaknesses in our internal controls are discovered or occur in the future, our consolidated financial statements may contain material misstatements and we could be required to restate our financial results, which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations or financial condition, restrict our ability to access the capital markets, require us to expend significant resources to correct the weaknesses or deficiencies, subject us to fines, penalties or judgments, harm our reputation or otherwise cause a decline in investor confidence.\n19\nThe loss of key employees and difficulties in hiring and retaining employees could adversely affect our business.\nWe depend on the contributions and abilities of our senior management and other key employees. Our Company has grown significantly in recent years and our management remains concentrated in a small number of highly qualified individuals. If we lose one or more of our key employees, we could suffer a loss of managerial experience, and management resources would have to be diverted from other activities to compensate for this loss. We do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers. Further, we are facing an increasingly competitive market for hiring and retaining skilled employees, which is exacerbated by the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and increased acceptance of hiring remote working employees by our competitors and other companies. Difficulties in hiring and retaining skilled employees may restrict our ability to adequately support our business needs and/or result in increased personnel costs. There is no assurance that we will be able to attract and retain the personnel necessary to maintain the Company’s strategic direction.\nThe impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill and intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations.\nOur balance sheet includes goodwill and intangible assets that represent a significant portion of our total assets at June 30, 2022. On an annual basis, and whenever circumstances require, we review our goodwill and intangible assets for impairment. If the carrying value of a material asset is determined to be impaired, it will be written down to fair value by a charge to operating earnings. An impairment of a significant portion of our goodwill or intangible assets could have a material negative effect on our operating results.\nAn increase in interest rates could increase our borrowing costs.\nAlthough our debt borrowing levels have historically been low, we may require additional or increased borrowings in the future under existing or new debt facilities to support operations, finance acquisitions, or fund stock repurchases. Our current revolving credit facility bears interest at a variable rate. Increases in interest rates on variable-rate debt would increase our interest expense, which could negatively impact our results of operations."

    "text": "The following section provides management's view of the Company's financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements, and related notes included elsewhere in this report. All dollar and share amounts, except per share amounts, are in thousands and discussions compare fiscal 2022 to fiscal 2021. Discussions of fiscal 2020 items and comparisons between fiscal 2020 and fiscal 2021 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Part II, Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021.\nOVERVIEW\nJack Henry & Associates, Inc. is a well-rounded financial technology company headquartered in Monett, Missouri, that employs approximately 6,900 full-time and part-time associates nationwide, and is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations. Its solutions serve over 7,800 customers and consist of integrated data processing systems solutions to U.S. banks ranging from de novo to multi-billion-dollar institutions with assets up to $50 billion, core data processing solutions for credit unions of all sizes, and non-core highly specialized core-agnostic products and services that enable financial institutions of every asset size and charter, and diverse corporate entities outside the financial services industry, to mitigate and control risks, optimize revenue and growth opportunities, and contain costs. JKHY's integrated solutions are available for on-premise installation and delivery in our private cloud.\nEach of our solutions shares the fundamental commitment to provide high-quality business systems, service levels that consistently exceed customer expectations, and integration of solutions and practical new technologies. The quality of our solutions, our high service standards, and the fundamental way we do business typically foster long-term customer relationships, attract prospective customers, and have enabled us to capture substantial market share.\nThrough internal product development, disciplined acquisitions, and alliances with companies offering niche solutions that complement our proprietary solutions, we regularly introduce new products and services and generate new cross-sales opportunities across our three primary marketed brands. We provide compatible computer hardware for our on-premise installations and secure processing environments for our outsourced solutions in our private cloud. We perform data conversions, software implementations, initial and ongoing customer training, and ongoing customer support services.\nWe believe our primary competitive advantage is customer service. Our support infrastructure and strict standards provide service levels we believe to be the highest in the markets we serve and generate high levels of customer satisfaction and retention. We consistently measure customer satisfaction using comprehensive annual surveys and randomly generated daily surveys we receive in our everyday business. Dedicated surveys are also used to grade specific aspects of our customer experience, including product implementation, education, and consulting services.\nOur two primary revenue streams are \"services and support\" and \"processing.\" Services and support includes: \"private and public cloud\" fees that predominantly have contract terms of seven years or longer at inception; \"product delivery and services\" revenue, which includes revenue from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversion fees, consulting, and hardware; and \"on-premise support\" revenue, composed of maintenance fees which primarily contain annual contract terms. Processing revenue includes: \"remittance\" revenue from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; \"card\" fees, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and \"transaction and digital\" revenue, which includes transaction and mobile\n23\nprocessing fees. We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.\nWe have four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The respective segments include all related revenues along with the related cost of sales.\nCOVID-19 Impact and Response\nSince its outbreak in early calendar 2020, COVID-19 has rapidly spread and continues to represent a public health concern. The health, safety, and well-being of our employees and customers is of paramount importance to us. In March 2020, we established an internal task force composed of executive officers and other members of management to frequently assess updates to the COVID-19 situation and recommend Company actions. We offered remote working as a recommended option to employees whose job duties allowed them to work off-site, and we suspended all non-essential business travel. As of August 15, 2022, the majority of our employees were continuing to work remotely either full time or in a hybrid capacity. We have announced that our official return-to-office date is September 6, 2022, though employees have been permitted to voluntarily return to the office since May 2, 2022. Individual decisions on returning to the office will be manager-coordinated and based on conversations with specific teams and departments. A large number of our employees have requested to remain fully remote or participate in a hybrid approach where they would split their time between remote and in-person working. While our business travel is normalizing, we do not expect it to return to pre-pandemic levels and continue to encourage a cautious approach to business travel activities.\nCustomers\nWe work closely with our customers who are scheduled for on-site visits to ensure their needs are met while taking necessary safety precautions when our employees are required to be at a customer site. Delays of customer system installations due to COVID-19 have been limited, and we have developed processes to handle remote installations when available. We expect these processes to provide flexibility and value both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Even though a substantial portion of our workforce has worked remotely during the outbreak and business travel has been limited, we have not yet experienced significant disruption to our operations. We believe our technological capabilities are well positioned to allow our employees to work remotely without materially impacting our business.\nFinancial Impact\nDespite the changes and restrictions caused by COVID-19, the overall financial and operational impact on our business has been limited and our liquidity, balance sheet, and business trends remain strong. We experienced positive operating cash flows during fiscal 2022, and we do not expect that to change in the near term. However, we are unable to accurately predict the future impact of COVID-19 due to a number of uncertainties, including further government actions; the duration, severity and recurrence of the outbreak, including the onset of variants of the virus; the effectiveness of vaccines against new variants; the development and effectiveness of treatments; the effect on the economy generally; the potential impact to our customers, vendors, and employees; and how the potential impact might affect future customer services, processing and installation-related revenue, and processes and efficiencies within the Company directly or indirectly impacting financial results. We will continue to monitor COVID-19 and its possible impact on the Company and to take steps necessary to protect the health and safety of our employees and customers. For a further discussion of the uncertainties and risks associated with COVID-19, see Part II, Item 1A “Risk Factors” in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nA detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations follows.\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nFISCAL 2022 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2021\nIn fiscal 2022, total revenue increased 11% or $184,659, compared to fiscal 2021. Reducing total revenue for the effects of deconversion fees of $53,279 for the current fiscal year and $20,635 for the prior fiscal year, and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2022 of $274 and in fiscal 2021 of $1,182, results in a 9% increase, or $152,923. This increase was primarily driven by growth in private and public cloud, card processing, remittance, implementation, and transaction and digital revenues, partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue compared to the prior fiscal year.\nOperating expenses increased 8% in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher costs related to our card payment processing platform associated with corresponding increases in revenue, higher personnel costs, increased operating licenses and fees, and higher travel expenses.\n24\nWe move into fiscal 2023 following strong performance in fiscal 2022. Significant portions of our business continue to provide recurring revenue and our sales pipeline is also encouraging. Our customers continue to face regulatory and operational challenges which our products and services address, and in these times, they have an even greater need for our solutions that directly address institutional profitability, efficiency, and security. We believe our strong balance sheet, access to extensive lines of credit, the strength of our existing product line and an unwavering commitment to superior customer service position us well to address current and future opportunities.\nA detailed discussion of the major components of the results of operations for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 compared to the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 follows.\nREVENUE\nServices and support includes: \"private and public cloud\" fees that predominantly have contract terms of seven years or greater at inception; \"product delivery and services\" revenue, which includes revenue from the sales of licenses, implementation services, deconversion fees, consulting, and hardware; and \"on-premise support\" revenue, which is composed primarily of maintenance fees with annual contract terms.\nIn the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022, services and support revenue increased compared to the prior fiscal year. Reducing total services and support revenue by the effects of deconversion fees for each year, which totaled $53,279 in fiscal 2022 and $20,635 in fiscal 2021, and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2021 of $1,181, revenue grew 7.5%. This increase was primarily driven by higher private and public cloud revenue resulting from organic growth in data processing and hosting fee revenue reflecting a continuing shift of customers to our term license model. Growth in implementation and software usage revenues also contributed to the increase, partially offset by a decrease in license fee revenue compared to the prior fiscal year.\nProcessing revenue includes: \"remittance\" revenue from payment processing, remote capture, and ACH transactions; \"card\" fees, including card transaction processing and monthly fees; and \"transaction and digital\" revenue, which includes transaction and mobile processing fees. We continually seek opportunities to increase revenue while at the same time containing costs to expand margins.\nProcessing revenue increased 11% for the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2022, compared to the fiscal year ended\nJune 30, 2021, with strong organic growth in the card processing, transaction and digital, and remittance revenue components primarily due to expanding volumes.\nOPERATING EXPENSES\nCost of revenue for fiscal 2022 increased 6% compared to fiscal 2021, driven by higher direct costs associated with our card processing platform in line with related revenue increases, higher personnel costs, and higher operating licenses and fees. Cost of revenue decreased 2% as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\n25\nWe devote significant effort and expense to develop new software, service products and continually upgrade and enhance our existing offerings. We believe our research and development efforts are highly efficient because of the extensive experience of our research and development staff and because our product development is highly customer driven.\nResearch and development expenses for fiscal 2022 increased 11% compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher personnel costs, net of capitalization. Research and development expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2022 and fiscal 2021. The consistency of this expense category for the fiscal years presented reflected our continuing commitment to the development of strategic products.\nSelling, general, and administrative costs included all expenses related to sales efforts, commissions, finance, legal, and human resources, plus all administrative costs.\nSelling, general, and administrative expenses for fiscal 2022 increased 17% compared to fiscal 2021. Reducing total selling, general, and administrative expense for the effects of deconversion fees from each year, which totaled $2,485 in fiscal 2022 and $489 in fiscal 2021, and removing the effects of acquisitions, divestitures, and gain/loss of $29 for the current fiscal year and of $(2,012) for the prior fiscal year, selling, general, and administrative expense increased 14% compared to fiscal 2021. This increase was primarily due to higher personnel costs, increased travel expenses, and a smaller gain on sale of assets in the current fiscal year. Selling, general, and administrative expense remained consistent as a percentage of total revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nInterest income fluctuated due to changes in invested balances and yields on invested balances. Interest expense increased in fiscal 2022 mainly due to the timing and amounts of borrowed balances.\nThe increase in the Company's effective tax rate in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 was primarily the result of an increase in the state tax rate applied to net deferred tax liabilities and less rate benefit received from research and development credits.\nNet income grew 17% to $362,916, or $4.94 per diluted share, in fiscal 2022 from $311,469, or $4.12 per diluted share, in fiscal 2021. The diluted earnings per share increase year over year was 20%. Growth in net income and\n26\nearnings per share was primarily due to the organic growth in our lines of revenue in fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, partially offset by the increase in provision for income taxes.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENT DISCUSSION\nThe Company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations.\nThe Company’s operations are classified into four reportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services; online and mobile bill pay solutions; ACH origination and remote deposit capture processing; and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software, hosted processing platforms, and services, including call center support, and network security management, consulting, and monitoring, that can be integrated with our core solutions and many can be used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributed to any of the other three segments, as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments.\nImmaterial adjustments were made in fiscal 2022 to reclassify cost of revenue in fiscal 2021 from the Core segment to the Corporate and Other segment to be consistent with the current fiscal year allocation of cost of revenue by segment. The amounts reclassified for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021 were $135.\nIn fiscal 2022, revenue in the Core segment increased 10% compared to fiscal 2021. Reducing total Core revenue by the effects of deconversion fees from both years, which totaled $23,048 in fiscal 2022 and $7,458 in fiscal 2021, and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures in fiscal 2021 of $1,180, Core segment revenue increased 8%. This increase was primarily driven by organic increases in our private and public cloud revenue. Cost of revenue in the Core segment increased 6% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with the organic growth in cloud revenue. Core segment cost of revenue decreased 2% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nIn fiscal 2022, revenue in the Payments segment increased 10% compared to fiscal 2021. Reducing total Payments revenue by the effects of deconversion fees from both years, which totaled $14,319 in fiscal 2022 and $6,285 in fiscal 2021, Payments segment revenue increased 9%. This increase was primarily driven by organic growth within card processing and remittance fee revenues. Cost of revenue in the Payments segment increased 8% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021 primarily due to increased costs associated with our card processing platform and other costs related to the organic growth in card processing and remittance fees. Payments segment cost of revenue decreased 1% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nRevenue in the Complementary segment increased 11% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. Reducing total Complementary revenue by the effects of deconversion fees from both years, which totaled $15,589 in fiscal 2022 and $6,778 in fiscal 2021, and for revenue from acquisitions and divestitures of $274 from fiscal 2022, Complementary segment revenue increased 9%. This increase was driven by organic increases in our transaction\n27\nand digital, private and public cloud, and on-premise support revenues. Cost of revenue in the Complementary segment increased 9% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021, primarily due to higher direct costs, increased personnel costs, amortization expense mainly related to capitalized software, and operating licenses and fees. Complementary segment cost of revenue decreased 1% as a percentage of revenue for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021.\nRevenue in the Corporate and Other segment increased 14% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increase was mainly due to increased on-premise support and implementation revenues.\nCost of revenue for the Corporate and Other segment includes operating costs not directly attributable to any of the other three segments and increased 2% for fiscal 2022 compared to fiscal 2021. The increased Corporate and Other segment cost of revenue was primarily related to increased operating licenses and fees.\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company's cash and cash equivalents decreased to $48,787 at June 30, 2022 from $50,992 at June 30, 2021. The following table summarizes net cash from operating activities in the statement of cash flows:\nCash provided by operating activities for fiscal 2022 increased 9% compared to fiscal 2021.  Cash from operations is primarily used to repay debt, pay dividends and repurchase stock, and for capital expenditures.\nCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2022 totaled $196,344 and included: $148,239 for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product and service offerings; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $34,659, mainly for the purchase of computer equipment; $8,491 for the purchase and development of internal use software; and $5,000 for purchase of investments. These expenditures were partially offset by $45 of proceeds from asset sales.\nCash used in investing activities for fiscal 2021 totaled $162,250 and included: $128,343 for the ongoing enhancements and development of existing and new product and service offerings; capital expenditures on facilities and equipment of $22,988, mainly for the purchase of computer equipment; $13,300 for the purchase of investments; $6,506 for the purchase and development of internal use software; and $2,300, net of cash acquired, for asset acquisitions last year; These expenditures were partially offset by $6,187 of proceeds from the sale of assets and $5,000 of proceeds from investments.\nFinancing activities used cash of $310,492 for fiscal 2022 and included $193,916 for the purchase of treasury shares and $139,070 for dividends paid to stockholders. These expenditures were partially offset by borrowings and repayments on our revolving credit facility and financing leases which netted to a borrowing of $14,873 and $7,621 of net cash inflow related to stock-based compensation.\nFinancing activities used cash in fiscal 2021 of $462,232 and included $431,529 for the purchase of treasury shares and $133,800 for dividends paid to stockholders. These expenditures were partially offset by borrowings and repayments on our revolving credit facility and financing leases which netted to $99,886 at June 30, 2021 and $3,211 of net cash inflow related to stock-based compensation.\n28\nCapital Requirements and Resources\nThe Company generally uses existing resources and funds generated from operations to meet its capital requirements. Capital expenditures totaling $34,659 and $22,988 for fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and June 30, 2021, respectively, were made primarily for additional equipment and the improvement of existing facilities. These additions were funded from cash generated by operations. At June 30, 2022, the Company had no significant outstanding purchase commitments related to property and equipment. We assessed our liquidity needs throughout fiscal 2022, including in relation to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and determined we had adequate capital resources and sufficient access to external financing sources to satisfy our current and reasonably anticipated funding needs. We will continue to monitor and assess these needs going forward.\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had contractual obligations of $1,449,442, including operating lease obligations and $1,393,541 related to off-balance sheet purchase obligations. Included in off-balance sheet purchase obligations were open purchase orders of $167,692 and a strategic services agreement entered into by JKHY in fiscal 2017 with First Data® and PSCU® to provide full-service debit and credit card processing on a single platform to all existing core bank and credit union customers, as well as to expand our card processing platform to financial institutions outside our core customer base. This agreement and subsequent amendments include a total purchase commitment at June 30, 2022 of $980,348 over the remaining term of the contract, which currently extends until January 2036, subject to certain renewal terms. Contractual obligations also include an agreement entered into during fiscal 2022 with Google LLC to provide Google Cloud Platform to the Company, including a total purchase commitment at June 30, 2022 of $225,000. Contractual obligations also include an agreement entered into during fiscal 2022 with Feedzai Inc. to provide a software as a service offering that allows prevention, detection, and monitoring of financial crime, including a total purchase commitment at June 30, 2022 of $20,501. Contractual obligations exclude, however, $10,225 of liabilities for uncertain tax positions as we are unable to reasonably estimate the ultimate amount or timing of settlement.\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time. At June 30, 2022, there were 31,043 shares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to 3,948 additional shares. The total cost of treasury shares at June 30, 2022 was $1,807,118. During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased 1,250 treasury shares for $193,916. At June 30, 2021, there were 29,793 shares in treasury stock and the Company had authority to repurchase up to 5,198 additional shares.\nWe have entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Payrailz, LLC. We anticipate the transaction closing on August 31, 2022. In connection with the closing, we expect to amend the revolving credit facility to increase the borrowing limit to allow funding of the transaction.\nRevolving credit facility\nOn February 10, 2020, the Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $300,000, which may be increased by the Company at any time until maturity to $700,000. The credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on a eurocurrency rate or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) 0%, (ii) the U.S. Bank prime rate for such day, (iii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus 0.50% and (iv) the eurocurrency rate for a one-month interest period on such day for dollars plus 1.0%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the Company's leverage ratio. The credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and is subject to various financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility agreement. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The revolving credit facility terminates February 10, 2025. There was a $115,000 outstanding balance under the credit facility at June 30, 2022 and $100,000 outstanding balance under this credit facility at June 30, 2021.\nOther lines of credit\nThe Company has an unsecured bank credit line which provides for funding of up to $5,000 and bears interest at the prime rate less 1%. The credit line was renewed in May 2019 and modified in March 2021 to extend the expiration to April 30, 2023. There was no balance outstanding at June 30, 2022 or June 30, 2021.\n29\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions and simplifies other requirements of Topic 740 guidance. The ASU was effective for the Company on July 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective July 1, 2021 with no material impact on its condensed consolidated financial statements.\nNot Adopted at Fiscal Year End\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt the ASU effective July 1, 2023, and will apply it prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after that date.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES\nWe prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP. The significant accounting policies are discussed in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. The preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, as well as disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. We base our estimates and judgments upon historical experience and other factors believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Changes in estimates or assumptions could result in a material adjustment to the consolidated financial statements.\nWe have identified several critical accounting estimates. An accounting estimate is considered critical if both: (a) the nature of the estimates or assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment involved, and (b) the impact of changes in the estimates and assumptions would have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe generate revenue from data processing, transaction processing, software licensing and related services, professional services, and hardware sales.\nSignificant Judgments in Application of the Guidance\nIdentification of Performance Obligations\nWe enter into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services. At contract inception,  we assess the solutions and services promised in our contracts with customers and identify a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations. We recognize revenue when or as we satisfy each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer.\nDetermination of Transaction Price\nThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. Our contracts with our customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration. We estimate variable consideration in our contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, we may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are long-term and include uncertain transactional volumes.\nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with our applications or service offerings. Whether we recognize revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether we control the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. This assessment is made at the performance obligation level.\n30\nAllocation of Transaction Price\nThe transaction price, once determined, is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which we separately sell each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, we estimate the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available, including reference to historical pricing data.\nContract Costs\nWe incur incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and customer conversion or implementation-related costs.\nCapitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated.\nDepreciation and Amortization Expense\nThe calculation of depreciation and amortization expense is based on the estimated economic lives of the underlying property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, which have been examined for their useful life and determined that no impairment exists. We believe it is unlikely that any significant changes to the useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets will occur in the near term, but rapid changes in technology or changes in market conditions could result in revisions to such estimates that could materially affect the carrying value of these assets and our future consolidated operating results. For long-lived assets, we consider whether any impairment indicators are present. If impairment indicators are identified, we test the recoverability of the long-lived assets. If this recoverability test is failed, we determine the fair value of the long-lived assets and recognize an impairment loss if the fair value is less than its carrying value.\nCapitalization of software development costs\nWe capitalize certain costs incurred to develop commercial software products. For software that is to be sold, significant areas of judgment include: establishing when technological feasibility has been met and costs should be capitalized, determining the appropriate period over which to amortize the capitalized costs based on the estimated useful lives, estimating the marketability of the commercial software products and related future revenues, and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. Costs incurred prior to establishing technological feasibility are expensed as incurred. Amortization begins on the date of general release and the appropriate amortization period is based on estimates of future revenues from sales of the products. We consider various factors to project marketability and future revenues, including an assessment of alternative solutions or products, current and historical demand for the product, and anticipated changes in technology that may make the product obsolete.\nFor internal use software, capitalization begins at the beginning of application development. Costs incurred prior to this are expensed as incurred. Significant estimates and assumptions include determining the appropriate amortization period based on the estimated useful life and assessing the unamortized cost balances for impairment. Amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life.\nA significant change in an estimate related to one or more software products could result in a material change to our results of operations.\nEstimates used to determine current and deferred income taxes\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes. We also must determine the likelihood of recoverability of deferred tax assets and adjust any valuation allowances accordingly. Considerations include the period of expiration of the tax asset, planned use of the tax asset, and historical and projected taxable income as well as tax liabilities for the tax jurisdiction to which the tax asset relates. Valuation allowances are evaluated periodically and will be subject to change in each future reporting period as a result of changes in one or more of these factors. Also, liabilities for uncertain tax positions require significant judgment in determining what constitutes an individual tax position as well as assessing the outcome of each tax position. Changes in judgment as to recognition or measurement of tax positions can materially affect the estimate of the effective tax rate and consequently, affect our financial results.\n31\nAssumptions related to purchase accounting and goodwill\nWe account for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting. This method requires estimates to determine the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired, including judgments to determine any acquired intangible assets such as customer-related intangibles, as well as assessments of the fair value of existing assets such as property and equipment. Liabilities acquired can include balances for litigation and other contingency reserves established prior to or at the time of acquisition and require judgment in ascertaining a reasonable value. Third-party valuation firms may be used to assist in the appraisal of certain assets and liabilities, but even those determinations would be based on significant estimates provided by us, such as forecast revenues or profits on contract-related intangibles. Numerous factors are typically considered in the purchase accounting assessments, which are conducted by Company professionals from legal, finance, human resources, information systems, program management and other disciplines. Changes in assumptions and estimates of the acquired assets and liabilities would result in changes to the fair values, resulting in an offsetting change to the goodwill balance associated with the business acquired.\nAs goodwill is not amortized, goodwill balances are regularly assessed for potential impairment. Such assessments include a qualitative assessment of factors that may indicate a potential for impairment, such as: macroeconomic conditions, industry and market changes, our overall financial performance, changes in share price, and an assessment of other events or changes in circumstances that could negatively impact us. If that qualitative assessment indicates a potential for impairment, a quantitative assessment is then required, including an analysis of future cash flow projections as well as a determination of an appropriate discount rate to calculate present values. Cash flow projections are based on management-approved estimates, which involve the input of numerous Company professionals from finance, operations and program management. Key factors used in estimating future cash flows include assessments of labor and other direct costs on existing contracts, estimates of overhead costs and other indirect costs, and assessments of new business prospects and projected win rates. Our most recent assessment indicates that no reporting units are currently at risk of impairment as the fair value of each reporting unit is significantly in excess of the carrying value. However, significant changes in the estimates and assumptions used in purchase accounting and goodwill impairment testing could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements."

    "text": "Index to Financial Statements\nFinancial Statement Schedules\nThere are no schedules included because they are not applicable, or the required information is shown in the consolidated financial statements or notes thereto.\n33\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Board of Directors and Stockholders of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc.\nOpinions on the Financial Statements and Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Jack Henry & Associates and its subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the related consolidated statements of income, changes in stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022, including the related notes (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 2022 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n34\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - estimating variable consideration and identification of and accounting for performance obligations\nAs discussed in Notes 1 and 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company recorded revenue of $1.943 billion for the year ended June 30, 2022. The Company enters into contracts with its customers, which frequently contain multiple performance obligations and variable contract consideration. The amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The Company’s contracts with its customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration. Management estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high degree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. At contract inception, management assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. The Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer. Significant judgment in revenue recognition for these customer contracts include, where relevant, (i) the estimation of variable consideration, principally, the varying volume of transactional activity over long-term contracts, and (ii) the identification of and accounting for all performance obligations.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the estimation of variable consideration and the identification of and accounting for performance obligations is a critical audit matter are significant judgment by management to estimate the variable consideration, principally, the varying volume of transactional activity and the identification of and accounting for all performance obligations in a contract. This in turn resulted in significant audit effort, a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity in performing our audit procedures and in evaluating the audit evidence obtained.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including the estimation of variable consideration and identification of and accounting for each performance obligation. The procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for determining the variable consideration and testing the reasonableness of management’s estimation of variable consideration. Testing the estimation of variable consideration included evaluating the terms and conditions of the long-term contracts and the related significant assumptions used in the estimate of the variable consideration, principally, the use of historical transaction volumes to estimate the varying volume of transactional activity. The procedures for testing the performance obligations and variable consideration included evaluation of the terms and conditions for a sample of contracts.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nKansas City, Missouri\nAugust 25, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2015.\n35\nMANAGEMENT’S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING\nThe management of Jack Henry & Associates, Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Exchange Act Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(e). The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Company’s consolidated financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with U.S. GAAP.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting includes policies and procedures pertaining to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect transactions and dispositions of assets of the Company; provide reasonable assurance transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP, and receipts and expenditures of the Company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and the directors of the Company; and provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the Company’s assets that could have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial statements. All internal controls, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even where internal control over financial reporting is determined to be effective, it can provide only reasonable assurance. Projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nAs of June 30, 2022, management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (\"COSO\"). Based on this assessment, management has concluded the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, was effective.\nThe Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2022, has been audited by the Company’s independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report appearing in this Item 8.\n36\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n37\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n38\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements.\n39\nSee notes to consolidated financial statements\n40\nJACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n(In Thousands, Except Per Share Amounts)\nNOTE 1.\nNATURE OF OPERATIONS AND SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nDESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY\nJack Henry & Associates, Inc. and subsidiaries (\"Jack Henry,\" \"JKHY,\" or the \"Company\") is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for the financial services industry. The Company has developed and acquired a number of banking and credit union software systems. The Company's revenues are predominately earned by marketing those systems to financial institutions nationwide by providing the conversion and implementation services for financial institutions to utilize JKHY systems, and by providing payment processing other related services. JKHY also provides continuing support and services to customers using on-premise or JKHY cloud-based systems.\nCONSOLIDATION\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of JKHY and all of its subsidiaries, which are wholly owned, and all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nUSE OF ESTIMATES\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with U.S. GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRisks and Uncertainties\nThe novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") pandemic adversely impacted global economic activity and contributed to significant volatility in financial markets during calendar 2020 through calendar 2022 year to date. The Company has not, to this point in time, experienced material impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic, but did assess certain accounting matters that generally require consideration of forecasted financial information in context with the information reasonably available to the Company as of and for its fiscal year ended June 30, 2022 and through the date of this report. The accounting matters assessed included, but were not limited to, the Company’s allowance for credit losses, as well as the carrying value of goodwill and other long-lived assets. While there was not a material impact to the Company’s consolidated financial statements for fiscal 2022 and no material impacts expected for foreseeable future, the Company will continue to monitor assessments of COVID-19, as well as other factors that could result in material impacts to the Company’s consolidated financial statements in future reporting periods.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nThe Company generates \"Services and Support\" revenue through software licensing and related services, private cloud core and complementary software solutions, professional services, and hardware sales. The Company generates \"Processing\" revenue through processing of remittance transactions, card transactions and monthly fees, and digital transactions.\nSignificant Judgments in Application of the Guidance\nIdentification of Performance Obligations\nThe Company enters into contracts with customers that may include multiple types of goods and services. At contract inception, the Company assesses the solutions and services promised in its contracts with customers and identifies a performance obligation for each promise to transfer to the customer a solution or service (or bundle of solutions or services) that is distinct - that is, if the solution or service is separately identifiable from other items in the arrangement and if the customer can benefit from the solution or service on its own or together with other resources that are readily available. Significant judgment is used in the identification and accounting for all performance obligations.\nDetermination of Transaction Price\nThe amount of revenue recognized is based on the consideration the Company expects to receive in exchange for transferring goods and services to the customer. The Company’s contracts with its customers frequently contain some component of variable consideration. The Company estimates variable consideration in its contracts primarily using the expected value method, based on both historical and current information. Where appropriate, the Company may constrain the estimated variable consideration included in the transaction price in the event of a high\n41\ndegree of uncertainty as to the final consideration amount. Significant judgment is used in the estimate of variable consideration of customer contracts that are long-term and include uncertain transactional volumes.\nTechnology or service components from third parties are frequently included in or combined with the Company’s applications or service offerings. Whether the Company recognizes revenue based on the gross amount billed to the customer or the net amount retained involves judgment in determining whether the Company controls the good or service before it is transferred to the customer. This assessment is made at the performance obligation level.\nAllocation of Transaction Price\nThe transaction price, once determined, is allocated between the various performance obligations in the contract based upon their relative standalone selling prices. The standalone selling prices are determined based on the prices at which the Company separately sells each good or service. For items that are not sold separately, the Company estimates the standalone selling prices using all information that is reasonably available, including reference to historical pricing data.\nCOMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT\nThe Company capitalizes new product development costs incurred for software to be sold from the point at which technological feasibility has been established through the point at which the product is ready for general availability. Software development costs that are capitalized are evaluated on a product-by-product basis annually for impairment and are assigned an estimated economic life based on the type of product, market characteristics, and maturity of the market for that particular product. These costs are amortized based on current and estimated future revenue from the product or on a straight-line basis, whichever yields greater amortization expense. All of this amortization expense is included within components of operating income, primarily cost of revenue.\nThe Company capitalizes development costs for internal use software beginning at the start of application development. Amortization begins on the date the software is placed in service and the amortization period is based on estimated useful life.\nCASH EQUIVALENTS\nThe Company considers all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of acquisition to be cash equivalents.\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE\nReceivables are recorded at the time of billing. On July 1, 2020, the Company adopted FASB Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") Topic 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, (\"CECL\") (see \"Recent Accounting Pronouncements\" below). As a result, the Company changed its accounting policy for allowance for credit losses. The accounting policy pursuant to CECL is disclosed below. The adoption of CECL resulted in an immaterial cumulative effect adjustment recorded in retained earnings as of July 1, 2020.\nThe Company monitors trade and other receivable balances and contract assets and estimates the allowance for lifetime expected credit losses. Estimates of expected credit losses are based on historical collection experience and other factors, including those related to current market conditions and events.\nThe following table summarizes allowance for credit losses activity for the years ended June 30, 2022, and 2021:\nPROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nProperty and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets.\n42\nIntangible assets consist of goodwill, customer relationships, computer software, and trade names acquired in business acquisitions in addition to internally developed computer software. The amounts are amortized, with the exception of those with an indefinite life (goodwill), over an estimated economic benefit period, generally three to twenty years.\nThe Company reviews its long-lived assets and identifiable intangible assets with finite lives for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of its assets might not be recoverable. The Company evaluates goodwill for impairment of value on an annual basis as of January 1 and between annual tests if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the asset might be impaired.\nPURCHASE OF INVESTMENT\nAt June 30, 2022 and 2021, the Company had $\n18,250\nand $\n13,250\n, respectively, invested in the preferred stock of Automated Bookkeeping, Inc. (\"Autobooks\"), which represents a non-controlling share of the voting equity of Autobooks. This investment was recorded at cost and is included within other non-current assets on the Company's balance sheet. The fair value of this investment has not been estimated, as estimation is not practicable due to limited investors which reduces available comparative information. There have been no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate an impairment and no price changes resulting from observing a similar or identical investment. An impairment and/or an observable price change would be an adjustment to recorded cost. Fair value will not be estimated unless there are identified events or changes in circumstances that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment. Equity transactions are monitored quarterly to assess whether there are indicators of fair value.\nCOMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nComprehensive income for each of the fiscal years ending June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 equals the Company’s net income.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION\nI\nn accordance with U.S. GAAP, the Company's operations are classified as\nfour\nreportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other (see Note 14). Substantially all the Company’s revenues are derived from operations and assets located within the United States of America.\nCOMMON STOCK\nThe Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase shares of its common stock. Under this authorization, the Company may finance its share repurchases with available cash reserves or short-term borrowings on its existing credit facilities. The share repurchase program does not include specific price targets or timetables and may be suspended at any time.\nAt June 30, 2022, there were\n31,043\nshares in treasury stock and the Company had the remaining authority to repurchase up to\n3,948\nadditional shares of its common stock. The total cost of treasury shares at June 30, 2022 was $\n1,807,118\n.  During fiscal 2022, the Company repurchased\n1,250\nshares of its common stock for $\n193,916\nto be held in treasury. At June 30, 2021, there were\n29,793\nshares in treasury stock and the Company had authority to repurchase up to\n5,198\nadditional shares of its common stock.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nPer share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. Stock options and restricted stock have been included in the calculation of income per diluted share to the extent they are dilutive. The difference between basic and diluted weighted average shares outstanding is the dilutive effect of outstanding stock options and restricted stock (see Note 11).\nINCOME TAXES\nDeferred tax liabilities and assets are recognized for the tax effects of differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities. A valuation allowance would be established to reduce deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized.\nThe Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities, based upon the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the financial statements from such a position is measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement. Also, interest and penalties expense are recognized on the full amount of unrecognized benefits for uncertain tax positions. The Company's policy is to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense.\n43\nRECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nIn December of 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes, which removes certain exceptions and simplifies other requirements of Topic 740 guidance. The ASU was effective for the Company on July 1, 2021. The Company adopted ASU 2019-12 effective July 1, 2021 and the adoption did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nNot Adopted at Fiscal Year End\nIn October of 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers, which improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency related to recognition of an acquired contract liability and payment terms and their effect on subsequent revenue recognized by the acquirer. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, and interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company plans to adopt the ASU effective July 1, 2023, and will apply it prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after that date.\nNOTE 2.\nREVENUE AND DEFERRED COSTS\nRevenue Recognition\nThe Company generates revenue from data processing, transaction processing, software licensing and related services, professional services, and hardware sales.\nThe Company recognizes revenue when or as it satisfies each performance obligation by transferring control of a solution or service to the customer.\nThe following describes the nature of the Company’s primary types of revenue:\nProcessing\nProcessing revenue is generated from transaction-based fees for electronic deposit and payment services, electronic funds transfers and debit and credit card processing. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis by processing an unspecified number of transactions over the contractual term. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed.  Customers are typically billed monthly for transactions processed during the month. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price after estimation of breakage associated with the material right.\nPrivate and Public Cloud\nPrivate and public cloud revenue is generated from data and item processing services and hosting fees. The Company’s arrangements for these services typically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services), and pricing may include tiered pricing structures. Amounts of revenue allocated to these services are recognized as those services are performed. Data and item processing services are typically billed monthly. The Company evaluates tiered pricing to determine if a material right exists. If, after that evaluation, it determines a material right does exist, it assigns value to the material right based upon standalone selling price.\nProduct Delivery and Services\nProduct delivery and services revenue is generated primarily from software licensing and related professional services and hardware delivery. Software licenses, along with any professional services from which they are not considered distinct, are recognized as they are delivered to the customer. Hardware revenue is recognized upon delivery. Professional services that are distinct are recognized as the services are performed. Deconversion fees are also included within product delivery and services and are considered a contract modification. Therefore, the Company recognizes these fees over the remaining modified contract term.\nOn-Premise Support\nOn-premise support revenue is generated from software maintenance for ongoing client support and software usage, which includes a license and ongoing client support. The Company’s arrangements for these services\n44\ntypically require the Company to “stand-ready” to provide specific services on a when and if needed basis. The fees for these services may be fixed or variable (based upon performing an unspecified quantity of services). Software maintenance fees are typically billed to the customer annually in advance and recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Software usage is typically billed annually in advance, with the license delivered and recognized at the outset, and the maintenance fee recognized ratably over the maintenance term. Accordingly, the Company utilizes the practical expedient which allows entities to disregard the effects of a financing component when the contract period is one year or less.\nTaxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are not included in revenue. The Company includes reimbursements from customers for expenses incurred in providing services (such as for postage, travel and telecommunications costs) in revenue, while the related costs are included in cost of revenue.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nThe tables below present the Company's revenue disaggregated by type of revenue. Refer to Note 14 – Reportable Segment Information, for disaggregated revenue by type and reportable segment. The majority of the Company’s revenue is earned domestically, with revenue from customers outside the United States comprising less than 1% of total revenue.\nContract Balances\nThe following table provides information about contract assets and contract liabilities from contracts with customers.\nContract assets primarily result from revenue being recognized when or as control of a solution or service is transferred to the customer, but where invoicing is contingent upon the completion of other performance obligations or payment terms differ from the provisioning of services. The current portion of contract assets is reported within prepaid expenses and other in the consolidated balance sheet, and the non-current portion is included in other non-current assets. Contract liabilities (deferred revenue) primarily relate to consideration received from customers in advance of delivery of the related goods and services to the customer. Contract balances are reported in a net contract asset or liability position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period.\nThe Company analyzes contract language to identify if a significant financing component does exist and would adjust the transaction price for any material effects of the time value of money if the timing of payments provides either party to the contract with a significant benefit of financing the transaction.\nFor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, the Company recognized revenue of $\n270,972\n, $\n256,952\n, and $\n259,887\n, respectively, that was included in the corresponding deferred revenue balance at the beginning of the periods.\nAmounts recognized that relate to performance obligations satisfied (or partially satisfied) in prior periods were immaterial for each period presented. These adjustments are primarily the result of transaction price re-allocations due to changes in estimates of variable consideration.\n45\nTransaction Price Allocated to Remaining Performance Obligations\nAs of June 30, 2022, estimated revenue expected to be recognized in the future related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied (or partially unsatisfied) at the end of the reporting period totaled $\n5,659,080\n. The Company expects to recognize approximately\n26\n% over the next\n12\nmonths,\n20\n% in\n13\n- 24 months, and the balance thereafter.\nContract Costs\nThe Company incurs incremental costs to obtain a contract as well as costs to fulfill contracts with customers that are expected to be recovered. These costs consist primarily of sales commissions, which are incurred only if a contract is obtained, and customer conversion or implementation-related costs. Capitalized costs are amortized based on the transfer of goods or services to which the asset relates, in line with the percentage of revenue recognized for each performance obligation to which the costs are allocated.\nCapitalized costs totaled $\n380,095\nand $\n314,807\n, at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nDuring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, amortization of deferred contract costs totaled $\n133,174\n, $\n122,143\n, and $\n117,763\n, respectively. There were no impairment losses in relation to capitalized costs for the periods presented.\nNOTE 3.\nFAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nFor cash equivalents, certificates of deposit, amounts receivable or payable, and short-term borrowings, fair values approximate carrying value, based on the short-term nature of the assets and liabilities.\nThe Company's estimates of the fair value for financial assets and financial liabilities are based on the framework established in the fair value accounting guidance. The framework is based on the inputs used in valuation, gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets, and requires that observable inputs be used in the valuations when available. The three levels of the hierarchy are as follows:\nLevel 1: inputs to the valuation are quoted prices in an active market for identical assets.\nLevel 2: inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for similar assets in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly.\nLevel 3: valuation is based on significant inputs that are unobservable in the market and the Company's own estimates of assumptions that we believe market participants would use in pricing the asset.\nFair value of financial assets included in current assets is as follows:\nNOTE 4.\nLEASES\nThe Company adopted ASU 2016-02 and its related amendments (collectively known as “ASC 842”) on July 1, 2019 using the optional transition method in ASU 2018-11. Therefore, the reported results for fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 reflect the application of ASC 842.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at inception. The lease term begins on the commencement date, which is the date the Company takes possession of the property and may include options\n46\nto extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the option will be exercised. The lease term is used to determine lease classification as an operating or finance lease and is used to calculate straight-line expense for operating leases.\nRight-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. As a practical expedient, lease agreements with lease and non-lease components are accounted for as a single lease component for all asset classes, which are comprised of real estate leases and equipment leases. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets also include prepaid lease payments and exclude lease incentives received. The Company estimates contingent lease incentives when it is probable that the Company is entitled to the incentive at lease commencement. Since the Company’s leases do not typically provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate based upon the information available at commencement date for both real estate and equipment leases. The determination of the incremental borrowing rate requires judgment. The Company determines the incremental borrowing rate using the Company’s current unsecured borrowing rate, adjusted for various factors such as collateralization and term to align with the terms of the lease. The Company elected the short-term lease recognition exemption for all leases that qualify. Therefore, leases with an initial term of 12 months or less are not recorded on the balance sheet; instead, lease payments are recognized as lease expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nThe Company leases certain office space, data centers and equipment. The Company’s leases have remaining terms of\n1\nto\n11\nyears. Certain leases contain renewal options for varying periods, which are at the Company’s sole discretion. For leases where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise a renewal option, such option periods have been included in the determination of the Company’s ROU assets and lease liabilities. Certain leases require the Company to pay taxes, insurance, maintenance, and other operating expenses associated with the leased asset. Such amounts are not included in the measurement of the lease liability to the extent they are variable in nature. These variable lease costs are recognized as a variable lease expense when incurred. Certain leases include options to purchase the leased asset at the end of the lease term, which is assessed as a part of the Company’s lease classification determination. The depreciable life of the ROU asset and leasehold improvements are limited by the expected lease term unless the Company is reasonably certain of a transfer of title or purchase option.\nAt June 30, 2022, and 2021, the Company had operating lease assets of $\n46,869\nand $\n55,977\nand financing lease assets of $\n65\nand $\n188\n, respectively.

These amounts were excluded from capital expenditures on the statements of cash flows.\n48\nNo\nimpairments of property and equipment were recorded in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, or 2020.\nDuring the quarter ended March 31, 2022, the Company received an offer to purchase one of its facilities and management has committed to sell the facility. At June 30, 2022, this facility's assets were classified as assets held for sale by the Company in the amount of $\n20,201\n, and were not included in property and equipment, net. Total assets held for sale by the Company at June 30, 2021, were $\n0\n.\nNOTE 6.\nOTHER ASSETS\nGoodwill\nThe carrying amount of goodwill for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021, by reportable segments, is as follows:\n1\nRelated to the transfer of our Call Center line of business from Core to Complementary, $\n4,017\nof goodwill was transferred in fiscal 2021 between the two based upon the estimated fair value of that line of business.\nGoodwill acquired during fiscal 2022 and 2021 was $\n0\nand $\n1,485\n, respectively. Goodwill consists largely of the growth potential, synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of the Company with those of the entities or assets acquired, together with their assembled workforces. No goodwill has been assigned to the Company's Corporate and Other reportable segment.\n49\nOther Intangible Assets\nInformation regarding other identifiable intangible assets is as follows:\nCustomer relationships have useful lives ranging from\n5\nto\n20\nyears.\nComputer software includes cost of software to be sold, leased, or marketed of $\n173,402\nand costs of internal-use software of $\n237,555\nat June 30, 2022. At June 30, 2021, costs of software to be sold, leased, or marketed totaled $\n146,090\n, and costs of internal-use software totaled $\n222,004\n.\nComputer software includes the unamortized cost of commercial software products developed or acquired by the Company, which are capitalized and amortized over useful lives generally ranging from\n5\nto\n15\nyears. Amortization expense for computer software totaled $\n105,036\n, $\n99,305\n, and $\n92,460\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

There were\nno\nmaterial impairments in fiscal years ended June 30, 2022 and 2021.\nThe Company's other intangible assets have useful lives ranging from\n3\nto\n20\nyears.\nAmortization expense for all intangible assets was $\n126,835\n, $\n123,233\n, and $\n119,599\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe estimated aggregate future amortization expense for each of the next five years for all intangible assets remaining as of June 30, 2022, is as follows:\nNOTE 7.\nDEBT\nThe Company had $\n67\noutstanding short-term debt and $\n115,000\noutstanding long-term debt at June 30, 2022, related to financing leases and the revolving credit facility. The Company had $\n110\noutstanding short-term debt and $\n100,083\noutstanding long-term debt at June 30, 2021.\nRevolving credit facility\nOn February 10, 2020, the Company entered into a five-year senior, unsecured revolving credit facility. The credit facility allows for borrowings of up to $\n300,000\n, which may be increased by the Company at any time until maturity to $\n700,000\n. The credit facility bears interest at a variable rate equal to (a) a rate based on a eurocurrency rate or (b) an alternate base rate (the highest of (i) 0%, (ii) the U.S. Bank prime rate for such day, (iii) the sum of the Federal Funds Effective Rate for such day plus\n0.50\n% and (iv) the eurocurrency rate for a one-month interest period on such day for dollars plus\n1.0\n%), plus an applicable percentage in each case determined by the Company's\n50\nleverage ratio. The credit facility is guaranteed by certain subsidiaries of the Company and is subject to various financial covenants that require the Company to maintain certain financial ratios as defined in the credit facility agreement. As of June 30, 2022, the Company was in compliance with all such covenants. The revolving credit facility terminates\nFebruary 10, 2025\n. There was $\n115,000\noutstanding balance under this credit facility at June 30, 2022 and $\n100,000\noutstanding balance under this credit facility at June 30, 2021.\nOther lines of credit\nThe Company has an unsecured bank credit line which provides for funding of up to $\n5,000\nand bears interest at the prime rate less\n1\n%. The credit line was renewed in May 2019 and modified in March 2021 to extend the expiration to\nApril 30, 2023\n. There was\nno\nbalance outstanding at June 30, 2022 or 2021.\nInterest\nThe Company paid interest of $\n1,788\n, $\n852\n, and $\n475\nduring the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022\n,\n2021, and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 8.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes consists of the following:\nThe tax effects of temporary differences related to deferred taxes shown on the balance sheets were:\n51\nThe following analysis reconciles the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rates reflected above:\nAs of June 30, 2022, the Company has $\n918\nof gross federal net operating loss (“NOL”) pertaining to the acquisition of Goldleaf Financial Solutions, Inc. which is expected to be utilized after the application of IRC Section 382. Separately, as of June 30, 2022, the Company has state NOL and tax credit carryforwards with a tax-effected value of $\n215\nand $\n1,700\n, respectively. The federal and state loss and credit carryover have varying expiration dates, ranging from fiscal 2023 to 2042. Based on state tax rules which restrict utilization of these losses and tax credits, the Company believes it is more likely than not that $\n200\nof these losses and tax credits will expire unutilized. Accordingly, valuation allowances of $\n200\nand $\n270\nhave been recorded against the state net operating losses and tax credit carryforwards as of June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively.\nThe Company paid income taxes, net of refunds, of $\n60,553\n, $\n80,220\n, and $\n63,692\nin fiscal 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nAt June 30, 2022, the Company had $\n8,990\nof gross unrecognized tax benefits, $\n8,066\nof which, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate. At June 30, 2021, the Company had $\n8,762\nof unrecognized tax benefits, $\n8,119\nof which, if recognized, would affect its effective tax rate. The Company had accrued interest and penalties of $\n1,234\nand $\n1,180\nrelated to uncertain tax positions at June 30, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The income tax provision included interest expense and penalties (or benefits) on unrecognized tax benefits of $\n73\n, $(\n310\n), and $\n38\nin the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nA reconciliation of the unrecognized tax benefits for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 follows:\nThe U.S. federal income tax returns for fiscal 2019 and all subsequent years remain subject to examination as of June 30, 2022 under statute of limitations rules. The U.S. state income tax returns that remain subject to examination as of June 30,2022 under the statute of limitation rules varies by state jurisdiction from fiscal 2016 through 2019 and all subsequent years.\nThe Company anticipates that potential changes due to lapsing statutes of limitations and examination closures could reduce the unrecognized tax benefits balance by $\n1,500\n- $\n4,000\nwithin twelve months of June 30, 2022.\n52\nNOTE 9.\nINDUSTRY AND SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION\nThe Company sells its products to banks, credit unions, and financial institutions throughout the United States and generally does not require collateral. All billings to customers are due 30 days from date of billing. Reserves are maintained for potential credit losses. Customer-related risks are moderated through the inclusion of credit mitigation clauses in the Company's contracts and through the monitoring of timely payments.\nIn addition, some of the Company’s key solutions are dependent on technology manufactured by third parties. Termination of the Company’s relationship with one or more of these third parties could have a negative impact on the operations of the Company.\nNOTE 10.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company's pre-tax operating income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 includes $\n24,780\n,\n$\n20,746\n, and $\n16,883\n, respectively, of equity-based compensation costs, of which $\n22,703\n, $\n18,817\n, and $\n15,148\n, respectively, relates to the restricted stock plans. Costs are recorded net of estimated forfeitures. The total income tax benefits from equity-based compensation for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 were $\n4,252\n, $\n3,258\n, and $\n3,072\n, respectively. These income tax benefits included income tax net excess benefits from stock option exercises and restricted stock vestings of $\n652\n, $\n719\n, and $\n340\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nStock Option Awards\nOn November 10, 2015, the Company adopted the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan (\"2015 EIP\") for its employees and non-employee directors. The plan allows for grants of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock shares or units, and performance shares or units. The maximum number of shares authorized for issuance under the plan is\n3,000\n. For stock options, terms and vesting periods of the options were determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors when granted. The option period must expire not more than ten years from the options grant date. The options granted under this plan are exercisable beginning\nthree years\nafter grant at an exercise price equal to 100% of the fair market value of the stock at the grant date. The options terminate upon surrender of the option,\nninety days\nafter termination of employment, upon the expiration of\none year\nfollowing notification of a deceased optionee, or\n10 years\nafter grant.\nA summary of option plan activity under the plan is as follows:\nThere were\nno\noptions granted in the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020.\nThe Company utilized a Black-Scholes option pricing model to estimate fair value of the stock option grants at the grant date. All remaining options were granted on July 1, 2016. Assumptions such as expected life, volatility, risk-\n53\nfree interest rate, and dividend yield impact the fair value estimate. These assumptions are subjective and generally require significant analysis and judgment to develop. The risk-free interest rate used in the Company's estimate was determined from external data, while volatility, expected life, and dividend yield assumptions were derived from its historical experience with share-based payment arrangements. The appropriate weight to place on historical experience is a matter of judgment, based on relevant facts and circumstances.\nAt June 30, 2022, there was\nno\ncompensation cost yet to be recognized related to outstanding options.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised was $\n1,005\n, $\n0\n, and $\n809\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022,  2021, and 2020, respectively.  There were\n10\noptions exercised for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2022.\nRestricted Stock Awards\nThe Restricted Stock Plan was adopted by the Company on November 1, 2005, for its employees. The plan expired on November 1, 2015.  Up to\n3,000\nshares of common stock were available for issuance under the plan. The 2015 EIP was adopted by the Company on November 10, 2015, for its employees. Up to\n3,000\nshares of common stock are available for issuance under the 2015 EIP. Upon issuance, shares of restricted stock were subject to forfeiture and to restrictions which limited the sale or transfer of the shares during the restriction period. The restrictions were lifted over periods ranging from\n3\nyears to\n5\nyears from grant date.\nThe following table summarizes non-vested share awards activity:\nNo\nshares of restricted stock were granted during the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nThe non-vested share awards granted prior to July 1, 2016, did not participate in dividends during the restriction period. As a result, the weighted-average fair value of the non-vested share awards was based on the fair market value of the Company’s equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of the expected future dividends to be declared during the restriction period, consistent with the methodology for calculating compensation expense on such awards. The non-vested share awards granted after July 1, 2016, did participate in dividends during the restriction period and the weighted-average fair value of such participating awards was based on the fair market value on the grant date.\nRestricted Stock Unit Awards\nAn amendment to the Restricted Stock Plan was adopted by the Company on August 20, 2010, whereby restricted stock unit (\"unit/s\") awards were made to employee participants rather than restricted stock. The awarding of units continued with the 2015 Equity Incentive Plan. It is the intention of the Company to settle the unit awards in shares of the Company’s stock. Unit awards that have service requirements only and are not tied to performance measures generally vest over a period of\n1\nto\n3\nyears.\nThe following table summarizes non-vested unit awards with service requirements only and those tied to service requirements and performance measures as of June 30, 2022, as well as activity for the fiscal year then ended:\n54\n1\nGranted includes restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards at 100% achievement.\n2\nForfeited includes restricted stock unit awards and performance unit awards forfeited for service requirements not met and performance unit awards not settled due to underachievement of performance measures.\nThe\n135\nunit awards granted in fiscal 2022 had service requirements and performance measures, with\n87\nonly having service requirements. The unit awards with only service requirements were valued at the weighted average fair value of the non-vested units based on the fair market value of the Company’s equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period, consistent with the methodology for calculating compensation expense on such awards.\nThe remaining\n48\nunit awards granted in fiscal 2022 have performance targets along with service requirements.\n19\nof these performance and service requirement unit awards were valued at grant by estimating 100% payout at release and using the fair market value of the Company equity shares on the grant date, less the present value of expected future dividends to be declared during the vesting period. The payout at release of approximately half of these unit awards will be determined based on the Company's compound annual growth rate (\"CAGR\") for revenue (excluding adjustments) for the three-year vesting period compared against goal thresholds as defined in the award agreement. The performance payout at release of the other half of these unit awards will be determined based on the expansion of the Company's non-GAAP operating margin over the three-year vesting period compared against goal thresholds as defined in the award agreement. The other\n29\nperformance and service requirement unit awards were valued at grant using a Monte Carlo pricing model as of the measurement date customized to the specific provisions of the Company’s plan design. Per the Company's award vesting and settlement provisions, the awards that utilized a Monte Carlo pricing model were valued at grant on the basis of Total Shareholder Return (\"TSR\") in comparison to the custom peer group (\"Compensation Peer Group\") comprised of the Standard & Poor's 1500 Software & Services Index (\"S&P 1500 S&S Index\") participant companies and other participants approved by the Compensation Committee of the Company's Board of Directors for fiscal year 2022. For fiscal years 2021 and 2020, TSR was in comparison to two separate groups—a custom peer group, the Compensation Peer Group in the table below, and the Standard & Poor's 1500 Information Technology Index (\"S&P 1500 IT Index\") participants—as approved by the Compensation Committee for each of those fiscal years. TSR is defined as the change in the stock price through the performance period plus dividends per share paid during the performance period, all divided by the stock price at the beginning of the performance period.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the Monte Carlo pricing model to estimate fair value at the grant dates for awards with performance targets and service requirements are as follows:\n55\n1\nFor fiscal 2022,  S&P 1500 S&S Index participants were included in the Compensation Peer Group.\nAt June 30, 2022, there was $\n19,076\nof compensation expense, excluding forfeitures, that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock unit awards, which will be recognized over a weighted-average remaining contractual term of\n1.12\nyears.\nThe fair value of restricted units at vest date totaled $\n12,139\n, $\n21,652\n, and $\n11,248\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 11.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe following table reflects the reconciliation between basic and diluted earnings per share.\nPer share information is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding for each of the fiscal years. Stock options, restricted stock units, and restricted stock have been included in the calculation of earnings per share to the extent they are dilutive. The two-class method for computing EPS has not been applied because no outstanding awards contain non-forfeitable rights to participate in dividends. There were\n7\nanti-dilutive weighted average shares excluded from the weighted average shares outstanding for diluted earnings per share for fiscal 2022,\n11\nshares were excluded for fiscal 2021, and\n2\nshares were excluded for fiscal 2020.\nNOTE 12.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nThe Company established an employee stock purchase plan in 2006. The plan allows the majority of employees the opportunity to directly purchase shares of the Company at\n85\n% of the closing price of the Company's stock on or around the fifteenth day of each month. During the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022\n,\n2021 and 2020, employees\n56\npurchased\n80\n,\n80\n, and\n74\nshares under this plan at average prices of $\n147.36\n, $\n136.87\n, and $\n132.51\n, respectively. As of June 30, 2022, approximately\n1,070\nshares remained available for future issuance under the plan. The plan does not meet the criteria as a non-compensatory plan. As a result, the Company records the total dollar value of the stock discount given to employees under the plan as expense.\nThe Company has a defined contribution plan for its employees: the 401(k) Retirement Savings Plan (the “Plan”). The Plan is subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1975 (“ERISA”) as amended. Under the Plan, the Company matches\n100\n% of full-time employee contributions up to\n5\n% of eligible compensation. In order to receive matching contributions, employees must be\n18\nyears of age and be employed for at least\nsix months\n. The Company has the option of making a discretionary contribution; however,\nnone\nhas been made for any of the three most recent fiscal years. The total matching contributions for the Plan were $\n28,259\n, $\n26,783\n, and $\n25,155\nfor the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022\n,\n2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNOTE 13.\nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nGeezeo\nOn\nJuly 1, 2019\n, the Company acquired all of the equity interest of Geezeo for $\n37,776\npaid in cash. The primary reason for the acquisition was to expand the Company's digital financial management solutions and the purchase was funded by cash generated from operations. Geezeo is a Boston-based provider of retail and business digital financial management solutions.\nCosts incurred related to the acquisition of Geezeo in fiscal 2020 totaled $\n30\nfor professional services, travel, and other fees, and were expensed as incurred and reported within cost of revenue and selling, general, and administrative expense.\nThe Company's consolidated statement of income for the fiscal years ended June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020 included revenue of $\n12,733\n, $\n13,233\n, and $\n8,969\n, respectively, and after-tax net income of $\n4,679\n, $\n4,805\n, and $\n654\n, respectively, resulting from Geezeo's operations.\nThe accompanying consolidated statement of income for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2020 does not include any revenues and expenses related to this acquisition prior to the acquisition date. The impact of this acquisition was considered immaterial to the current and prior periods of our consolidated financial statements and pro forma financial information has not been provided.\nNOTE 14.\nREPORTABLE SEGMENT INFORMATION\nThe Company is a leading provider of technology solutions and payment processing services primarily for financial services organizations.\nThe Company’s operations are classified into\nfour\nreportable segments: Core, Payments, Complementary, and Corporate and Other. The Core segment provides core information processing platforms to banks and credit unions, which consist of integrated applications required to process deposit, loan, and general ledger transactions, and maintain centralized customer/member information. The Payments segment provides secure payment processing tools and services, including ATM, debit, and credit card processing services, online and mobile bill pay solutions, and risk management products and services. The Complementary segment provides additional software and services that can be integrated with the Company's core solutions or used independently. The Corporate and Other segment includes revenue and costs from hardware and other products not attributable to the other three segments, as well as operating costs not directly attributable to the other three segments.\nThe Company evaluates the performance of its segments and allocates resources to them based on various factors, including performance against trend, budget, and forecast. Only revenue and costs of revenue are considered in the evaluation for each segment.\nImmaterial adjustments were made in fiscal 2022 to reclassify cost of revenue in fiscal 2021 from the Core segment to the Corporate and Other segment to be consistent with the current fiscal year allocation of cost of revenue by segment. The amounts reclassified for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2021, were $\n135\n.\nDuring the second quarter of fiscal 2021, the Company's call center was consolidated into the Complementary segment.
