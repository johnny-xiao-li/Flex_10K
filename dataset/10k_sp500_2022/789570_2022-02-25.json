    "text": "MGM Resorts International is referred to as the “Company,” “MGM Resorts,” or the “Registrant,” and together with its subsidiaries may also be referred to as “we,” “us” or “our.” MGM China Holdings Limited together with its subsidiaries is referred to as “MGM China.” Except where the context indicates otherwise, “MGP” refers to MGM Growth Properties LLC together with its consolidated subsidiaries.\nOverview\nMGM Resorts International is a Delaware corporation incorporated in 1986 that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts across the United States and in Macau.\nWe believe we operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities. We believe we operate the highest quality resorts in each of the markets in which we operate. Ensuring our resorts are the premier resorts in their respective markets requires capital investments to maintain the best possible experiences for our guests.\nMGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), is a consolidated subsidiary of the Company. Substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its businesses are conducted through its subsidiary MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). As of December 31, 2021, we lease the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements, and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding the master lease with MGP, which eliminates in consolidation.\nWe lease the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 5% owned by such subsidiary and 95% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”, and such venture, the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”).\nWe lease the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and a venture that is 50.1% owned by a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and 49.9% owned by a subsidiary of BREIT (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”). We lease the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of ours and funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. (\"Blackstone\"). Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of these leases.\nBusiness Developments\nIn recent years, in furtherance of our vision to be the world’s premier gaming entertainment company, we have implemented an asset-light business model, which has involved a comprehensive review of our owned real estate assets to find opportunities to monetize those assets efficiently and allow unlocked capital to be redeployed towards balance sheet improvements, new growth opportunities, and to return value to our shareholders. At the same time, we have continued to focus on key growth opportunities that align with our vision, particularly by investing in U.S. online sports betting and iGaming through BetMGM, expanding our digital capabilities, and seeking to diversify our Asia operations with development efforts in Japan.\nAs part of that business strategy, we have sought, and executed on, opportunities to invest in our growth areas, divest our real estate assets, and acquire, or enter into venture transactions with respect to the operations of integrated casino, hotel, and entertainment resorts, including through the following transactions:\n•\nIn July 2018, we and Entain plc (“Entain”) formed BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), a venture that is owned 50% by each party. In connection with its formation, we provided BetMGM with exclusive access to all of our domestic landbased and online sports betting, major tournament poker, and online gaming operations and Entain provided BetMGM with exclusive access to its technology in the United States.\n•\nIn January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino (\"Empire City\") for total consideration of approximately $865 million. Subsequently, MGP acquired\n1\nEmpire City’s developed real property from us and Empire City was added to the master lease between us and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for additional information.\n•\nIn March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease between us and MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas property (the “Park MGM Transaction”). Refer to Note 18 for additional information on this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.\n•\nAdditionally, in\nNovember 2019, Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us for total consideration of $4.25 billion, and leased such assets back to us pursuant to a lease agreement.\nRefer to Note 11  for additional information relating to the lease and Note 12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.\n•\nIn December 2019, we completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million.\nSee Note 16 for additional information related to this transaction.\n•\nOn February 14, 2020, we completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to the newly formed MGP BREIT Venture in exchange for total consideration of $4.6 billion. See Note 1 for further discussion on the transaction and Note 12 for the guarantee entered into in connection with the transaction.\n•\nIn connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. Additionally, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18.  Refer to Note 11 for additional information relating to the lease.\n•\nAlso, on January 14, 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into a waiver agreement pursuant to which  approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on May 18, 2020 and approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that we held were redeemed for $700 million on December 2, 2020. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.  Refer to Note 1 for further information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.\n•\nOn March 4, 2021, we delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million Operating Partnership units that we held which was satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP's issuance of Class A shares. See Note 13 for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.\n•\nOn August 4, 2021, we entered into an agreement with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”) and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we will receive 1.366 units of the new VICI operating partnership (“VICI OP”) in exchange for each Operating Partnership unit held by us. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the majority of our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion. MGP’s Class B share that is held by us will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, we will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021). Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n•\nOn September 26, 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (\"The Cosmopolitan\") for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Additionally, the Company will enter into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\n•\nOn September 27, 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter Holdings, LLC (\"CityCenter\") held by Infinity World Development Corp (\"Infinity World\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity, for cash consideration of $2.125 billion. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on this acquisition.\n2\n•\nOn September 28, 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) to funds managed by Blackstone for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease through which the real property is leased back to a subsidiary of the Company. Refer to Note 11 for discussion of the lease agreement.\n•\nOn September 28, 2021, we announced that we, together\nwith our venture partner, ORIX Corporation (\"ORIX\"), were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner.  In December 2021, we and ORIX formed a venture, through which we will bid to develop one of Japan's first integrated resorts.\n•\nOn October 29, 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us for cash consideration of $400 million and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master lease between us and MGP through which MGP leases back the real property to a subsidiary of ours. Transactions with MGP, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in our consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.\n•\nOn December 13, 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc. (\"Hard Rock\") for cash consideration of $\n1.075\nbillion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Upon closing, the master lease between us and VICI (or MGP in the event that the VICI Transaction is terminated) will be amended and restated to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or termination of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals. Refer to Note 1 for further information.\nFor additional information relating to our acquisitions, divestitures, venture transactions, and other arrangements, including those referred to above, see “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” as well as the notes to our consolidated financial statements specified above.\nFinancial Impact of COVID-19.\nSee “Item 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Description of our business and key performance indicators — Financial Impact of COVID-19” for more information about the effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on our business and our recovery. For a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions.”\nResort Operations\nGeneral\nMost of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, acquisitions or investments, and repay debt financings.\nOur results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature as all of our casino resorts, except as otherwise described related to the impact of COVID-19, typically operate 24 hours a day, every day of the year, with the exception of Empire City, which operates 20 hours a day, every day of the year, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. Our primary casino and hotel operations are owned and managed by us. Other resort amenities may be owned and operated by us, owned by us but managed by third parties for a fee, or leased to third parties. We also lease space to third-party retail and food and beverage operators, particularly for branding opportunities.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have three reportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations, and MGM China, as generally described below. See Note 17 for detailed financial information about our reportable segments.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts consists of the following casino resorts:\nAria (including Vdara) (upon acquisition in September 2021), Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), Mandalay Bay (including Delano and Four Seasons), The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York (including The Park), Excalibur, Park MGM (including NoMad Las Vegas) and Circus Circus Las Vegas (until the sale of such property in December 2019).\nRegional Operations.\nRegional Operations consists of the following casino resorts: MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan; Beau Rivage in Biloxi, Mississippi; Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica, Mississippi; Borgata in Atlantic City, New\n3\nJersey; MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland; MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts; Empire City in Yonkers, New York (upon its acquisition in January 2019); and MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio (upon MGM’s acquisition of the operations from MGP in April 2019).\nOver half of the net revenue from our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is typically derived from non-gaming operations, including hotel, food and beverage, entertainment and other non-gaming amenities and the majority of the net revenue from our Regional Operations is typically derived from gaming operations. Although our domestic customer mix has changed in the near term as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, our long-term strategy continues to be to market to different customers and utilize our significant convention and meeting facilities to allow us to maximize hotel occupancy and customer volumes, which also leads to better labor utilization. Our operating results are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties, which in turn affects the price we can charge for our hotel rooms and other amenities.\nOur casino operations feature a variety of slots and table games, and, through BetMGM, we offer online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions in the United States. In addition, we provide our premium players access to high-limit rooms and lounge experiences where players may enjoy an upscale atmosphere.\nMGM China\nWe own approximately 56% of MGM China, which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”), the Macau company that owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai casino resorts and holds the related gaming subconcession and land concessions. We believe our ownership interest in MGM China plays an important role in extending our reach internationally and will foster future growth and profitability. Although visitation during 2020 and 2021 was significantly reduced by the COVID-19 pandemic, we expect the long-term future growth of the Asian gaming market to drive additional visitation at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.\nOur current MGM China operations relate to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, discussed further below. MGM China’s revenues are generated primarily from gaming operations which are conducted under a gaming subconcession held by MGM Grand Paradise, a subsidiary of MGM China. The Macau government has granted three gaming concessions and each of these concessionaires has granted a subconcession. The MGM Grand Paradise gaming subconcession was granted by SJM Resorts S.A. (\"SJMSA\", formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), which expires in June 2022. The Macau government currently prohibits additional concessions and subconcessions, but does not place a limit on the number of casinos or gaming areas operated by the concessionaires and subconcessionaires, though additional casinos or gaming areas require government approval prior to commencing operations. See “Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Macau Operations — The Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, or MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.”\nAs discussed above, gaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires, of which a subsidiary of MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise, is a subconcessionaire. In 2019, the expiration of MGM Grand Paradise's subconcession term was extended from March 31, 2020 to June 26, 2022, consistent with the expiration of the other concessionaires and subconcessionaires. Pursuant to the current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill, the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, the casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM Grand Paradise will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and an event of default under MGM China’s revolving credit facilities. MGM\n4\nChina continues to closely monitor developments regarding the retendering process or concession extensions including the issuance of guidance by the Macau Government. MGM China intends to respond proactively to all relevant Macau Government requirements when known relating to the retendering process. We cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that we will be able to obtain a gaming concession in a public tender; however, management believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held.\nCorporate and Other\nWe have additional business activities including our investments in unconsolidated affiliates, and certain other corporate and management operations. Our unconsolidated affiliates include the ventures with BREIT, discussed elsewhere, and BetMGM. In September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.\n5\nOur Operating Resorts\nWe have provided certain information below about our resorts as of December 31, 2021.\n(1)\nCasino square footage is approximate and includes the gaming floor, race and sports, high limit areas and casino specific walkways, and excludes casino cage and other non-gaming space within the casino area.\n(2)\nIncludes slot machines, video poker machines and other electronic gaming devices. Also include 172 and 187 gaming devices temporarily out of service due to COVID-19 restrictions at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, respectively.\n(3)\nIncludes blackjack (“21”), baccarat, craps, roulette and other table games; does not include poker. MGM China gaming tables reflect the permanent table count, excludes temporary tables.\n(4)\nIncludes 1,495 condominium-hotel units at Vdara, which are predominantly utilized as company-owned hotel rooms.\n(5)\nIncludes 1,078 rooms at The Signature at MGM Grand Las Vegas.\n(6)\nIncludes 1,117 rooms at the Delano and 424 rooms at the Four Seasons Hotel.\n(7)\nIncludes 293 rooms at NoMad Las Vegas.\n(8)\nOur local investors have an ownership interest of approximately 3% of MGM Grand Detroit.\n(9)\nOur local investors have a non-voting economic interest in MGM National Harbor. Refer to Note 2 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further description of such interest.\n(10)\nOur local investor has a non-voting economic interest in MGM Springfield.\n6\nCustomers and Competition\nOur properties operate in highly competitive environments. We compete against gaming companies, as well as other hospitality companies in the markets in which we operate, neighboring markets, and in other parts of the world, including non-gaming resort destinations such as Hawaii. Our gaming operations compete to a lesser extent with state-sponsored lotteries, off-track wagering, card parlors, iGaming and other forms of legalized gaming in the United States and internationally. For further discussion of the potential impact of competitive conditions on our business, see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions — We face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flow.”\nOur primary methods of successful competition include:\n•\nLocating our resorts in desirable leisure and business travel markets and operating at superior sites within those markets;\n•\nConstructing and maintaining high-quality resorts and facilities, including luxurious guestrooms, state-of-the-art convention facilities and premier dining, entertainment, retail and other amenities;\n•\nRecruiting, training and retaining well-qualified and motivated employees who provide superior customer service;\n•\nProviding unique, “must-see” entertainment attractions; and\n•\nDeveloping distinctive and memorable marketing, promotional and customer loyalty programs.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations\nOur customers include premium gaming customers; leisure and wholesale travel customers; business travelers, and group customers, including conventions, trade associations, and small meetings. We have a diverse portfolio of properties, which appeal to the upper end of each market segment and also cater to leisure and value-oriented tour and travel customers. Many of our properties have significant convention and meeting space which we utilize to drive business to our properties during midweek and off-peak periods.\nOur Las Vegas casino resorts compete for customers with a large number of other hotel casinos in the Las Vegas area, including major hotel casinos on or near the Las Vegas Strip, major hotel casinos in the downtown area, which is about five miles from the center of the Las Vegas Strip, and several major hotel casinos elsewhere in the Las Vegas area. Our Las Vegas Strip Resorts also compete, in part, with each other. Major competitors, including new entrants, have either recently expanded their hotel room capacity and convention space offerings, or have plans to expand their capacity or construct new resorts in Las Vegas. Also, the growth of gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas.\nOutside Nevada, our resorts primarily compete with other hotel casinos in their markets and for customers in surrounding regional gaming markets, where location is a critical factor to success. In addition, we compete with gaming operations in surrounding jurisdictions and other leisure destinations in each region.\nMGM China\nThe three primary customer bases in the Macau gaming market are VIP gaming operations, main floor gaming operations and slot machine operations. VIP gaming play has historically been sourced both internally and externally. Externally sourced VIP gaming play was obtained through external gaming promoters who assist VIP players with their travel and entertainment arrangements. Gaming promoters have been compensated through payment of revenue-sharing arrangements and rolling chip turnover-based commissions. In-house VIP players also typically receive a commission based on the program in which they participate. Unlike gaming promoters and in-house VIP players, main floor players do not receive commissions. The profit contribution from the main floor gaming operations has historically exceeded the VIP gaming operations due to commission costs paid to gaming promoters. We offer amenities to attract players such as premium gaming lounges and stadium-style electronic table games terminals, which include both table games and slots to create a dedicated exclusive gaming space for premium main floor players’ use, as well as non-gaming amenities, such as The Mansion and MGM Cotai Emerald Villa to attract ultra-high end customers.\nVIP gaming at MGM China is conducted by the use of special purpose nonnegotiable gaming chips. Gaming promoters currently purchase these nonnegotiable chips and in turn they sell these chips to their players. The nonnegotiable chips allow us to track the amount of wagering conducted by each gaming promoters’ clients in order to determine VIP gaming play. Gaming promoter commissions are currently based on a percentage of the gross table games win or a percentage of the table games turnover they generate. They also receive a complimentary allowance based on a percentage of the table games turnover they generate, which can be applied to hotel rooms, food and beverage and other discretionary\n7\ncustomer-related expenses. Gaming promoter commissions are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. In-house VIP commissions are based on a percentage of rolling chip turnover and are recorded as a reduction of casino revenue.\nIn December 2021, we suspended operations with our primary gaming promoters. In January 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend the gaming law which includes some restrictions relating to gaming promoters, including: each gaming promoter can only exercise the activity of gaming promotion for one concessionaire, revenue sharing arrangements between concessionaires and gaming promoters are prohibited, gaming promoters are prohibited from having exclusive operation of casino reserved areas, and gaming promoters are restricted to only providing support to the concessionaires in the promotion of casino gaming activities through commissions. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly.\nWe have focused our business on main floor gaming operations and, accordingly, we do not expect VIP gaming operations to be a significant source of revenue in future years. The majority of MGM China's casino revenue has been provided by main floor gaming operations in recent years and we expect this customer base will be the primary source of growth in the future.\nOur key competitors in Macau include five other gaming concessionaires and subconcessionaires. If the Macau government were to grant additional concessions or subconcessions, we would face additional competition which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, we face competition at our Macau and Cotai properties from concessionaires who have expanded their operations, primarily on the Cotai Strip.\nWe encounter competition from major gaming centers located in other areas of Asia and around the world including, but not limited to, Singapore, South Korea, Vietnam, Cambodia, the Philippines, Australia, and Las Vegas.\nMarketing\nOur marketing efforts are conducted through various means, including our loyalty programs. We advertise on radio, television, internet and billboards and in newspapers and magazines in selected cities throughout the United States and overseas, as well as by direct mail, email and through the use of social media. We also advertise through our regional marketing offices located in major U.S. and foreign cities. Our direct marketing efforts utilize advanced analytic techniques that identify customer preferences and help predict future customer behavior, allowing us to make more relevant offers to customers, influence incremental visits, and help build lasting customer relationships.\nMGM Rewards, our customer loyalty program, is a tiered program and allows customers to qualify for benefits across our participating resorts and in both gaming and non-gaming areas, encouraging customers to keep their total spend within our casino resorts. In January 2022, we redesigned our loyalty program to expand the ways in which our customers can earn benefits. We also offer the Golden Lion Club for gaming focused customers, in addition to M life Rewards, at MGM China. The structured rewards systems based on member value and tier level ensure that customers can progressively access the full range of services that the resorts provide. Our loyalty programs focus on building a rewarding relationship with our customers, encouraging members to increase both visitation and spend.\nStrategy\nWe strive to be a leader in the global gaming, entertainment and hospitality industry that delivers extraordinary entertainment across a portfolio of properties in the United States and Macau. The quality of our properties and amenities is evidenced by our success in winning numerous awards, both domestic and globally, including several Four and Five Diamond designations from the American Automobile Association, multiple Four and Five Star designations from Forbes Travel Guide and numerous certifications of our Corporate Social Responsibility efforts.\nIn order to achieve our vision of becoming the world's premier gaming entertainment company, we developed our strategic plan, which centers on four pillars:\n•\nStrong People and Culture.\nRecruit, develop and retain the best talent. Foster a culture of diversity and inclusion. Invest in the employee experience.\n•\nCustomer-Centric Model\n.\nLeverage a customer-centric model reinforced by a strong brand and deep customer insights to provide unmatched entertainment experiences for our guests and drive top-line growth.\n•\nOperational Excellence\n.\nOperating model refinement to maximize operating efficiencies and expand margins. Enhancement of digital capabilities to strengthen customer loyalty.\n•\nDisciplined Capital Allocation to Maximize Shareholder Value.\nPursuit of targeted, attractive ROI opportunities that align to our strategic vision. Focus on shareholder returns. Fortify balance sheet.\n8\nDue to the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting rapidly changing environment, our strategic direction must allow for flexibility. The strategic plan was developed with the intent to regularly revisit, measure, and reevaluate for emerging opportunities.\nIn allocating resources, our financial strategy is focused on managing a proper mix of investments in our existing properties, strategic growth opportunities, debt repayment and shareholder returns. We believe there are reasonable investments for us to make in new initiatives and at our current resorts that will provide profitable returns.\nWe regularly evaluate targeted opportunities that provide an attractive return on investment in domestic and international markets, including the ownership, management and operation of gaming facilities and accessing new markets for iGaming and online sports betting. We also leverage our management expertise and well-recognized brands through strategic partnerships and international expansion opportunities. We feel that several of our brands are well-suited to new projects in both gaming and non-gaming developments. We may undertake these opportunities either alone or in cooperation with one or more third parties.\nWe continue to invest in our operating model by expanding the footprint of our Centers of Excellence and enabling best in class operations through adjustments within corporate and property business units. In addition, we have implemented several improvement and cost cutting initiatives comprised of labor, sourcing, and revenue programs that have further improved our operating model and have positioned us as a stronger company.\nWe have continued to focus on our key growth opportunities of developing an integrated resort in Japan and investing in BetMGM. In September 2021, we, together with our venture partner, ORIX, were selected by Osaka as the region’s integrated resort partner. This selection marks an important step in our long-term bid to develop one of Japan’s first integrated casino resorts. We are currently working with Osaka to submit an area development plan to the central government during the application period. As it relates to BetMGM, we believe that BetMGM is positioned as a long-term leader in the U.S. online sports betting and iGaming industries. As part of our commitment to the success of  BetMGM, we have integrated our MGM Rewards program with BetMGM and have BetMGM branded on-property sportsbooks and kiosks to drive higher value customers at lower acquisition costs through a robust omni-channel strategy. Further, we continue to explore bringing full-scale commercial gaming to Empire City in New York.\nTechnology\nWe believe technology, digital and advanced data science/analytics capabilities are critical to optimizing customer experience and loyalty, employee productivity and engagement, operational efficiency and revenue growth. We are focused on using these capabilities to achieve specific goals of creating ‘only at MGM’ differentiation through unique content and experiences, establishing a perennial engagement with our guests for increased loyalty, digital diversification through enhanced e-commerce and seamless integration of the physical integrated resorts business with digital casino and sports betting businesses, creating cross-property experiences and promotions in Las Vegas to provide much better value to the consumer, enhancing our data driven decisioning capabilities in all aspects of our business for faster decision making, and optimizing our operations and employee productivity and experience through digitization.\nEnvironmental & Social Responsibility\nAt MGM Resorts we have had a long-standing commitment to environmental and social responsibility. For over a decade, we have had a dedicated board committee focused on Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”). In 2019, we had bolstered governance of these topics by uniting our key pillars of Diversity and Inclusion, Philanthropy and Community Engagement and Environmental Sustainability under one Executive Committee-level leader who manages the MGM Resorts Social Impact and Sustainability Center of Excellence, reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and serves as liaison to the CSR and Sustainability board committee. This leader now also oversees the Human Resources function, and is thus able to integrate Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) considerations more deeply into the core culture of our organization.\nThe year 2021 was a critical one in terms of progress on our ESG initiatives. In May 2021, we published our 2020 Social Impact & Sustainability Report containing our most robust ESG disclosures to date. In this report we showed the significant progress made towards many of our ESG goals that we had announced publicly in prior reports, and we expect to publish a report in 2022 reflecting our progress on these goals during 2021.\nImportantly, 2021 saw the opening of the 100MW “MGM Resorts Mega Solar Array” in North Las Vegas. This is the hospitality industry’s largest direct-connect renewable electricity project world-wide and has significantly improved our trajectory to achieve our previously announced carbon reduction goals. In connection with the opening of this array, we enhanced our climate ambition by announcing two new 2030 goals: to cut global total operational carbon emissions by\n9\n50%, and source 100% renewable electricity in the USA. Beyond the environmental benefits associated with the renewable electricity generated, the array will also help us hedge our electricity costs and reduce our exposure to price volatility risks.\nIn 2021, we also made substantial progress against our commitment to aligning more of our ESG report disclosures to leading ESG frameworks by publishing our first ever disclosures informed by guidelines of the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainability Accounting Standards Board (SASB) Hotels & Lodging and Casinos & Gaming Sector Standards.\nOur full list of ESG goals and performance against them are available in our 2020 Social Impact & Sustainability Report, available at mgmresorts.com/focused. The content on this website and report is for informational purposes only and such content is not incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nTrademarks\nOur principal intellectual property consists of trademarks for, among others, Aria, Vdara, Bellagio, The Mirage, Borgata, Mandalay Bay, MGM, MGM Grand, MGM Resorts International, Luxor, Excalibur, New York-New York, Beau Rivage and Empire City, all of which have been registered or allowed in various classes in the United States. In addition, we have also registered or applied to register numerous other trademarks in connection with our properties, facilities and development projects in the United States and in various other foreign jurisdictions. These trademarks are brand names under which we market our properties and services. We consider these brand names to be important to our business since they have the effect of developing brand identification. We believe that the name recognition, reputation and image that we have developed attract customers to our facilities. Once granted, our trademark registrations are of perpetual duration so long as they are used and periodically renewed. It is our intent to pursue and maintain our trademark registrations consistent with our goals for brand development and identification, and enforcement of our trademark rights.\nHuman Capital\nWe are focused on fostering a people-driven culture exemplified by how we lead and uphold our core values, which in 2021 evolved to: captivate our audience, inspire excellence, champion inclusion, and win together, to create an engaged and diverse workforce. Our long-term people strategy is designed to enhance talent attraction and development to support business objectives, guest experience, community engagement, and financial goals. Our workforce development strategies support local hiring and developing a robust workforce in the local communities in which we operate through veteran support, community training and employment, fulfilling local hiring commitments (where applicable), and through internship and management development programs.\nGrowth and Development\nWe invest significant resources to develop the talent needed, now and in the future, to continue to be a premier employer of choice across the gaming, hospitality, and entertainment industries. We are committed to a culture of continuous learning where employees, at all levels, are engaged in developing their knowledge, skills, and abilities and we support the long-term career aspirations of our employees through education and professional/personal development. In 2021, we introduced several new learning and development initiatives focused on a broad range of employee segments.  Except as otherwise temporarily impacted due to COVID-19, we offer tuition reimbursement, contribute toward student loan debt repayment, and have partnered with the Nevada System of Higher Education to allow employees to earn a degree online free of charge for all credit hours.\nEquity, Diversity, and Inclusion (“ED&I”)\nOur approach to ED&I is anchored by our corporate and people strategies and a social impact and sustainability approach that centers on embracing humanity and protecting the planet. A concise framework lays out four strategic pillars to guide our work: invest in people; build an inclusive culture; grow business and customer engagement and supplier diversity; and, enhance marketplace leadership and community relations. As part of our commitment, we have committed to the following four long-range goals: (1) ensure that all employees have equal access to leadership opportunities, (2) spend at least 10% of our biddable procurement with diverse suppliers, (3) expand our Supplier Diversity Mentorship Program to achieve 50 graduates and (4) train 100% of management employees on social impact policies and goals. In connection with each goal, we have established robust key performance indicators, which are tracked and published in our annual Social Impact and Sustainability Report.In addition, we have detailed internal Human Capital workforce reports, which include demographic and diversity data, and are reviewed with the Corporate Social Responsibility and Sustainability Committee of the Board, leadership teams and executive management on a regular basis.\n10\nInternally, we use multiple channels to facilitate communication and to continuously advance our core value of inclusiveness. The channels include but are not limited to open forums with executives, employee engagement surveys with detailed action planning, and employee network groups.\nWork in the area of equity, diversity and inclusion is advanced through a range of programs and initiatives which include education and training, community partnerships, recruitment and talent development, advocacy, engagement and outreach. Responsibility is driven and led by the Company’s Chief People, Inclusion and Sustainability Officer, who reports directly to the Chief Executive Officer and President, and is supported by a centralized diversity and inclusion team and the Human Resources department.\nHealth, Safety, and Wellness\nIn order to promote our culture of overall employee health and wellness we provide benefits, tools and resources to help maintain or improve physical, mental, and financial health. We continue to align benefit offerings to the needs of a diverse workforce across an expanded regional presence and leverage innovative solutions to expand access to health and wellness resources, including the recent addition of a service to help connect LGBTQIA+ people and their loved ones with culturally and clinically competent health care providers.\nTo ensure our employees' continued health, safety, and wellness in response to COVID-19, we coordinated with medical experts to put in place extensive testing protocols for our employees and required COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of employment for all salaried employees and new hires throughout the United States. As a commitment to our employees impacted by the pandemic, we have maintained benefits eligibility for many employees who were furloughed in 2020 and were unable to work enough hours to qualify for benefits until business conditions improved.\nCommunity Engagement and Philanthropy\nOur philanthropic focus centers around:\nEmbracing Humanity and Protecting the Planet\n. We organize our major programs and initiatives under the pillars of\ncaring for one another\nand\ninvesting in the community\n. We established the MGM Resorts Foundation in 2002 as an engagement opportunity for employees to contribute to charitable causes, which provides two types of grants (1) the Employee Emergency Grant, which benefits our employees, and (2) the Community Grant, which benefits local communities. We endeavor to care for our communities through volunteerism and philanthropy and encourage all of our employees to volunteer through a variety of programs. In addition, we offer opportunities for our employees to give back to their communities, including through programs such as VolunteerREWARDS, which provides employees with opportunities to earn grant money to their charity of choice based on volunteer hours.\nEmployees and Labor Relations\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately 42,000 full-time and 17,000 part-time employees domestically. In addition, we had approximately 10,000 employees at MGM China. We had collective bargaining agreements with unions covering approximately 35,000 of our employees as of December 31, 2021. Collective bargaining agreements covering multiple bargaining units at our Regional Operations and Las Vegas Strip Resorts  are scheduled to expire in 2022. This includes all bargaining units at Gold Strike Tunica in Mississippi, all bargaining units at Borgata in Atlantic City, our hotel/food & beverage bargaining unit at MGM National Harbor, and all valet operations in Las Vegas (with the exception of The Signature). Negotiations for successor contracts covering those employees are being scheduled as expiration dates approach and will continue throughout 2022. As of December 31, 2021, none of the employees of MGM China are part of a labor union and the MGM China resorts are not party to any collective bargaining agreements.\nGovernment Regulation and Licensing\nThe gaming industry is highly regulated, and we must maintain our licenses and pay gaming taxes to continue our operations. Each of our casinos is subject to extensive regulation under the laws, rules and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it is located. These laws, rules and regulations generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners, managers, and persons with financial interest in the gaming operations. Violations of laws in one jurisdiction could result in disciplinary action in other jurisdictions.\nA more detailed description of the gaming regulations to which we are subject is contained in Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K, which Exhibit is incorporated herein by reference.\nOur businesses are subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes (including regulations under\n11\nthe Americans with Disabilities Act, which requires all public accommodations to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by persons with disabilities), construction, land use and marketing and advertising. We also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to various reporting and anti-money laundering regulations. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Material changes, new laws or regulations, or material differences in interpretations by courts or governmental authorities could adversely affect our operating results.\nIn addition, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act and the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. Under various federal, state and local laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. We have not identified any issues associated with our properties that could reasonably be expected to have an adverse effect on us or the results of our operations.\nFor a discussion of potential risks to our business relating to regulatory matters, including due to the potential impact of legislative and regulatory changes, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy.”\nCautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements\nThis Form 10-K and our 2021 Annual Report to Stockholders contain “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

In evaluating us, you should consider carefully, among other things, the risks described below.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nThe following is a summary of the principal risks that could adversely affect our business, operations and financial results.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments\n•\nOur substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide on the indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations.\n•\nCurrent and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures.\n•\nThe agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations.\n•\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes.\nRisks Related to Our Announced Transactions\n•\nThe VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction, and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\n•\nThe potential litigation instituted against us, our transaction counterparties, or our respective directors challenging the VICI Transaction may prevent such transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions\n•\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\n•\nWe face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nOur business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside.\n•\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan.\n15\n•\nOur ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements.\n•\nAll of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\n•\nPaul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP.\n•\nDespite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives.\n•\nBecause a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified.\n•\nWe extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables.\n•\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits.\n•\nLeisure and business travel, especially travel by air, are particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events, such as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases.\n•\nCo-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk.\n•\nAny of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects.\n•\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future.\n•\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business.\n•\nA significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.\n•\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results.\n•\nWe may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful.\n•\nThe failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data.\n•\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\n•\nWe are subject to risks and costs related to climate change.\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy\n•\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations.\n•\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us.\n•\nIf the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected.\n•\nThe future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods.\n•\nWe face risks related to pending claims that have been, or future claims that may be, brought against us.\nRisks Related to Our Macau Operations\n•\nWe have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China.\n•\nThe Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise, exercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022, or MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of\n16\nwhich would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n•\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States.\n•\nConflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China, the holding company for MGM Grand Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai.\nFor a more complete discussion of the material risks facing our business, please see below.\nRisks Related to Our Substantial Financial Commitments\nOur substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments, including the fixed component of our rent payments and guarantees we provide of the indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture could adversely affect our operations and financial results and impact our ability to satisfy our obligations\n.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately $12.9 billion of principal amount of indebtedness outstanding on a consolidated basis, including $4.3 billion of outstanding indebtedness of the Operating Partnership and $3.1 billion of outstanding indebtedness of MGM China. Any increase in the interest rates applicable to our existing or future borrowings would increase the cost of our indebtedness and reduce the cash flow available to fund our other liquidity needs. We do not guarantee MGM China’s or the Operating Partnership’s obligations under their respective debt agreements and, to the extent MGM China or the Operating Partnership were to cease to produce cash flow sufficient to service their indebtedness, our ability to make additional investments into such entities is limited by the covenants in our existing senior credit facility.\nIn addition, our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments could have important negative consequences on us, including:\n•\nincreasing our exposure to general adverse economic and industry conditions;\n•\nlimiting our flexibility to plan for, or react to, changes in our business and industry;\n•\nlimiting our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital requirements, capital expenditures, debt service requirements, execution of our business strategy (including returning value to our shareholders) or other general operating requirements;\n•\nmaking it more difficult for us to make payments on our indebtedness; or\n•\nplacing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to less-leveraged competitors.\nWe currently also provide shortfall guarantees of the $3.01 billion and $3.0 billion principal amount of indebtedness (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) of Bellagio BREIT Venture and MGP BREIT Venture, respectively. The terms of each guarantee provide that, after the lenders have exhausted certain remedies to collect on the obligations under the underlying indebtedness, we would then be responsible for any shortfall between the value of the collateral and the debt obligation, which amount may be material, and we may not have sufficient cash on hand to fund any such obligation to the extent it is triggered in the future. If we do not have sufficient cash on hand, we may need to raise capital, including incurring additional indebtedness, in order to satisfy our obligation. There can be no assurance that any financing will be available to us, or, if available, will be on terms that are satisfactory to us.\nMoreover, our businesses are capital intensive. For our owned, leased and managed resorts to remain attractive and competitive, we must periodically invest significant capital to keep the properties well-maintained, modernized and refurbished. The leases for our operating properties have fixed rental payments (with annual escalators) and also require us to apply a percentage of net revenues generated at the leased properties to capital expenditures at those properties. Such investments require an ongoing supply of cash and, to the extent that we cannot fund expenditures from cash generated by operations, funds must be borrowed or otherwise obtained. Similarly, development projects, including any potential future development of an integrated resort in Japan, strategic initiatives, including positioning BetMGM as a leader in online sports betting and iGaming, and acquisitions could require significant capital commitments, the incurrence of additional debt, guarantees of third-party debt or the incurrence of contingent liabilities, any or all of which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nCurrent and future economic, capital and credit market conditions could adversely affect our ability to service our substantial indebtedness and significant financial commitments or make planned expenditures\n.\nOur ability to make payments on our substantial indebtedness and other significant financial commitments, including the rent payments under our leases, and to fund planned or committed capital expenditures and other investments depends on our ability to generate cash flow, receive distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries (including MGM China and the Operating Partnership), and borrow under our senior credit facility or incur new indebtedness. In 2020 and 2021, the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in significant deterioration to the global economy, and substantial declines in our revenues from operations and expected distributions from our unconsolidated affiliates and subsidiaries. We expect that the recent\n17\nemergence and global spread of COVID-19 variants may continue to impact consumer spending levels in 2022 and potentially thereafter, and if we fail to generate cash sufficient to fund our liquidity needs or satisfy the financial and other covenants in our debt and lease instruments, we cannot assure you that future borrowings will be available to us under our senior secured credit facility in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or fund our other liquidity needs or that we will be able to access the capital markets in the future to borrow additional debt on terms favorable to us, or at all.\nIn addition, we have a significant amount of indebtedness maturing in 2022, and thereafter. Our ability to fund or timely refinance and replace our indebtedness will depend upon the economic and credit market conditions discussed above. If we are unable to fund or refinance our indebtedness on a timely basis, we might be forced to seek alternate forms of financing, dispose of certain assets or minimize capital expenditures and other investments. There is no assurance that any of these alternatives would be available to us, if at all, on satisfactory terms, on terms that would not be disadvantageous to us, or on terms that would not require us to breach the terms and conditions of our existing or future debt agreements or leases.\nThe agreements governing our senior credit facility and other senior indebtedness contain restrictions and limitations that could significantly affect our ability to operate our business, as well as significantly affect our liquidity, and therefore could adversely affect our results of operations\n.\nCovenants governing our senior secured credit facility and certain of our debt securities restrict, among other things, our ability to:\n•\npay dividends or distributions, repurchase equity, prepay certain debt or make certain investments;\n•\nincur additional debt;\n•\nincur liens on assets;\n•\nsell assets or consolidate with another company or sell all or substantially all of our assets;\n•\nenter into transactions with affiliates;\n•\nallow certain subsidiaries to transfer assets or enter into certain agreements; and\n•\nenter into sale and lease-back transactions.\nOur ability to comply with these provisions may be affected by events beyond our control. The breach of any such covenants or obligations not otherwise waived or cured could result in a default under the applicable debt obligations and could trigger acceleration of those obligations, which in turn could trigger cross-defaults under other agreements governing our long-term indebtedness. Any default under our senior credit facility or the indentures governing our other debt could adversely affect our growth, our financial condition, our results of operations and our ability to make payments on our debt and other financial commitments.\nIn addition, each of MGM China and the Operating Partnership has issued debt securities and is a borrower under credit facilities, all of which contain covenants that restrict the respective borrower’s ability to engage in certain transactions, require them to satisfy certain financial covenants and impose certain operating and financial restrictions on them and their respective subsidiaries. These restrictions include, among other things, limitations on their ability to pay dividends or distributions to us, incur additional debt, make investments or engage in other businesses, merge or consolidate with other companies, or transfer or sell assets.\nWe are required to pay a significant portion of our cash flows as rent, which could adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and growth initiatives, service our indebtedness and limit our ability to react to competitive and economic changes\n.\nAs of December 31, 2021 we are required to make annual rent payments of $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, under the triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also subject to annual escalators as described elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The leases also require us to spend a certain amount on capital expenditures at the leased properties. In addition, the leases governing the Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas, Mandalay Bay, Aria (including Vdara) real estate assets require us to comply with certain financial covenants which, if not met, will require us to deposit cash collateral or issue letters of credit for the benefit of the applicable landlord equal to 1 year of rent under the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease and the Aria lease and 2 years of rent under the Bellagio lease. As a result of the foregoing rent and capital expenditure obligations, our ability to fund our operations, raise capital, make acquisitions, make investments, service our debt and otherwise respond to competitive and economic changes may be adversely affected. For example, our obligations under the leases may:\n•\nmake it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations with respect to our indebtedness and to obtain additional indebtedness;\n•\nincrease our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions or a downturn in our business;\n•\nrequire us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to making rent payments, thereby reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital, capital expenditures, development projects, pay dividends, repurchase shares and other general corporate purposes;\n18\n•\nlimit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our business and the industry in which we operate;\n•\nrestrict our ability to make acquisitions, divestitures and engage in other significant transactions; and\n•\ncause us to lose our rights with respect to the applicable leased properties if we fail to pay rent or other amounts or otherwise default on the leases.\nAny of the above factors could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nRisks Related to Our Announced Transactions\nThe VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.\nEach of the VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction and The Mirage transaction is subject to certain closing conditions, which may not be satisfied within the anticipated timeframe or at all. For example, completion of the transactions remains subject to the receipt of certain regulatory approvals. There can be no assurance that any required regulatory approvals will be obtained, and the regulatory authorities from which approvals are required may impose conditions on the consummation of the transaction or require changes to the terms of the transaction or agreements to be entered into in connection with the transaction. Such conditions or changes and the process of obtaining regulatory approvals could have the effect of delaying or impeding the completion of the transactions, which might reduce the anticipated benefits to us of the transaction or have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. The completion of the VICI Transaction is also subject to the satisfaction of additional closing conditions, including, among others, (i) receipt of approval of VICI’s shareholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021), (ii) the absence of any restraining order, injunction or other judgment, order or decree from any applicable governmental authority prohibiting the consummation of the transaction, (iii) the effectiveness of the registration statement for VICI’s shares to be issued in the VICI Transaction and the authorization for listing of those shares on the New York Stock Exchange, (iv) the absence of a material adverse effect on the parties to the master transaction agreement, (v) the accuracy of each party’s representations and warranties in the master transaction agreement, subject to customary materiality standards, and (vi) compliance of each party with its respective covenants under the master transaction agreement. No assurance can be given that these or any other required conditions to closing will be satisfied. If the conditions precedent to the VICI Transaction are not satisfied, the VICI Transaction will not be completed unless such conditions are validly waived. Such conditions may jeopardize or delay the completion of the transaction or may reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction.\nIf any of the transactions are not completed, or are not completed on a timely basis, our business may be adversely affected and, without realizing any of the benefits of having completed such transactions, we may be subject to additional risks, costs and expenses, including, but not limited to, the following:\n•\nwe will be required to pay our costs relating to such transactions, such as legal, accounting, financial advisory and printing fees, whether or not the transactions are completed;\n•\nthe diversion of time and resources committed by our management to matters relating to the transactions could otherwise have been devoted to pursuing other beneficial opportunities;\n•\nwe may be subject to negative publicity or be negatively perceived by the investment or business communities as a result of the failure to consummate any or all of the transactions;\n•\nthe price of our shares may decline to the extent that the current market price of our shares reflects a higher price than it otherwise would have based on the assumption that any or all of the transactions will be consummated;\n•\nwe would have incurred significant expenses relating to such transactions that we may be unable to recover, including termination fees if applicable; and\n•\nwe may be subject to litigation related to the failure to consummate the transactions or to perform our obligations under the respective transaction agreements.\nIn addition, we entered into the transactions as part of our current growth strategy. Even if the transactions are completed as currently anticipated, there can be no assurances that any anticipated benefits from the transactions will be realized as expected or that such benefits will be achieved within the anticipated time frame or at all. Failure to achieve the anticipated benefits of the transactions could adversely affect our results of operations or cash flows, cause dilution to our earnings per share, decrease or delay any accretive effect of such transactions and negatively impact the price of our common stock.\nThe potential litigation instituted against us, our transaction counterparties, or our respective directors challenging the proposed VICI Transaction may prevent such transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all.\nPotential litigation related to the VICI Transaction may result in injunctive or other relief prohibiting, delaying or otherwise adversely affecting the parties’ ability to complete the VICI Transaction. One of the conditions to the\n19\nVICI Transaction under the master transaction agreement is that no temporary restraining order, preliminary or permanent injunction or other judgment, order or decree issued by any governmental authority of competent jurisdiction prohibiting consummation of the VICI Transaction or any other transactions contemplated by the master transaction agreement shall be in effect. Accordingly, any such injunctive or other relief may prevent the VICI Transaction from becoming effective within the expected timeframe or at all. In addition, defending against such claims may be expensive and divert management’s attention and resources, which could adversely affect our business and the businesses of the counterparties to such transactions.\nRisks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions\nThe global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.\nAs of the date of this annual report, there continues to be uncertainty around the COVID-19 pandemic, its duration, and its impact on U.S. and global economic activity and consumer behavior. The omicron variant of COVID-19, which appears to be the most transmissible and contagious variant to date, has caused an increase in COVID-19 cases globally. The impact of the omicron variant, or of any other variants that may emerge, cannot be predicted at this time, and could depend on numerous factors, including the availability of vaccines in different parts of the world, vaccination rates among the population, the effectiveness of COVID-19 vaccines against the variants, and the response by governmental bodies to reinstate mandated business closures, orders to “shelter in place,” occupancy limitations, and travel and transportation restrictions. While restrictions have eased throughout 2021, new restrictions to combat the spread of the variants, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses, cancellation of events, including sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs may be put into place in the future. In addition, the spread of new variants, including omicron, has had a material impact on domestic and international travel, which has resulted in reduced demand for hotel rooms, convention space and other casino resorts amenities.\nIn Macau, while all of our properties were open during 2021, several travel and entry restrictions were in place in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China (including the temporary suspension of ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau, the nucleic acid test result certificate and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents, for visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and certain regions in mainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors) which significantly impacted visitation to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. In addition, from time to time during 2021 local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during these states of immediate prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on MGM Grand Paradise's operations and it is uncertain whether further closures, including the closure of MGM Grand Paradise's properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.\nThe extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic and new variants continue to impact our business, results of operations, and financial results, including the duration and magnitude of such effects, will depend on numerous evolving factors that we may not be able to accurately predict or assess, including, but not limited to: the duration and scope of the pandemic (and whether there is a, or multiple, further resurgences in the future); the efficacy of the vaccine against existing and new variants of the COVID-19 virus; the adoption rate of vaccines and the ability to effectively and efficiently distribute vaccines domestically and internationally to allow travel to resume to pre-pandemic levels; the negative impact the pandemic has on global and regional economies and economic activity, including the duration and magnitude of its impact on unemployment rates and consumer discretionary spending; its short and longer-term impact on the demand for travel, transient and group business, and levels of consumer confidence even after travel advisories and restrictions are lifted; our and our business partners' ability to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; actions governments, businesses and individuals take in response to the pandemic (including the rise of variant strains of the virus), such as limiting or banning travel and limiting or banning leisure, casino and entertainment (including sporting events) activities, including the complete or partial closures of our properties; and how quickly economies, travel activity, and demand for gaming, entertainment and leisure activities recovers after the pandemic subsides. We may also face unforeseen liability or be subject to additional obligations as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, including as a result of claims alleging exposure to COVID-19 in connection with our operations or facilities or to the extent we are subject to a governmental enforcement action as a result of health and safety compliance. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic may also have the effect of exacerbating many of the other risks described in this section or in any other filings with the SEC. As a result of the foregoing, we cannot predict the ultimate scope, duration and impact the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our results of operations, but it may continue to have a material impact on our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations (including revenues and profitability) and stock price.\n20\nWe face significant competition with respect to destination travel locations generally and with respect to our peers in the industries in which we compete, including increased competition through online sports betting and iGaming, and failure to compete effectively could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows\n.\nThe hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming industries are highly competitive. We do not believe that our competition is limited to a particular geographic area, and hotel, resort, entertainment, and gaming operations in other states or countries, as well as the increased availability of online sports betting and iGaming, could attract our customers. To the extent that new casinos enter our markets or hotel room capacity is expanded by others in major destination locations, competition will increase. Major competitors, including potential new entrants, may also expand their hotel room capacity, expand their range of amenities, improve their level of service, or construct new resorts in Las Vegas, Macau or in the domestic regional markets in which we operate, all of which could attract our customers. Also, the growth of retail gaming in areas outside Las Vegas has increased the competition faced by our operations in Las Vegas and elsewhere. For instance, local referendums were recently passed to allow retail gaming in Virginia and Nebraska, with active lobbying occurring in additional states. While we believe our principal competitors are major gaming and hospitality resorts with well-established and recognized brands, we also compete against smaller hotel offerings and peer-to-peer inventory sources, which allow travelers to book short-term rentals of homes and apartments from owners. We expect that we will continue to face increased competition from new channels of distribution, innovations in consumer-facing technology platforms and other transformations in the travel industry that could impact our ability to attract and retain customers and related business.\nWe have also seen significant expansion across the United States in legalized forms of iGaming and online sports betting and expect additional jurisdictions will likely legalize iGaming and online sports betting in the future. We participate in the domestic iGaming and online sports betting market through our venture, BetMGM, which faces significant competition from other industry participants as well as the broader gaming and entertainment industries. If BetMGM is unable to sustain or grow interest in its offerings it may not be able to gain the scale necessary to successfully compete in the growing market and, as a result, we may not receive the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, the expansion of iGaming, online sports betting, and other types of gaming may further compete with our land-based operations by reducing customer visitation and spend at our properties.\nIn addition, competition could increase if changes in gaming restrictions in the United States and elsewhere are enacted, including the addition of new gaming establishments located closer to our customers than our casinos. For example, while our Macau operations compete to some extent with casinos located elsewhere in or near Asia, certain areas in the region have legalized casino gaming (including Japan) and others (such as Taiwan and Thailand) may legalize casino gaming (or iGaming) in the future. Furthermore, currently MGM Grand Paradise holds one of only six gaming concessions authorized by the Macau government to operate casinos in Macau. If the Macau government were to allow additional competitors to operate in Macau through the grant of additional concessions or if current concessionaires and subconcessionaires open additional facilities, we would face increased competition. Similarly, as a result of Macau’s Gaming Inspection and Co-ordination Bureau increasing scrutiny and restrictions imposed on gaming promoters, we along with certain other casino operators in Macau, suspended our primary gaming promoters, which has led to substantial declines in revenues from gaming promoters. As a result, we expect competition for the mass market segment amongst Macau operators will grow and if we are unable to maintain and further develop our mass market business and replace revenue previously obtained through use of gaming promoters, our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected.\nMost jurisdictions where casino gaming is currently permitted place numerical and/or geographical limitations on the issuance of new gaming licenses. Although a number of jurisdictions in the United States and foreign countries are considering legalizing or expanding casino gaming, in some cases new gaming operations may be restricted to specific locations and we expect that there will be intense competition for any attractive new opportunities (which may include acquisitions of existing properties) that do arise.\nIn addition to competition with other hotels, resorts and casinos, we compete with destination travel locations outside of the markets in which we operate. Our failure to compete successfully in our various markets and to continue to attract customers could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOur business is affected by economic and market conditions in the jurisdictions in which we operate and in the locations in which our customers reside\n.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending and corporate spending on conventions, trade shows and business development. Adverse macroeconomic conditions, including inflation, economic contraction, economic uncertainty or the perception by our customers of weak or weakening economic conditions may cause a decline in demand for hotels, casino resorts, trade shows and conventions, and for the type of luxury amenities we offer. In addition, changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences could be driven by factors such as the increased cost of travel, an unstable job market, perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth, outbreaks of contagious diseases or fears of war and acts of terrorism or other\n21\nacts of violence. Consumer preferences also evolve over time due to a variety of factors, including demographic changes, which, for instance, have resulted in recent growth in consumer demand for non-gaming offerings. Our success depends in part on our ability to anticipate the preferences of consumers and timely react to these trends, and any failure to do so may negatively impact our results of operations. In particular, Aria, Bellagio and MGM Grand Las Vegas may be affected by economic conditions in the Far East, and all of our Nevada resorts are affected by economic conditions in the United States, and California in particular. A recession, economic slowdown or any other significant economic condition, including inflationary pressures, affecting consumers, corporations, or the supply chain, generally is likely to cause a reduction in visitation to our resorts, which would adversely affect our operating results. In addition, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, our business has also been impacted by labor shortages and global supply chain disruptions. If we are unable to hire and retain sufficient employees to operate our properties or procure necessary supplies, our business, results of operations and reputation could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, since we expect a significant number of customers to come to MGM Macau and MGM Cotai (and, to a lesser extent, our domestic properties) from mainland China, general economic, regulatory, geopolitical and market conditions in China could impact our financial prospects. Any slowdown in economic growth or changes to China’s current restrictions on travel and currency conversion or movements, including continued market impacts from the COVID-19 outbreak and market impacts resulting from China’s anti-corruption campaign and related tightening of liquidity provided by non-bank lending entities and cross-border currency monitoring (including increased restrictions on Union Pay withdrawals and other ATM limits on the withdrawal of patacas and facial recognition technology on ATM machines in Macau to strictly enforce the \"know your customer\" regulations for mainland Chinese bank cardholders), could disrupt the number of visitors from mainland China and/or the amounts they are willing to spend at our properties. It is unclear whether these and other measures will continue to be in effect, become more restrictive, or be readopted in the future. These developments have had, and any future policy developments that may be implemented may have, the effect of reducing the number of visitors to Macau from mainland China, which could adversely impact tourism and the gaming industry in Macau.\nFurthermore, our operations in Macau may be impacted by competition for limited labor resources and our ability to retain and hire employees. We compete with a large number of casino resorts for a limited number of employees and we anticipate that such competition will grow in light of the opening of new developments in Macau. While we seek employees from outside of Macau to adequately staff our resorts, certain Macau government policies limit our ability to import labor in certain job classifications (for instance, the Macau government requires that we only hire Macau residents as dealers in our casinos) and any future government policies that freeze or cancel our ability to import labor could cause labor costs to increase (including limitations on our ability to import labor as a result of temporary travel restrictions adopted as part of the COVID-19 mitigation efforts). Finally, because additional casino projects have commenced operations and other projects are under construction, the existing transportation infrastructure may need to be expanded to accommodate increased visitation to Macau. If transportation facilities to and from Macau are inadequate to meet the demands of an increased volume of gaming customers visiting Macau, the desirability of Macau as a gaming destination, as well as the results of operations at our developments in Macau, could be negatively impacted.\nWe may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of our cost savings initiatives, including those associated with our MGM 2020 Plan.\nAs part of our MGM 2020 Plan, we undertook several initiatives to reduce costs and further position us for growth by the end of 2020. In addition, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we implemented several additional cost savings initiatives in 2020 to improve our operating model. However, we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully implement these cost savings initiatives in the time frames contemplated or at all, that we will ultimately be able to realize the expected benefits of these or any other cost savings initiatives, or that any new additional costs or increases in existing expenses will not offset any cost savings. If we fail to achieve the anticipated benefits of any current or future cost savings initiatives, our profitability and results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nOur ability to pay ongoing regular dividends to our stockholders is subject to the discretion of our board of directors and may be limited by our holding company structure, existing and future debt agreements entered into by us or our subsidiaries and state law requirements.\nDuring the COVID-19 pandemic we significantly reduced our historic dividend rate. Although we intend to pay ongoing regular quarterly cash dividends on our common stock; our board of directors may, in its sole discretion, change the amount or frequency of dividends or discontinue the payment of dividends entirely. In addition, our ability to pay dividends is restricted by certain covenants in our credit agreement, and because we are a holding company with no material direct operations, we are dependent on receiving cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Our subsidiaries ability to generate the cash flow necessary to maintain quarterly dividend payments on our common stock is subject to their operating results, cash requirements and financial condition. In addition, our subsidiaries’ ability to make distributions to us is subject to any applicable provisions of state law that may limit the amount of funds available to us, and compliance with covenants and financial ratios related to existing or future agreements governing any indebtedness at such subsidiaries and any limitations in other agreements such subsidiaries may have with third parties. In addition, each of the companies in our\n22\ncorporate chain must manage its assets, liabilities and working capital in order to meet all of their respective cash obligations. As a consequence of these various limitations and restrictions, future dividend payments may be further reduced or eliminated in their entirety. Any change in the level of our dividends or the suspension of the payment thereof could adversely affect the market price of our common stock.\nAll of our domestic gaming facilities are leased and could experience risks associated with leased property, including risks relating to lease termination, lease extensions, charges and our relationship with the lessor, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial position or results of operations.\nAll of our domestic properties are subject to triple-net leases that, in addition to rent, require us to pay: (1) all facility maintenance, (2) all insurance required in connection with the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties, (3) taxes levied on or with respect to the leased properties (other than taxes on the income of the lessor), (4) all capital expenditures, and (5) all utilities and other services necessary or appropriate for the leased properties and the business conducted on the leased properties. We are responsible for paying these expenses notwithstanding the fact that many of the benefits received in exchange for such costs shall accrue in part to the landlords as the owners of the associated facilities. Furthermore, our obligation to pay rent as well as the other costs described above is absolute in virtually all circumstances, regardless of the performance of the properties and other circumstances that might abate rent in leases that now place these risks on the tenant, such as certain events of casualty and condemnation. Finally, our leases limit our ability to cease operations at our properties, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nPaul Salem, our Chairman, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, and Corey Sanders, and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, may have actual or potential conflicts of interest because of their positions at MGP\n.\nPaul Salem serves as our Chairman and as the Chairman of MGP. In addition, Daniel J. Taylor, one of our directors, is also a director of MGP, and Corey Sanders and John M. McManus, members of our senior management, are also directors of MGP. While we have procedures in place to address such situations and the organizational documents with respect to MGP contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties (including fiduciary duties) to any MGP shareholder to the fullest extent permitted by law, these overlapping positions could nonetheless create, or appear to create, potential conflicts of interest when our or MGP’s management and directors pursue the same corporate opportunities, such as potential acquisition targets, or face decisions that could have different implications for us and MGP. Further, potential conflicts of interest could arise in connection with the resolution of any dispute between us and MGP (or its subsidiaries) regarding the terms of the agreements governing the separation and the relationship, between us and MGP, such as under the master lease. Potential conflicts of interest could also arise if we and MGP enter into any commercial or other adverse arrangements with each other in the future.\nDespite our ability to exercise control over the affairs of MGP as a result of our ownership of the single outstanding Class B share of MGP, MGP has adopted a policy under which certain transactions with us, including transactions involving consideration in excess of $25 million, must be approved in accordance with certain specified procedures, which could affect our ability to execute our operational and strategic objectives.\nWe own the single outstanding Class B share of MGP. The Class B Share is a non-economic interest in MGP which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP, and which represents a majority of the voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the holder of the Class B share and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below 30%. We, therefore, have the ability to exercise significant control over MGP’s affairs, including control over the outcome of all matters submitted to MGP’s shareholders for approval.\nMGP’s operating agreement, however, provides that whenever a potential conflict of interest exists or arises between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand, any resolution or course of action by MGP’s board of directors in respect of such conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed to be fair and reasonable to MGP if it is (i) approved by a majority of a conflicts committee which consists solely of “independent” directors (which MGP refers to as “Special Approval”) (such independence determined in accordance with the NYSE’s listing standards, the standards established by the Exchange Act to serve on an audit committee of a board of directors and certain additional independence requirements in our operating agreement), (ii) determined by MGP’s board of directors to be fair and reasonable to MGP or (iii) approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates). Furthermore, MGP’s operating agreement provides that any transaction with a value, individually or in the aggregate, over $25 million between us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries), on the one hand, and MGP or any of its subsidiaries, on the other hand (any such transaction (other than the exercise of rights by us or any of our affiliates (other than MGP and its subsidiaries) under any of the material agreements entered into on the closing day of MGP’s formation transactions), a “Threshold Transaction”), shall be permitted only if (i) Special Approval is obtained or (ii) such transaction is approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of at least a majority of the voting power of MGP’s outstanding voting shares (excluding voting shares owned by us and our affiliates).\nAs a result, certain transactions, including any Threshold Transactions that we may want to pursue with MGP and that could have significant benefit to us may require Special Approval. There can be no assurance that the required approval will be\n23\nobtained with respect to these transactions either from a conflicts committee comprised of independent MGP directors or the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares not held by us and our affiliates. The failure to obtain such requisite consent could materially affect our ability and the cost to execute our operational and strategic objectives.\nBecause a significant number of our major gaming resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, we are subject to greater risks than a gaming company that is more geographically diversified\n.\nGiven that a significant number of our major resorts are concentrated on the Las Vegas Strip, our business may be significantly affected by risks common to the Las Vegas tourism industry. For example, the cost and availability of air services and the impact of any events that disrupt air travel to and from Las Vegas can adversely affect our business. We cannot control the number or frequency of flights to or from Las Vegas, but we rely on air traffic for a significant portion of our visitors. Reductions in flights by major airlines as a result of higher fuel prices or lower demand, as a result of limitations on travel imposed to address the COVID-19 pandemic or otherwise, can impact the number of visitors to our resorts. Additionally, there is one principal interstate highway between Las Vegas and Southern California, where a large number of our customers reside. Capacity constraints of that highway or any other traffic disruptions may also affect the number of customers who visit our facilities.\nWe extend credit to a large portion of our customers and we may not be able to collect gaming receivables\n.\nWe conduct a portion of our gaming activities on a credit basis through the issuance of markers which are unsecured instruments. Table games players typically are issued more markers than slot players, and high-end players typically are issued more markers than patrons who tend to wager lower amounts. High-end gaming is more volatile than other forms of gaming, and variances in win-loss results attributable to high-end gaming may have a significant positive or negative impact on cash flow and earnings in a particular quarter. Furthermore, the loss or a reduction in the play of the most significant of these high-end customers could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We issue markers to those customers whose level of play and financial resources warrant, in the opinion of management, an extension of credit. Uncollectible receivables from high-end customers could have a significant impact on our results of operations.\nWhile gaming debts evidenced by markers and judgments on gaming debts are enforceable under the current laws of Nevada, and Nevada judgments on gaming debts are enforceable in all states under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution, other jurisdictions may determine that enforcement of gaming debts is against public policy. Although courts of some foreign nations will enforce gaming debts directly and the assets in the U.S. of foreign debtors may be reached to satisfy a judgment, judgments on gaming debts from United States courts are not binding on the courts of many foreign nations.\nFurthermore, we expect that MGM China will be able to enforce its gaming debts only in a limited number of jurisdictions, including Macau. To the extent MGM China gaming customers are from other jurisdictions, MGM China may not have access to a forum in which it will be able to collect all of its gaming receivables because, among other reasons, courts of many jurisdictions do not enforce gaming debts and MGM China may encounter forums that will refuse to enforce such debts. Moreover, under applicable law, MGM China remains obligated to pay taxes on uncollectible winnings from customers.\nEven where gaming debts are enforceable, they may not be collectible. Our inability to collect gaming debts could have a significant negative impact on our operating results.\nWe may incur impairments to goodwill, indefinite-lived intangible assets, or long-lived assets which could negatively affect our future profits\n.\nWe review our goodwill, intangible assets and long-lived assets on an annual basis and during interim reporting periods in accordance with the authoritative guidance. Significant negative trends, reduced estimates of future cash flows, disruptions to our business, slower growth rates or lack of growth have resulted in write-downs and impairment charges in the past and, if one or more of such events occurs in the future, additional impairment charges or write-downs may be required in future periods. If we are required to record additional impairment charges or write-downs, this could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations.\nLeisure and business travel\n,\nespecially travel by air\n,\nare particularly susceptible to global geopolitical events\n,\nsuch as terrorist attacks, other acts of violence or acts of war or hostility or the outbreak of infectious diseases\n.\nWe are dependent on the willingness of our customers to travel by air. Since most of our customers travel by air to our Las Vegas and Macau properties, any terrorist act or other acts of violence, outbreak of hostilities, escalation of war, or any actual or perceived threat to the security of travel by air, could adversely affect our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the outbreak of infectious diseases, such as COVID-19, has severely disrupted, and is expected to continue to disrupt, domestic and international travel. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending, and businesses and individuals implementing, restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread, such as restrictions and bans on travel or transportation, stay-at-home directives, limitations on the size of gatherings, closures of work facilities, schools, public buildings and businesses,\n24\ncancellation of events,\nincluding sporting events, concerts, conferences and meetings, and quarantines and lock-downs.  Even when those restrictions are removed, consumer willingness to attend large scale conferences may be impacted for the foreseeable future due to continued concerns over safety and social distancing. See “—The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.”\nFurthermore, although we have been able to purchase some insurance coverage for certain types of terrorist acts, insurance coverage against physical loss or business interruption resulting from war and some forms of terrorism continues to be unavailable.\nCo-investing in properties or businesses, including our investment in BetMGM, decreases our ability to manage risk\n.\nIn addition to acquiring or developing hotels and resorts or acquiring companies that complement our business directly, we have from time to time invested, and expect to continue to invest, in properties or businesses as a co-investor. Co-investors often have shared control over the operation of the property or business. Therefore, the operation of such properties or businesses is subject to inherent risk due to the shared nature of the enterprise and the need to reach agreements on material matters. In addition, investments with other investors may involve risks such as the possibility that the co-investor might become bankrupt or not have the financial resources to meet its obligations, or have economic or business interests or goals that are inconsistent with our business interests or goals, or be in a position to take action contrary to our instructions or requests or contrary to our policies or objectives. Consequently, actions by a co-investor might subject the properties or businesses owned by such entities to additional risk. Further, we may be unable to take action without the approval of our co-investors, or our co-investors could take actions binding on the property without our consent. Additionally, should a co-investor become bankrupt, we could become liable for its share of liabilities.\nFor example, we share control of BetMGM with Entain with all major operating, investing and financial activities requiring the consent of both members. Disagreements between us and Entain could arise in the future, including with respect to the amount and timing of capital contributions. If we and Entain are unable to support the future funding of BetMGM, then BetMGM may not have the resources to execute on the development or implementation of its strategies, including funding efforts to increase its market share, which could result in us not receiving the anticipated benefits from our investment. In addition, if we are awarded a concession to develop an integrated casino resort in Japan, we would do so in a consortium with ORIX and other local investors. As a result, we could be subject to additional risks related to being unable to directly control development activities or the timing of development completion, which may impact our ability to complete the project on our anticipated timeline, or at all, or within the agreed upon specifications.\nAny of our future construction, development or expansion projects will be subject to significant development and construction risks, which could have a material adverse impact on related project timetables, costs and our ability to complete the projects\n.\nAlthough our business model is primarily asset-light, we intend to continue to evaluate opportunities for future construction, development or expansion projects. Any of our future construction, development or expansion projects, such as our proposed integrated resort in Japan, will be subject to a number of risks, including:\n•\nlack of sufficient, or delays in the availability of, financing;\n•\nchanges to plans and specifications;\n•\nengineering problems, including defective plans and specifications;\n•\nshortages of, and price increases in, energy, materials and skilled and unskilled labor;\n•\npricing inflation, including wage inflation, in key supply markets;\n•\ndelays in obtaining or inability to obtain necessary permits, licenses and approvals;\n•\nchanges in laws and regulations, or in the interpretation and enforcement of laws and regulations, applicable to gaming, leisure, residential, real estate development or construction projects;\n•\nlabor disputes or work stoppages;\n•\navailability of qualified contractors and subcontractors;\n•\ndisputes with and defaults by contractors and subcontractors;\n•\npersonal injuries to workers and other persons;\n•\nenvironmental, health and safety issues, including site accidents and the spread of viruses;\n•\nweather interferences or delays;\n•\nfires, typhoons and other natural disasters;\n•\ngeological, construction, excavation, regulatory and equipment problems; and\n•\nother unanticipated circumstances or cost increases.\nThe occurrence of any of these development and construction risks could increase the total costs, delay or prevent the construction, development, expansion or opening or otherwise affect the design and features of any future projects\n25\nwhich we might undertake. In addition, the regulatory approvals associated with our development projects may require us to open future casino resorts by a certain specified time and to the extent we are unable to meet those deadlines, and any such deadlines are not extended, we may lose our regulatory approval to open a casino resort in a proposed jurisdiction, or incur payment penalties in connection with any delays which could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe also make significant capital expenditures to maintain and upgrade our resorts, which may disrupt operations and displace revenue at the properties, including revenue lost while rooms, restaurants and meeting spaces are under renovation and out of service.\nOur insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer. In addition, our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future\n.\nAlthough we have “all risk” property insurance coverage for our operating properties, which covers damage caused by a casualty loss (such as fire, natural disasters, or terrorism or other acts of violence), each policy has certain exclusions. In addition, our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss. Our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty. In addition, certain casualty events, such as labor strikes, nuclear events, acts of war, loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism or other acts of violence, loss of electrical power due to catastrophic events, rolling blackouts or otherwise, deterioration or corrosion, insect or animal damage, and pollution, may not be covered at all under our policies. Therefore, certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses.\nIn addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss, we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed. While we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance, this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event. Furthermore, the leases we entered into in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction and the Bellagio sale-leaseback transaction require us to maintain specified insurance coverage. We cannot assure you that we will continue to be able to obtain the types and limits of insurance coverage required by these leases and, to the extent such required insurance coverage cannot be obtained at commercially reasonable cost or at all, then we would need to obtain amendments to the leases or face a default by the applicable tenant under the lease, which could have material adverse effect on our business.\nWe renew our insurance policies on an annual basis. The cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits, further increase our deductibles or self-insured retentions, or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage.\nAny failure to protect our trademarks could have a negative impact on the value of our brand names and adversely affect our business\n.\nThe development of intellectual property is part of our overall business strategy, and we regard our intellectual property to be an important element of our success. While our business as a whole is not substantially dependent on any one trademark or combination of several of our trademarks or other intellectual property, we seek to establish and maintain our proprietary rights in our business operations through the use of trademarks. We file applications for, and obtain trademarks in, the United States and in foreign countries where we believe filing for such protection is appropriate. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights, parties may infringe our trademarks and our rights may be invalidated or unenforceable. The laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to as great an extent as the laws of the United States. Monitoring the unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. Litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others. Litigation of this type could result in substantial costs and diversion of resource. We cannot assure you that all of the steps we have taken to protect our trademarks in the United States and foreign countries will be adequate to prevent imitation of our trademarks by others. The unauthorized use or reproduction of our trademarks could diminish the value of our brand and its market acceptance, competitive advantages or goodwill, which could adversely affect our business.\nA significant portion of our labor force is covered by collective bargaining agreements.\nWork stoppages and other labor problems could negatively affect our business and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, approximately 35,000 of our employees are covered by collective bargaining agreements. A prolonged dispute with the covered employees or any labor unrest, strikes or other business interruptions in connection with labor negotiations or others could have an adverse impact on our operations, and adverse publicity in the marketplace related to union messaging could further harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services. Also, wage and/or benefit increases resulting from new labor agreements may be significant and could also have an adverse impact on our results of operations. To the extent that our non-union employees seek union representation or elect union representation, we would have exposure to risks associated with representation proceedings, labor negotiations and/or economic impacts of newly negotiated labor agreements. Furthermore, we may have, or acquire in the future, multi-employer plans that are classified as “endangered,”\n26\n“seriously endangered,” or “critical” status. For instance, Borgata’s most significant plan is the Legacy Plan of the UNITE HERE Retirement Fund, which has been listed in “critical status” and is subject to a rehabilitation plan. Plans in these classifications must adopt measures to improve their funded status through a funding improvement or rehabilitation plan, which may require additional contributions from employers (which may take the form of a surcharge on benefit contributions) and/or modifications to retiree benefits. In addition, while Borgata has no current intention to withdraw from these plans, a withdrawal in the future could result in the incurrence of a contingent liability that would be payable in an amount and at such time (or over a period of time) that would vary based on a number of factors at the time of (and after) withdrawal. Any such additional costs may be significant.\nOur business is particularly sensitive to energy prices and a rise in energy prices could harm our operating results\n.\nWe are a large consumer of electricity and other energy and, therefore, higher energy prices may have an adverse effect on our results of operations. Accordingly, increases in energy costs may have a negative impact on our operating results. Additionally, higher electricity and gasoline prices that affect our customers may result in reduced visitation to our resorts and a reduction in our revenues.\nWe may seek to expand through investments in other businesses and properties or through alliances or acquisitions, and we may also seek to divest some of our properties and other assets, any of which may be unsuccessful\n.\nWe intend to consider strategic and complementary acquisitions and investments in other businesses, properties or other assets. Furthermore, we may pursue any of these opportunities in alliance with third parties, including MGP. Acquisitions and investments in businesses, properties or assets, as well as these alliances, are subject to risks that could affect our business, including risks related to:\n•\nspending cash and incurring debt;\n•\nassuming contingent liabilities;\n•\nunanticipated issues in integrating information, communications and other systems;\n•\nunanticipated incompatibility of purchasing, logistics, marketing and administration methods;\n•\nretaining key employees; and\n•\nconsolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be able to identify opportunities or complete transactions on commercially reasonable terms or at all. In addition, even if we are able to identify any such opportunities and complete transactions, we cannot assure you that we will realize the anticipated synergies and benefits of our acquisitions or that they will be accretive to our results of operations. Our estimates and assumptions regarding expected synergies and benefits of our acquisitions could materially change, including as a result of factors beyond our control, and could delay, decrease or eliminate the expected accretive effect of the acquisitions. In addition, even if we are able to successfully integrate new assets and businesses, the integration of such assets and businesses may result in unanticipated costs, competitive responses, loss of customer or other business relationships and the diversion of management attention, and the expansion of our operations in general, whether through acquisition, development or internal growth, could also cause us to incur substantial costs, including legal, professional and consulting fees.\nIn addition, we periodically review our business to identify properties or other assets that we believe either are non-core, no longer complement our business, are in markets which may not benefit us as much as other markets or could be sold at significant premiums. From time to time, we may attempt to sell these identified properties and assets. There can be no assurance, however, that we will be able to complete dispositions on commercially reasonable terms or at all.\nThe failure to maintain the integrity of our computer systems and customer information could result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits and restrictions on our use of data.\nWe collect and process information relating to our employees, guests, and others for various business purposes, including marketing and promotional purposes. The collection and use of personal data are governed by privacy laws and regulations enacted by the various states, the United States and other jurisdictions around the world. Privacy laws and regulations continue to evolve and on occasion may be inconsistent (or conflict) between jurisdictions. Various federal, state and foreign legislative or regulatory bodies may enact or adopt new or additional laws and regulations concerning privacy, data retention, data transfer, and data protection. For example, the European Union has adopted a data protection regulation known as the General Data Protection Regulation, which became fully enforceable in May 2018, that includes operational and compliance requirements with significant penalties for non-compliance. California has enacted a comprehensive privacy law, known as the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which went into effect on January 1, 2020 and provides some of the strongest privacy requirements in the United States. In addition, new privacy requirements in California, Colorado, and Virginia generally go into effect on January 1, 2023.\nCompliance with applicable privacy laws and regulations may increase our operating costs and/or adversely impact our ability to market our products, properties and services to our guests. In addition, non-compliance with applicable\n27\nprivacy laws and regulations by us (or in some circumstances non-compliance by third parties engaged by us), including accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure, unapproved dissemination or a breach of security on systems storing our data may result in damage to our reputation and/or subject us to fines, payment of damages, lawsuits or restrictions on our use or transfer of data. We rely on proprietary and commercially available systems, software, and tools to provide security for processing of customer and employee information, such as payment card and other confidential or proprietary information. Our data security measures are reviewed and evaluated regularly; however, they might not protect us against increasingly sophisticated and aggressive threats including, but not limited to, computer malware, viruses, hacking and phishing attacks by third parties. In addition, while we maintain cyber risk insurance to assist in the cost of recovery from a significant cyber event, such coverage may not be sufficient\n.\nWe also rely extensively on computer systems to process transactions, maintain information and manage our businesses. Disruptions in the availability of our computer systems, through cyber-attacks or otherwise, could impact our ability to service our customers and adversely affect our sales and the results of operations. For instance, there has been an increase in criminal cyber security attacks against companies where customer and company information has been compromised and company data has been destroyed. Our information systems and data, including those we maintain with our third-party service providers, have been subject to cyber security breaches in the past and may be subject to cyber security breaches in the future. In addition, our third-party information system service providers face risks relating to cyber security similar to ours, and we do not directly control any of such parties’ information security operations. A significant theft, loss or fraudulent use of customer or company data maintained by us or by a third-party service provider could have an adverse effect on our reputation, cause a material disruption to our operations, and result in remediation expenses, regulatory penalties and litigation by customers and other parties whose information was subject to such attacks, all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks related to corporate social responsibility and reputation.\nMany factors influence our reputation and the value of our brands including the perception held by our customers, business partners, other key stakeholders and the communities in which we do business. Our business faces increasing scrutiny related to environmental, social and governance factors and risk of damage to our reputation and the value of our brands if we fail to act responsibly in several areas including diversity and inclusion, community engagement and philanthropy, environmental sustainability, plastic pollution, climate change, responsible gaming, supply chain management, workplace conduct, human rights, and many others, some of which may be unforeseen. Any harm to our reputation could further impact employee engagement and retention and the willingness of customers and our partners to do business with us, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and cash flows.\nWe are subject to risks and costs related to climate change.\nExtreme weather conditions, potentially exacerbated by climate change, may cause property damage or interrupt business, which could harm our business and results of operations. Certain of our properties are located in areas that may be subject to extreme weather conditions, including, but not limited to, hurricanes, floods, tornados, wildfires, and winter storms in the United States and severe typhoons in Macau. Such extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations or the operations of critical suppliers, damage our properties, and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in such areas. In addition, our operations or the operations of critical suppliers could be adversely impacted by a drought or other cause of water stress or shortage. A severe drought of extensive duration experienced in Las Vegas or in the other regions in which we operate or source critical supplies could adversely affect our business. Although we maintain both property and business interruption insurance coverage for certain extreme weather conditions, such coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits, including limitation on the coverage period for business interruption, and we cannot assure you that we will be able to fully insure such losses or fully collect, if at all, on claims resulting from such extreme weather conditions.\nFurthermore, such extreme weather conditions may result in reduced availability or increased price volatility of certain critical supplies, may interrupt or impede access to our affected properties, and may cause visits to our affected properties to decrease for an indefinite period. Additionally, many states and municipalities have begun to adopt laws and policies on climate change and emission reduction targets. Changes in federal, state, and local legislation and regulation based on concerns about climate change could result in increased regulatory costs, which may include capital expenditures on our existing properties to ensure compliance with any new or updated regulations, which may potentially adversely affect our operations. There can be no assurance that the potential impacts of climate change and severe weather will not have a material adverse effect on our properties, operations or business.\n28\nRisks Related to Legal and Regulatory Matters and Changes in Public Policy\nOur businesses are subject to extensive regulation and the cost of compliance or failure to comply with such regulations may adversely affect our business and results of operations\n.\nOur ownership and operation of gaming facilities is subject to extensive regulation by the countries, states and provinces in which we operate. These laws, regulations and ordinances vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but generally concern the responsibility, financial stability and character of the owners and managers of gaming operations as well as persons financially interested or involved in gaming operations. As such, our gaming regulators can require us to disassociate ourselves from suppliers or business partners found unsuitable by the regulators or, alternatively, cease operations in that jurisdiction. In addition, unsuitable activity on our part or on the part of our domestic or foreign unconsolidated affiliates or subsidiaries in any jurisdiction could have a negative effect on our ability to continue operating in other jurisdictions. The regulatory environment in any particular jurisdiction may change in the future and any such change could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. Furthermore, our iGaming and online sports betting initiatives may be particularly subject to risks related to potential changes in the regulatory environment as a result of the continued development of regulations in this industry. For example, in 2018, the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”) reversed its previously-issued opinion published in 2011, which stated that interstate transmissions of wire communications that do not relate to a “sporting event or contest” fall outside the purview of the Wire Act of 1961 (“Wire Act”). The DOJ’s updated opinion concluded instead that the Wire Act was not uniformly limited to gaming relating to sporting events or contests and that certain of its provisions apply to non-sports-related wagering activity. In June 2019, a federal district court in New Hampshire ruled that the DOJ’s new interpretation of the Wire Act was erroneous and vacated DOJ’s new opinion. The DOJ appealed the decision of the district court to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. In January 2021, the Court of Appeals essentially affirmed the decision of the district court, and the DOJ did not file a further appeal. For a summary of gaming and other regulations that affect our business, see “Regulation and Licensing” and Exhibit 99.1 to this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nFurther, our directors, officers, key employees and investors in our properties must meet approval standards of certain state and foreign regulatory authorities. If state regulatory authorities were to find such a person or investor unsuitable, we would be required to sever our relationship with that person or the investor may be required to dispose of his, her or its interest in the property. State regulatory agencies may conduct investigations into the conduct or associations of our directors, officers, key employees or investors to ensure compliance with applicable standards. Certain public and private issuances of securities, borrowings under credit agreements, guarantees of indebtedness and other transactions also require the approval of certain regulatory authorities.\nMacau laws and regulations concerning gaming and gaming concessions are complex, and a court or administrative or regulatory body may in the future render an interpretation of these laws and regulations, or issue new or modified regulations, that differ from MGM China’s interpretation, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, financial condition and results of operations. In addition, MGM Grand Paradise's activities in Macau are subject to administrative review and approval by various government agencies. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to obtain all necessary approvals, and any such failure to do so may materially affect its long-term business strategy and operations. Macau laws permit redress to the courts with respect to administrative actions; however, to date such redress is largely untested in relation to gaming issues.\nIn addition to gaming regulations, we are also subject to various federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations affecting businesses in general. These laws and regulations include, but are not limited to, restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages, environmental matters, smoking, employees, currency transactions, taxation, zoning and building codes, and marketing and advertising. For instance, we are subject to certain federal, state and local environmental laws, regulations and ordinances, including the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, the Resource Conservation Recovery Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act, the Energy Policy Act, the Safe Drinking Water Act, Renewable Portfolio Standards, the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, and many others. Under various federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations, an owner or operator of real property may be held liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances or wastes located on its property, regardless of whether or not the present owner or operator knows of, or is responsible for, the presence of such substances or wastes. Such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. In addition, effective January 1, 2019, smoking in casinos in Macau, including MGM Macau and MGM Cotai, is only permitted inside specially ventilated smoking rooms, rather than outside smoking areas or VIP areas. The likelihood or outcome of similar legislation in other jurisdictions and referendums in the future cannot be predicted, though any smoking ban would be expected to negatively impact our financial performance.\nWe also deal with significant amounts of cash in our operations and are subject to recordkeeping and reporting obligations as required by various anti-money laundering laws and regulations. For instance, we are subject to regulation under the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act of 1970, commonly known as the “Bank Secrecy Act”, which, among other things, requires us to report to the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) any currency transactions in excess of $10,000 that occur within a 24-hour gaming day, including identification of the individual(s) involved in the currency\n29\ntransaction. We are also required to report certain suspicious activity where we know, suspect or have reason to suspect transactions, among other things, involve funds from illegal activity or are intended to evade federal regulations or avoid reporting requirements or have no business or lawful purpose. In addition, under the Bank Secrecy Act we are subject to various other rules and regulations involving reporting, recordkeeping and retention. Our compliance with the Bank Secrecy Act is subject to periodic examinations by the IRS. Any such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future, or new laws and regulations could be enacted. Any violations of the anti-money laundering laws, including the Bank Secrecy Act, or regulations by any of our properties could have an adverse effect on our financial condition, results of operations or cash flows.\nFurthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in governments, public institutions and other organizations imposing or recommending restrictions on various activities or other actions to combat its spread. See “—The global COVID-19 pandemic has continued to materially impact our business, financial results and liquidity, and such impact could worsen and last for an unknown period of time.” In addition to the pandemic-related restrictions that resulted in the temporary closures of our properties during 2020, governmental or other COVID-19-related restrictions have been extended or reimposed from time-to-time and new restrictions may be imposed in the future.\nAny violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act or any other similar anti-corruption laws could have a negative impact on us\n.\nHistorically, a significant portion of our revenue was derived from operations outside the United States, which exposes us to complex foreign and U.S. regulations inherent in doing cross-border business and in each of the countries in which we transact business. We are subject to compliance with the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other similar anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign government officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. While our employees and agents are required to comply with these laws, we cannot be sure that our internal policies and procedures will always protect us from violations of these laws, despite our commitment to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws by us or our non-controlled ventures may result in severe criminal and civil sanctions as well as other penalties against us, and the SEC and U.S. Department of Justice continue to vigorously pursue enforcement of the FCPA. The occurrence or allegation of these types of risks may adversely affect our business, performance, prospects, value, financial condition, and results of operations.\nIf the jurisdictions in which we operate increase gaming taxes and fees, as well as other taxes and fees, our results could be adversely affected\n.\nState and local authorities raise a significant amount of revenue through taxes and fees, including taxes and fees on gaming activities. From time to time, legislators and government officials have proposed changes in tax laws, or in the administration of such laws, affecting the gaming industry. Periods of economic downturn or uncertainty and budget deficits may intensify such efforts to raise revenues through increases in gaming or other taxes, the imposition of new taxes or changes to tax laws that result in increased taxes to us. If the jurisdictions in which we operate were to increase taxes, impose new taxes or change existing tax laws, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe future recognition of our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset is uncertain, and the amount of valuation allowance we may apply against such deferred tax asset may change materially in future periods.\nWe currently have significant deferred tax assets resulting from foreign tax credit carryforwards that are available to reduce taxes attributable to potential taxable foreign-sourced income in future periods, including the recapture of overall domestic losses to the extent of 50 percent of U.S. taxable income per year. We evaluate our foreign tax credit deferred tax asset for recoverability and record a valuation allowance to the extent that we determine it is not more likely than not such asset will be recovered. This evaluation is based on all available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to our assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.\nWe face risks related to pending claims that have been\n,\nor future claims that may be\n,\nbrought against us\n.\nClaims have been brought against us and our subsidiaries in various legal proceedings, and additional legal and tax claims arise from time to time. We may not be successful in the defense or prosecution of our current or future legal proceedings, which could result in settlements or damages that could significantly impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and reputation. Please see the further discussion in “Legal Proceedings” and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.\nRisks Related to Our Macau Operations\nWe have agreed not to have any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China\n.\nAs a result of the extension of the Macau gaming subconcession, we entered into a First Renewed Deed of Non-Compete Undertakings with MGM China and Ms. Ho, Pansy Catilina Chiu King (“Ms.\n30\nHo”), pursuant to which we are restricted from having any interest or involvement in gaming businesses in the People’s Republic of China, Macau, Hong Kong and Taiwan, other than through MGM China. While gaming is currently prohibited in China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, if it is legalized in the future our ability to compete in these locations could be limited until the earliest of (i) the date MGM China’s ordinary shares cease to be listed on The Stock Exchange of Hong Kong Limited or (ii) the last day of MGM Grand Paradise's subconcession for operation of casino games (or any extension thereof); or (iii) the date when our ownership of MGM China shares is less than 20% of the then-issued share capital of MGM China.\nThe Macau government can terminate MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession under certain circumstances without compensating MGM Grand Paradise\n,\nexercise its redemption right with respect to the subconcession, or refuse to grant MGM Grand Paradise an extension of the subconcession in 2022\n,\nor MGM Grand Paradise may be unsuccessful in obtaining a gaming concession when a new public tender is held by the Macau government, any of which would have a material adverse effect on our business\n,\nfinancial condition\n,\nresults of operations and cash flows\n.\nThe Macau government has the right to unilaterally terminate the subconcession in the event of fundamental non-compliance by MGM Grand Paradise with applicable Macau laws or MGM Grand Paradise’s basic obligations under the subconcession contract. MGM Grand Paradise has the opportunity to remedy any such non-compliance with its fundamental obligations under the subconcession contract within a period to be stipulated by the Macau government. Upon such termination, all of MGM Grand Paradise’s casino area premises and gaming-related equipment would be transferred automatically to the Macau government without compensation to MGM Grand Paradise, and we would cease to generate any revenues from these operations. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will perform all of its obligations under the subconcession contract in a way that satisfies the requirements of the Macau government.\nFurthermore, under the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise is obligated to comply with any laws and regulations that the Macau government might promulgate in the future. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to comply with these laws and regulations or that these laws and regulations would not adversely affect our ability to construct or operate our Macau businesses. If any disagreement arises between MGM Grand Paradise and the Macau government regarding the interpretation of, or MGM Grand Paradise’s compliance with, a provision of the subconcession contract, MGM Grand Paradise will be relying on a consultation and negotiation process with the Macau government. During any consultation or negotiation, MGM Grand Paradise will be obligated to comply with the terms of the subconcession contract as interpreted by the Macau government. Currently, there is no precedent concerning how the Macau government will treat the termination of a concession or subconcession upon the occurrence of any of the circumstances mentioned above. The loss of the subconcession would require us to cease conducting gaming operations in Macau, which would have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, the subconcession contract expires on June 26, 2022. Pursuant to the current Macau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill, the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years, under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions, which is on June 26, 2022, but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended, or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended, the casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM Grand Paradise will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and an event of default under MGM China’s revolving credit facilities. Beginning on April 20, 2017, the Macau government may redeem the subconcession contract by providing us at least 1 year prior notice. In the event the Macau government exercises this redemption right, MGM Grand Paradise is entitled to fair compensation or indemnity. The amount of such compensation or indemnity will be determined based on the amount of gaming and non-gaming revenue generated by MGM Grand Paradise, excluding the convention and exhibition facilities, during the taxable year prior to the redemption, before deducting interest, depreciation and amortization, multiplied by the number of remaining years before expiration of the subconcession. We cannot assure you that MGM Grand Paradise will be able to obtain an extension of the subconcession contract or be awarded a new gaming concession on terms favorable to MGM Grand Paradise or at all. In\n31\naddition, there is uncertainty on the terms associated with any extension, which could include additional fees or other financial commitments that may have an adverse impact on the financial position of MGM Grand Paradise. We also cannot assure you that if the subconcession is redeemed, the compensation paid to MGM Grand Paradise will be adequate to compensate for the loss of future revenues.\nWe are subject to risks associated with doing business outside of the United States\n.\nOur operations outside of the United States are subject to risks that are inherent in conducting business under non-United States laws, regulations and customs. In particular, the risks associated with the operation of MGM China or any future operations in which we may engage in any other foreign territories, include:\n•\nchanges in laws and policies that govern operations of companies in Macau or other foreign jurisdictions;\n•\nchanges in non-United States government programs;\n•\npossible failure by our employees or agents to comply with anti-bribery laws such as the United States Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar anti-bribery laws in other jurisdictions;\n•\ngeneral economic conditions and policies in China, including restrictions on travel and currency movements;\n•\ndifficulty in establishing, staffing and managing non-United States operations;\n•\ndifferent labor regulations;\n•\nchanges in environmental, health and safety laws;\n•\noutbreaks of diseases or epidemics, including the COVID-19 pandemic;\n•\npotentially negative consequences from changes in or interpretations of tax laws;\n•\npolitical instability and actual or anticipated military and political conflicts;\n•\neconomic instability and inflation, recession or interest rate fluctuations; and\n•\nuncertainties regarding judicial systems and procedures.\nThese risks, individually or in the aggregate, could have an adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows. We are also exposed to a variety of market risks, including the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates. If the United States dollar strengthens in relation to the currencies of other countries, our United States dollar reported income from sources where revenue is denominated in the currencies of other such countries will decrease.\nConflicts of interest may arise because certain of our directors and officers are also directors of MGM China\n,\nthe holding company for MGM Grand Paradise which owns and operates MGM Macau and MGM Cotai\n.\nAs a result of the initial public offering of shares of MGM China common stock in 2011, MGM China has stockholders who are not affiliated with us, and we and certain of our officers and directors who also serve as officers and/or directors of MGM China may have conflicting fiduciary obligations to our stockholders and to the minority stockholders of MGM China. Decisions that could have different implications for us and MGM China, including contractual arrangements that we have entered into or may in the future enter into with MGM China, may give rise to the appearance of a potential conflict of interest or an actual conflict of interest."

In the second quarter of 2020 the Company reduced its annual dividend to $0.01 per share in light of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on its operations at that time. The Company has maintained an annual dividend of $0.01 per share throughout 2021. The amount, declaration and payment of any future dividends will be subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors who will evaluate our dividend policy from time to time based on factors it deems relevant, and the contractual limitations described below. In addition, as a holding company with no independent operations, our ability to pay dividends will depend upon the receipt of cash from our operating subsidiaries to generate the funds from operations necessary to pay dividends on our common stock. Furthermore, our senior credit facility contains financial covenants and restrictive covenants that could restrict our ability to pay dividends, subject to certain exceptions. In addition, the Operating Partnership and MGM China credit facilities each contain limitations on the ability of the applicable subsidiary under each credit agreement to pay dividends to us. There can be no assurance that we will continue to pay dividends in the future.\nPurchases of Equity Securities by the Issuer\nThe following table provides information about share repurchases made by the Company of its common stock during the quarter ended December 31, 2021:\nIn February 2020, upon substantial completion of the May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, the Company’s Board of Directors authorized a $3.0 billion stock repurchase program. Under the stock repurchase program, the Company may repurchase shares from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated agreements. Repurchases of common stock may also be made under a Rule 10b5-1 plan, which would permit common stock to be purchased when the Company might otherwise be precluded from doing so under insider trading laws. The timing, volume and nature of stock repurchases will be at the sole discretion of management, dependent on market conditions, applicable securities laws, and other factors, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time. All shares repurchased by the Company during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 were purchased pursuant to the Company’s publicly announced stock repurchase programs and have been retired.\n35\nPERFORMANCE GRAPH\nThe graph below matches our cumulative 5-year total shareholder return on common stock with the cumulative total returns of the Dow Jones US Total Return index, the S&P 500 index and the Dow Jones US Gambling index.

    "text": "This management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations includes discussion as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. Discussion of our financial condition and results of operations as of and for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to December 31, 2019 can be found in our Annual Report on Form 10-K\nfor the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) on February 26, 2021.\nDescription of our business and key performance indicators\nOur primary business is the operation of casino resorts, which offer gaming, hotel, convention, dining, entertainment, retail and other resort amenities. We operate several of the finest casino resorts in the world and we continually reinvest in our resorts to maintain our competitive advantage. Most of our revenue is cash-based, through customers wagering with cash or paying for non-gaming services with cash or credit cards. We rely on the ability of our resorts to generate operating cash flow to fund capital expenditures, provide excess cash flow for future development, repay debt financings, and return capital to our shareholders. We make significant investments in our resorts through newly remodeled hotel rooms, restaurants, entertainment and nightlife offerings, as well as other new features and amenities.\nOur results of operations are affected by decisions we make related to our capital allocation, our access to capital and our cost of capital. While we continue to be focused on improving our financial position and returning capital to shareholders, we are also dedicated to capitalizing on strategic development or initiatives.\nOur results of operations do not tend to be seasonal in nature, though a variety of factors may affect the results of any interim period, including the timing of major conventions, Far East baccarat volumes, the amount and timing of marketing and special events for our high-end gaming customers, and the level of play during major holidays, including New Year and Lunar New Year. While our results do not depend on key individual customers, a significant portion of our operating income is generated from high-end gaming customers, which can cause variability in our results. In addition, our success in marketing to customer groups such as convention customers and the financial health of customer segments such as business travelers or high-end gaming customers from a specific country or region can affect our results.\nFinancial Impact of COVID-19\nThe spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter. In March 2020, all of our domestic properties were temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all of our properties that were temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for certain of our properties or portions thereof into the first quarter of 2021. Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, with restrictions varying by jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, our domestic jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies.\nAlthough all of our properties have re-opened, in light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions and/or temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, we cannot predict whether jurisdictions, states or the federal government will adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future than in the past, including stay-at-home orders or the temporary closure of all or a portion of our properties as a result of the pandemic.\nIn Macau, following a temporary closure of our properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars, temperature checks, and mask protection. Although the issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visit scheme) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province and all other provinces in mainland China to travel to Macau resumed on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September 23, 2020, respectively, several travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remain in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau, the negative nucleic acid test result certificate, and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents, for visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and\n37\nmainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors), which significantly impacted visitation to our Macau properties. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances, certain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during these states of immediate prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on our operations and it is uncertain whether further closures, including the closure of our properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.\nThe Las Vegas Strip segment results of operations are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Las Vegas visitor volume increased 69% compared to the prior year period according to information published by the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority. The Las Vegas market has had the addition of new sporting events and venues, the expansion of convention centers, as well as music and entertainment events, which have positively impacted visitation, along with the easing of COVID-19 related restrictions, as discussed above.\nThe MGM China segment results of operations also are heavily impacted by visitor volume and trends. During the year ended December 31, 2021, Macau visitor arrivals increased 31% compared to the prior year period according to statistics published by the Statistics and Census Service of the Macau Government, as the prior year period was more negatively affected by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year period.\nFor a discussion of the risks to our business resulting from COVID-19, please see “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Business, Industry, and Market Conditions.”\nOther Developments\nAs of December 31, 2021, we lease the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a master lease agreement with MGP. See Note 1 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding MGP and the Operating Partnership, which we consolidate in our financial statements. All intercompany transactions, including transactions under the master lease with MGP, have been eliminated in consolidation.\nAs further discussed below, we lease the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement with Bellagio BREIT Venture, the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas pursuant to a lease agreement with MGP BREIT Venture, and the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuant to a lease agreement with a fund managed by Blackstone, as further discussed below.\nIn April 2019, we acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (“Northfield”), an Ohio limited liability company that owned the real estate assets and operations of the Hard Rock Rocksino Northfield Park,  from MGP and MGP retained the real estate assets. We then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, and added it to the master lease between us and MGP. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this acquisition.\nAlso, in January 2019, we acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City in Yonkers, New York for consideration of approximately $865 million. Subsequently, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from us and Empire City was added to the master lease between us and MGP. In addition, pursuant to the master lease amendment, we agreed to provide MGP a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent that we develop additional gaming facilities and choose to sell or transfer such property in the future. See Note 4 and Note 18 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this acquisition.\nIn March 2019, we entered into an amendment to the master lease between us and MGP with respect to improvements made by us related to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. See Note 18 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this transaction with MGP, which is eliminated in consolidation.\nIn November 2019, we completed the Bellagio transaction, pursuant to which Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from us and entered into a lease agreement to lease the real estate assets back to us. The Bellagio lease has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual rent of $245 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 10 years\n38\nand, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3% during the 11th through 20th years and 4% thereafter. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the property on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding 2-year period. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, we received total consideration of $4.25 billion, which consisted of a 5% equity interest in the venture and cash of approximately $4.2 billion. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of Bellagio BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). As a result of the sale, we recorded a gain of approximately $2.7 billion. See Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfall guarantee, respectively.\nIn December 2019, we sold Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land for $825 million, which consisted of $663 million paid in cash and a secured note due 2024 with a face value of $163 million and fair value of $134 million. In connection with our review of the carrying value of assets to be sold due to the offer for sale received during the third quarter of 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge of $219 million. Upon completion of the sale in the fourth quarter, we recorded a loss of $2 million. See Note 1 and Note 16 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.\nIn February 2020, we completed the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to MGP BREIT Venture, owned 50.1% by the Operating Partnership and 49.9% by a subsidiary of BREIT. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, MGM and MGP received total consideration of $4.6 billion, which was comprised of $2.5 billion of cash, $1.3 billion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s 50.1% equity interest in MGP BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately 3 million Operating Partnership units to us representing 5% of the equity value of MGP BREIT Venture. We also provide a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately 5 million MGP Class A shares for $150 million.\nSee Note 1, Note 11, and Note 12 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, lease agreement, and shortfall guarantee, respectively.\nIn connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with us for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas. The lease has an initial term of 30 years with two 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual rent of $292 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding 1-year period. See Note 11 in the accompanying financial statements for information regarding this lease agreement.\nIn connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $133 million, as further discussed in Note 18.\nAlso, in\nJanuary 2020, we, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to us in connection with us exercising our right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem the Operating Partnership units we hold, at a price per unit equal to a 3% discount to the\nten day average closing price prior to the date of the notice of redemption\n. The waiver was\neffective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and\nwas scheduled to terminate on the earlier of February 14, 2022 or upon our receipt of cash proceeds of $1.4 billion as consideration for the redemption of our Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020 the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 30 million Operating Partnership units that we held for $700 million, or $23.10 per unit, and on December 2, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately 24 million Operating Partnership units that we held for the remaining $700 million, or $29.78 per unit. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.\nIn March 2021, we delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately 37 million Operating Partnership units that we held which was satisfied with aggregate cash proceeds of approximately $1.2 billion, using cash on hand together with the proceeds from MGP's issuance of Class A shares. See Note 13 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.\n39\nIn August 2021, we entered into an agreement with VICI and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP. Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive 1.366 shares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and we will receive 1.366 units of the new VICI OP in exchange for each Operating Partnership unit we hold. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $43 per share of MGP Class A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the majority of our VICI OP units for cash consideration of $4.4 billion, with us retaining an approximate $370 million ownership interest in the VICI OP (based upon the close price of VICI stock as of August 3, 2021). MGP’s Class B share that we hold will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, we will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The new master lease will have an initial term of 25 years, with three 10-year renewals, and initial annual rent of $860 million, escalating annually at a rate of 2% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of 3%. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021). See “Item 1A. Risk Factors — Risks Related to Our Announced Transactions — The VICI Transaction, The Cosmopolitan transaction, and The Mirage transaction each remain subject to the satisfaction of certain closing conditions, including the receipt of certain regulatory approvals, and any anticipated benefits from such transactions may take longer to realize than expected or may not be realized at all.”\nIn September 2021, we entered into an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, subject to customary working capital adjustments. Additionally, we will enter into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan lease will have an initial term of 30 years with three subsequent 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual cash rent of $200 million with a fixed 2% escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. Additionally, the lease will require us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues over a rolling 5-year period at the property on capital expenditures and for us to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding 1-year period. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nIn September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World for cash consideration of $2.125 billion. Upon the closing of the transaction, we own 100% of CityCenter and accordingly no longer account for our interest under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements. See Note 4 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this transaction.\nIn September 2021, we sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) for cash consideration of $3.89 billion and entered into a lease pursuant to which we lease back the real property.\nThe lease has an initial term of 30 years with three 10-year renewal periods, exercisable at our option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual rent of $215 million with a fixed 2% escalator  for the first 15 years and, thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of 2% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of 3%. In addition, the lease obligates us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues at the properties on capital expenditures and that we comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require us to maintain cash security or provide a letter of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to the rent for the succeeding 1-year period.\nSee Note 11 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding this lease.\nIn October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from us and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master lease between us and MGP through which we lease back the real property.\nTransactions with MGP, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in our consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.\nIn December 2021, we entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Hard Rock for cash consideration of $1.075 billion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Pursuant to the agreement, Hard Rock is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing has not occurred on or before December 13, 2022, which date may be extended by either party to March 13, 2023 under certain circumstances. The agreement contemplates a reverse termination fee of $322.5 million that is payable by Hard Rock to us in the event that the parties are unable to obtain antitrust or gaming regulatory approval. Upon closing, the master lease between us and VICI (or MGP in the event that the VICI Transaction is terminated) will be amended and restated to reflect a $90 million reduction in annual cash rent. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or termination of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals.\n40\nKey Performance Indicators\nKey performance indicators related to gaming and hotel revenue are:\n•\nGaming revenue indicators: table games drop and slots handle (volume indicators); “win” or “hold” percentage, which is not fully controllable by us. Our normal table games hold percentage at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts is in the range of 25.0% to 35.0% of table games drop for Baccarat and 19.0% to 23.0% for non-Baccarat; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in our hold percentages; and\n•\nHotel revenue indicators: hotel occupancy (a volume indicator); average daily rate (“ADR,” a price indicator); and revenue per available room (“REVPAR,” a summary measure of hotel results, combining ADR and occupancy rate). Our calculation of ADR, which is the average price of occupied rooms per day, includes the impact of complimentary rooms. Complimentary room rates are determined based on standalone selling price. Because the mix of rooms provided on a complimentary basis, particularly to casino customers, includes a disproportionate suite component, the composite ADR including complimentary rooms is slightly higher than the ADR for cash rooms, reflecting the higher retail value of suites. Rooms that were out of service during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 as a result of closures due to the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.\nAdditional key performance indicators at MGM China are:\n•\nGaming revenue indicators: MGM China utilizes “turnover,” which is the sum of nonnegotiable chip wagers won by MGM China calculated as nonnegotiable chips purchased plus nonnegotiable chips exchanged less nonnegotiable chips returned. Turnover provides a basis for measuring VIP casino win percentage. Win for VIP gaming operations at MGM China is typically in the range of 2.6% to 3.3% of turnover; however, reduced gaming volumes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic could cause volatility in MGM China’s hold percentages.\nResults of Operations\nThe following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nSummary Operating Results\nThe following table summarizes our operating results:\n41\nOur domestic properties were temporarily closed due to COVID-19 on the dates shown below:\nConsolidated net revenues were $9.7 billion in 2021 compared to $5.2 billion in 2020, an  increase of 88%. The current year benefited from the inclusion of the net revenues of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021 and the removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions at our properties, as well as an increase in travel, while the prior year was negatively affected by temporary property closures at certain of our Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Regional Operations for a portion of the year due to the pandemic. At MGM China, the prior year was negatively affected by both property closures in the first quarter and was also more significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year. These factors resulted in a 111% increase in net revenues at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, a 72% increase in net revenues at our Regional Operations, and an 84% increase in net revenues at MGM China.\nConsolidated operating income was $2.3 billion for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to a loss of $642 million in 2020, due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year as well as the inclusion of the operating income of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021, as discussed above. The current year included a gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net of $1.6 billion and the prior year included a $1.5 billion gain on REIT transactions, net and $26 million in restructuring costs. In addition, corporate expense decreased $37 million compared to the prior year. Corporate expense in the current year included $34 million in transaction costs, while the prior year included $44 million of CEO transition expense and $49 million of October 1 litigation settlement expense. Included in the CEO transition expense is $20 million of stock compensation expense, of which approximately $13 million related to the modification and accelerated vesting of outstanding stock compensation awards. Property transactions, net in the current year included a gain of $29 million related to a reduction in the estimate of contingent consideration related to the Empire City acquisition, a gain of $76 million relating to the sale of art, and an other-than-temporary impairment charge of $22 million related to an investment in an unconsolidated affiliate. Property transactions, net in the prior year included a $64 million other-than-temporary non-cash impairment charge on an equity method investment and $17 million related to a loss on production show costs. Depreciation expense decreased $60 million compared to the prior year primarily as a result of certain assets\n42\nbecoming fully depreciated in the current year at MGM China, primarily at MGM Cotai. General and administrative expense increased $385 million compared to the prior year due primarily to the prior year reflecting the temporary property closures, the inclusion of rent expense for the Aria lease, which commenced in September 2021, and also due to a full period of rent expense for the MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay lease in the current year, partially offset by realized benefits from our cost savings initiatives at our domestic properties.\nNet Revenues by Segment\nThe following table presents a detail by segment of net revenues:\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts casino revenue was $1.5 billion in 2021, compared to $728 million in 2020, an increase of 113%, due primarily to the temporary property closures for a portion of 2020 and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions, as well as an increase in travel in the current year, and the inclusion of the operating results of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021.\n43\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts rooms revenue was $1.4 billion in 2021, compared to $663 million in 2020, an increase of 112%, due primarily to the temporary property closures for a portion of the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions, as well as an increase in travel in the current year, and the inclusion of the operating results of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021.\nThe following table shows key hotel statistics for our Las Vegas Strip Resorts:\n(1)\nRooms that were out of service, including full and midweek closures, during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic were excluded from the available room count when calculating hotel occupancy and REVPAR.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts food and beverage revenue was $1.0 billion in 2021, compared to $472 million in 2020, an increase of 115%, due primarily to the temporary closures at certain properties and operational and capacity restrictions in the prior year and removal of those restrictions in the current year as well as an increase in travel in the current year, and the inclusion of the operating results of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021. However, not all outlets were fully re-opened during the current year and the properties did not benefit from the removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions as well as an increase in travel primarily until the latter part of the second quarter of the current year.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts entertainment, retail and other revenue was $770 million in 2021, compared to $383 million in 2020, an increase of 101%, due primarily to the temporary property closures for a portion of the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions as well as an increase in travel in the current year, and the inclusion of the operating results of Aria subsequent to consolidation in September 2021. However, venue re-openings and events did not primarily occur until beginning in the latter part of the second quarter of the current year.\nRegional Operations\nRegional Operations casino revenue was $2.7 billion in 2021, compared to $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 73%, due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions and, to a lesser extent, increase in travel in the current year.\n44\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for our Regional Operations:\nRegional Operations rooms revenue was $221 million in 2021, compared to $131 million in 2020, an increase of 69%, due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions and, to a lesser extent, increase in travel in the current year.\nRegional Operations food and beverage revenue was $308 million in 2021, compared to $184 million in 2020, an increase of 67%, due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions beginning primarily in the second quarter of the current year.\nRegional Operations entertainment, retail and other revenue was $142 million in 2021, compared to $83 million in 2020, an increase of 72%, due primarily to temporary property closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions beginning primarily in the second quarter of the current year.\nMGM China\nThe following table shows key gaming statistics for MGM China:\nMGM China net revenues were $1.2 billion in 2021, compared to $657 million in 2020, an increase of 84%. The prior year was negatively affected by both property closures in February 2020 and was more significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau than in the current year.\nCorporate and other\nCorporate and other revenue includes revenues from other corporate operations, management services and reimbursed costs revenue primarily related to our CityCenter management agreement (which was terminated upon the acquisition of CityCenter in September 2021). Reimbursed costs revenue represents reimbursement of costs, primarily payroll-related, incurred by us in connection with the provision of management services and was $226 million, $245 million and $437 million for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Reimbursed costs revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 decreased compared to the prior year due primarily to the termination of the CityCenter management agreement as discussed above. See below for additional discussion of our share of operating results from unconsolidated affiliates.\n45\nAdjusted Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR\nThe following table presents Adjusted Property EBITDAR and Adjusted EBITDAR. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is our reportable segment generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments. See Note 17 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and “Reportable Segment GAAP measure” below for additional information.\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts\nLas Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $1.7 billion in 2021 compared to $232 million in 2020. Las Vegas Strip Resorts Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin increased to 36.7% in 2021 compared to 10.3% in 2020. The current year benefited from the increase in revenues, as discussed above, as well as realized benefits from our cost savings initiatives.\nRegional Operations\nRegional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $1.2 billion in 2021 compared to $344 million in 2020. Regional Operations Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin increased to 35.9% in 2021 compared to 17.5% in 2020 as the current year benefited from the increase in revenues, as discussed above, as well as realized benefits from our cost saving initiatives.\nMGM China\nMGM China’s Adjusted Property EBITDAR was $25 million in 2021 compared to a loss of $194 million in 2020. The increase was due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year as well as the prior year being more significantly impacted by travel and entry restrictions in Macau and other operational restrictions related to the pandemic than in the current year. License fee expense was $21 million for 2021 and $11 million in the prior year.\nOperating Results – Details of Certain Charges\nProperty transactions, net consisted of the following:\nSee Note 16 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of property transactions, net.\n46\nOperating Results – Income from Unconsolidated Affiliates\nThe following table summarizes information related to our share of operating income from unconsolidated affiliates:\nIn September 2021, we completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter held by Infinity World and now own 100% of the equity interest in CityCenter. Accordingly, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, and we now consolidate CityCenter in our financial statements.\nIn June 2021, CityCenter closed the sale of its Harmon land for $80 million on which it recorded a $30 million gain. We recorded a $50 million gain, which included $15 million of our 50% share of the gain recorded by CityCenter and $35 million representing the reversal of certain basis differences in 2021.\nOur share of CityCenter’s operating income, including certain basis difference adjustments, was $128 million for the current year period through September 26, 2021 compared to our share of CityCenter's operating loss of $30 million in 2020, due primarily to the temporary property closures in the prior year and removal of mandated operational and capacity restrictions, an increase in travel beginning primarily in the second quarter of the current year, and the gain related to the sale of its Harmon land in the current year, as discussed above, partially offset by a shorter comparative period in the current year given that, as of September 2021, we no longer account for our interest in CityCenter under the equity method of accounting, as discussed above.\nNon-operating Results\nInterest expense.\nThe following table summarizes information related to interest expense, net:\nGross interest expense was $800 million in 2021 compared to $679 million in 2020. The increase in gross interest expense was due primarily to an increase in average debt outstanding related to senior notes due to the issuances by us,  the Operating Partnership and MGM China in 2020 and 2021, partially offset by a decrease in the weighted average interest rate of the senior notes. See Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on long-term debt and see “Liquidity and Capital Resources” for additional discussion on issuances and repayments of long-term debt and other sources and uses of cash.\nOther, net.\nOther income, net was $66 million in 2021 compared to other expense, net of $89 million in 2020. The current year included a\n$28 million\nnet gain on change in fair value of an equity instrument, a $39 million gain on the Operating Partnership’s unhedged interest rate swaps, and $22 million of interest income, partially offset by $13 million of foreign currency remeasurement losses primarily related to MGM China’s U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes. The prior year included a $109 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to our senior notes and the termination of our revolving facility, as well as an $18 million loss incurred on the early retirement of debt related to the Operating Partnership’s repayment of its term loan A facility and its term loan B facility, partially offset by $9 million of foreign currency remeasurement gains primarily related to MGM China’s U.S. dollar-denominated senior notes, and $32 million in interest income.\n47\nIncome taxes.\nThe following table summarizes information related to our income taxes:\nOur effective rate for 2021 was favorably impacted by the permanent exclusion of a portion of the gain on consolidation of CityCenter partially offset by the unfavorable impact of losses in Macau that we could not benefit. The effective rate for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by losses in Macau that we could not benefit and adjustments to valuation allowances for Macau deferred tax assets and foreign tax credits, partially offset by tax benefit resulting from carrying back net operating losses to tax years with a higher tax rate than is currently in effect.\nCash taxes paid increased in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to an increase in federal income taxes paid resulting from increased U.S. taxable income following the recovery of the business from the impacts of COVID-19.\nReportable Segment GAAP measure\n“Adjusted Property EBITDAR” is our reportable segment GAAP measure, which we utilize as the primary profit measure for our reportable segments and underlying operating segments. Adjusted Property EBITDAR is a measure defined as earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, gain on REIT transactions, net, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense associated with triple-net operating and ground leases, income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures, property transactions, net, and also excludes gain on consolidation  of CityCenter, net, gain related to CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates and corporate expense (which includes CEO transition expense and October 1 litigation settlement) and stock compensation expense, which are not allocated to each operating segment, and rent expense related to the master lease with MGP that eliminates in consolidation. We manage capital allocation, tax planning, stock compensation, and financing decisions at the corporate level. “Adjusted Property EBITDAR margin” is Adjusted Property EBITDAR divided by related segment net revenues.\nNon-GAAP Measure\n“Adjusted EBITDAR” is earnings before interest and other non-operating income (expense), taxes, depreciation and amortization, preopening and start-up expenses, property transactions, net, gain on REIT transactions, net, gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net, CEO transition expense, October 1 litigation settlement, restructuring costs (which represents costs related to severance, accelerated stock compensation expense, and consulting fees directly related to the operating model component of the MGM 2020 Plan), rent expense associated with triple-net operating and ground leases, gain related to CityCenter's sale of Harmon land recorded within income from unconsolidated affiliates, and income from unconsolidated affiliates related to investments in real estate ventures.\nAdjusted EBITDAR information is a valuation metric, should not be used as an operating metric, and is presented solely as a supplemental disclosure to reported GAAP measures because we believe this measure is widely used by analysts, lenders, financial institutions, and investors as a principal basis for the valuation of gaming companies. We believe that while items excluded from Adjusted EBITDAR may be recurring in nature and should not be disregarded in evaluation of our earnings performance, it is useful to exclude such items when analyzing current results and trends. Also, we believe excluded items may not relate specifically to current trends or be indicative of future results. For example, preopening and start-up expenses will be significantly different in periods when we are developing and constructing a major expansion project and will depend on where the current period lies within the development cycle, as well as the size and scope of the project(s). Property transactions, net includes normal recurring disposals, gains and losses on sales of assets related to specific assets within our resorts, but also includes gains or losses on sales of an entire operating resort or a group of resorts and impairment charges on entire asset groups or investments in unconsolidated affiliates, which may not be comparable period over period. However, as discussed herein, Adjusted EBITDAR should not be viewed as a measure of overall operating performance, considered in isolation, or as an alternative to net income, because this measure is not\n48\npresented on a GAAP basis and exclude certain expenses, including the rent expense associated with our triple-net operating and ground leases, and are provided for the limited purposes discussed herein.\nAdjusted EBITDAR should not be construed as an alternative to operating income or net income, as an indicator of our performance; or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities, as a measure of liquidity; or as any other measure determined in accordance with GAAP. We have significant uses of cash flows, including capital expenditures, interest payments, taxes, real estate triple-net lease and ground lease payments, and debt principal repayments, which are not reflected in Adjusted EBITDAR. Also, other companies in the gaming and hospitality industries that report Adjusted EBITDAR information may calculate Adjusted EBITDAR in a different manner and such differences may be material.\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of net income attributable to MGM Resorts International to Adjusted EBITDAR:\nGuarantor Financial Information\nAs of December 31, 2021, all of our principal debt arrangements are guaranteed by each of our wholly owned material domestic subsidiaries that guarantee our senior credit facility. Our principal debt arrangements are not guaranteed by MGP, the Operating Partnership, MGM Grand Detroit, MGM National Harbor, Blue Tarp reDevelopment, LLC (the entity that operates MGM Springfield), and each of their respective subsidiaries. Our foreign subsidiaries, including MGM China and its subsidiaries, are also not guarantors of our principal debt arrangements. In the event that any subsidiary is no longer a guarantor of our credit facility or any of our future capital markets indebtedness, that subsidiary will be released and relieved of its obligations to guarantee our existing senior notes. The indentures governing the senior notes further provide that in the event of a sale of all or substantially all of the assets of, or capital stock in a subsidiary guarantor then such subsidiary guarantor will be released and relieved of any obligations under its subsidiary guarantee.\n49\nThe guarantees provided by the subsidiary guarantors rank senior in right of payment to any future subordinated debt of ours or such subsidiary guarantors, junior to any secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing such debt and effectively subordinated to any indebtedness and other obligations of our subsidiaries that do not guarantee the senior notes. In addition, the obligations of each subsidiary guarantor under its guarantee is limited so as not to constitute a fraudulent conveyance under applicable law, which may eliminate the subsidiary guarantor’s obligations or reduce such obligations to an amount that effectively makes the subsidiary guarantee lack value.\nThe summarized financial information of us and our guarantor subsidiaries, on a combined basis, is presented below. Certain of our guarantor subsidiaries collectively own Operating Partnership units and each subsidiary accounts for its respective investment under the equity method within the summarized financial information presented below. These subsidiaries have also accounted for the MGP master lease as an operating lease, recording operating lease liabilities and operating ROU assets with the related rent expense of guarantor subsidiaries reflected within the summarized financial information.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash Flows – Summary\nOur cash flows consisted of the following:\n50\nCash Flows\nOperating activities.\nTrends in our operating cash flows tend to follow trends in operating income, excluding non-cash charges, but can be affected by changes in working capital, the timing of significant interest payments, tax payments or refunds, and distributions from unconsolidated affiliates\n. Cash provided by operating activities was $1.4 billion in 2021 compared to cash used in operating activities of $1.5 billion in 2020. The change from the prior year was due primarily to the increase in Adjusted Property EBITDAR discussed within the results of operations section above, and due to the prior year being negatively affected by a change in working capital related to gaming and non-gaming deposits, gaming taxes and other gaming liabilities, and payroll related liabilities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by an increase in triple-net lease rent payments and cash paid for interest and taxes.\nInvesting activities.\nOur investing cash flows can fluctuate significantly from year to year depending on our decisions with respect to strategic capital investments in new or existing resorts, business acquisitions or dispositions, and the timing of maintenance capital expenditures to maintain the quality of our resorts. Capital expenditures related to regular investments in our existing resorts can also vary depending on timing of larger remodel projects related to our public spaces and hotel rooms\n.\nCash provided by investing activities was $1.5 billion in\n2021\ncompared to $2.2 billion in\n2020\n. In 2021, we received $3.9 billion in net cash proceeds from the sale of the real estate of Aria (including Vdara), received $107 million in net proceeds from the sale of property and equipment, primarily related to the sale of art, which were partially offset by our payments of $1.8 billion to acquire CityCenter, net of cash acquired,\n$491 million\nin capital expenditures, as further discussed below, and contributions of $225 million to BetMGM. In comparison, in the prior year we received\n$2.5 billion in net cash proceeds from the Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas real estate transaction, which were partially offset by $271 million in capital expenditures and $80 million in contributions to BetMGM. In the prior year period, distributions from unconsolidated affiliates included $51 million related to our share of a distribution paid by CityCenter.\nCapital Expenditures\nIn 2021, we made capital expenditures of $491 million, of which $68 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $49 million primarily related to construction of the Emerald Tower project at MGM Cotai and $19 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $423 million primarily relate to expenditures in information technology and room remodels.\nIn 2020, we made capital expenditures of $271 million, of which $108 million related to MGM China. Capital expenditures at MGM China included $95 million primarily related to construction close-out and projects at MGM Cotai and $13 million related to projects at MGM Macau. Capital expenditures at our Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and corporate entities of $162 million included expenditures relating to information technology, health and safety initiatives, and various room, restaurant, and entertainment venue remodels.\nFinancing activities.\nCash used in financing activities was $2.8 billion in\n2021\ncompared to cash provided by financing activities of $2.1 billion in 2020. In\n2021\n,\nwe had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, as further discussed below, distributed $324 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and we repurchased $1.8 billion of our common stock, partially offset by net proceeds received of $793 million from the issuance of MGP's Class A shares. In comparison, in the prior year period, we received net proceeds from the incurrence of the bridge loan facility in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction of $1.3 billion, net proceeds of $525 million\nfrom MGP’s Class A share issuances,\nnet debt borrowings of $1.1 billion, as further discussed below, repurchased $354 million of our common stock, distributed $286 million to noncontrolling interest owners, and paid $78 million in dividends to our shareholders\n.\nBorrowings and Repayments of Long-term Debt\nIn 2021, we had net repayments of debt of $1.3 billion, which consisted of the repayment of the $1.7 billion outstanding on CityCenter's credit facility in full, which was assumed in the acquisition, using cash on hand, and net repayments of $407 million on MGM China’s first revolving credit facility. These repayments were partially offset by MGM China’s March 2021 issuance of $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2027 at an issue price of 99.97% and net draws of $40 million on the Operating Partnership's revolving credit facility, of which $35 million was used in connection with MGP's acquisition of MGM Springfield with the remainder used to fund the Operating Partnership's and MGP's distribution and dividend payments. The net proceeds from MGM China’s 4.75% senior notes due 2027 issuance were used to partially repay amounts outstanding under the MGM China first revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\n51\nIn 2020, we had net proceeds from the incurrence of the bridge loan facility in connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction of $1.3 billion and net debt borrowings of $1.1 billion, which consisted of net borrowings on MGM China’s credit facility of $103 million, our issuance of $750 million of 4.75% senior notes and $750 million of 6.75% senior notes, the Operating Partnership’s issuance of $750 million of 3.875% senior notes and $800 million of 4.625% senior notes, and MGM China’s issuance of $500 million of 5.25% senior notes, partially offset by the tender of $750 million of our senior notes and the corresponding $97 million of tender offer costs, and the net repayment of $1.7 billion on the Operating Partnership's senior credit facility consisting of the repayment of $1.3 billion of its term loan B facility in full using the proceeds of the $1.3 billion bridge loan facility, which was then assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, the repayment of its $399 million term loan A facility in full using the net proceeds from MGP’s settlement of forward equity agreements, partially offset by a net draw of $10 million on its revolving credit facility.\nIn March 2020, with certain of the proceeds from the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, we completed cash tender offers for an aggregate amount of $750 million of our senior notes, comprised of $325 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.75% senior notes due 2025, $100 million principal amount of our outstanding 4.625% senior notes due 2026, and $325 million principal amount of our outstanding 5.5% senior notes due 2027.\nIn May 2020, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of\n6.750% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to further increase our liquidity position.\nIn June 2020, the Operating Partnership issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.625% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to repay borrowings on the Operating Partnership’s senior credit facility, which were used to fund the May 2020 redemption of $700 million of Operating Partnership units held by us.\nIn June 2020, MGM China issued $500 million in aggregate principal amount of 5.25% senior notes due 2025. The proceeds were used to partially repay amounts outstanding under the MGM China credit facility and for general corporate purposes.\nIn October 2020, we issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.75% senior notes due 2028.\nThe proceeds were used for general corporate purposes.\nIn November 2020, the Operating Partnership issued $750 million in aggregate principal amount of 3.875% senior notes due 2029. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, which included the December 2020 redemption of $700 million of the Operating Partnership units held by us.\nDividends, Distributions to Noncontrolling Interest Owners and Share Repurchases\nIn 2021, we repurchased and retired $1.8 billion of our common stock pursuant to our May 2018 $2.0 billion and February 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase programs. As a result of those repurchases, we completed our May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program, and the remaining availability under the February 2020 $3.0 billion stock repurchase program was $1.3 billion as of December 31, 2021. In 2020, we repurchased and retired $354 million of our common stock pursuant to our May 2018 $2.0 billion stock repurchase program.\nIn March 2021, June 2021, September 2021, and December 2021, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $5 million for 2021. In March 2020, we paid a dividend of $0.15 per share, and in June 2020, September 2020 and December 2020, we paid dividends of $0.0025 per share, totaling $78 million for 2020.\nIn 2020, MGM China paid the final dividend for 2019 of $41 million, of which we received $23 million and noncontrolling interests received $18 million.\nThe Operating Partnership paid the following distributions to its partnership unit holders during 2021 and 2020:\n•\n$545 million of distributions paid in 2021, of which we received $243 million and MGP receiv\ned $302 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders; and\n•\n$602 million of distributions paid in 2020, of which we received $358 million and MGP received $2\n44 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.\nOther\nFactors Affecting Liquidity and Anticipated Uses of Cash\nAs previously discussed, the spread of COVID-19 and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on our business, financial condition, results of operations, and cash flows\nin 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter\n.\nWe require a certain amount of cash on hand to operate our resorts.\n52\nIn addition to required cash on hand for operations, we utilize corporate cash management procedures to minimize the amount of cash held on hand or in banks. Funds are swept from the accounts at most of our domestic resorts daily into central bank accounts, and excess funds are invested overnight or are used to repay amounts drawn under our revolving credit facility. In addition, from time to time we may use excess funds to repurchase our outstanding debt and equity securities subject to limitations in our revolving credit facility and Delaware law, as applicable. We have significant outstanding debt, interest payments, rent payments, and contractual obligations in addition to planned capital expenditures and commitments, including acquiring the operations of The Cosmopolitan for cash consideration of $1.625 billion, as discussed further in Note 1\n.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had cash and cash equivalents of $4.7 billion, of which MGM China held $399 million and the Operating Partnership held $8 million. In addition to our cash and cash equivalent balance, we have significant holdings: a 41.5% economic interest in MGP (refer to Note 1 for discussion on our agreement entered into in August 2021 regarding the VICI Transaction) and an approximate 56% interest in MGM China.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had $12.9 billion in principal amount of indebtedness, including $360 million outstanding under the $1.25 billion MGM China first revolving credit facility and $50 million outstanding under the $1.35 billion Operating Partnership revolving credit facility. No amounts were drawn on our $1.675 billion revolving credit facility or the $400 million MGM China second revolving credit facility.\nWe have $1.0 billion of debt maturing in the next twelve months, which we expect to repay with cash on hand.\nDue to the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, in February 2021, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to provide for waivers of the maximum leverage ratio and minimum interest coverage ratio through the fourth quarter of 2022. In February 2022, MGM China further amended each of its first revolving credit facility and its second revolving credit facility to extend the financial covenant waivers through maturity.\nAs of December 31, 2021, our expected cash interest payments, excluding MGP and MGM China, for 2022, 2023, and 2024 are approximately $300 million, $225 million, and $190 million, respectively, and our expected cash interest payments on a consolidated basis, which includes MGP if the VICI Transaction does not close and MGM China, for 2022, 2023, and 2024, are approximately $715 million, $625 million, and $585 million, respectively. We are also required as of December 31, 2021 to make annual cash rent payments of $1.6 billion, in the aggregate, under the triple-net lease agreements, which leases are also subject to annual escalators and also require us\nto pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the annual cash rent.\nWe have planned capital expenditures in 2022 of approximately $775 million to $815 million domestically and approximately $110 million to $130 million at MGM China,\nwhich is inclusive of the capital expenditures required under the triple-net lease agreements, each of which requires us to spend a specified percentage of net revenues, at the respective properties, on capital expenditures. We additionally have\nplanned contributions to BetMGM in 2022 of approximately $225 million.\nWe also expect to continue to repurchase shares pursuant to our February 2020 $3.0 billion share repurchase program. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, we repurchased approximately\n15 million\nshares of our common stock at an average price of\n$43.88\nper share for an aggregate amount of\n$670 million\n. Repurchased shares were retired.\nIn January 2022, the Operating Partnership paid $141 million of distributions to its partnership unit holders, of which we received $59 million and MGP received $82 million, which MGP concurrently paid as a dividend to its Class A shareholders.\nOn\nFebruary 9, 2022\n, our Board of Directors approved a quarterly dividend of\n$0.0025\nper share. The dividend will be payable on\nMarch 15, 2022\nto holders of record on\nMarch 10, 2022\n. Future determinations regarding the declaration and payment of dividends, if any, will be at the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on then-existing conditions, including our results of operations, financial condition, and other factors that our Board of Directors may deem relevant\n.\nAs previously discussed, the COVID-19 pandemic has caused, and is continuing to cause, significant economic disruption both globally and in the United States, and impacted our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows i\nn 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact our business in 2022 and thereafter\n. As widespread vaccine distribution continues and operational restrictions have been removed, we have seen economic recovery in some of the market segments in which we operate, as shown in our Summary Operating Results. However, some areas continue to experience renewed outbreaks and surges in infection rates. As a result, our business segments continue to face many uncertainties and our operations remain vulnerable to reversal of these trends or other continuing negative effects caused by\n53\nthe pandemic. We cannot predict the degree, or duration, to which our operations will be affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects could be material. We continue to monitor the evolving situation and guidance from international and domestic authorities, including federal, state and local public health authorities and may take additional actions based on their recommendations. In these circumstances, there may be developments outside our control requiring us to further adjust our operating plan, including the implementation or extension of new or existing restrictions, which may include the reinstatement of stay-at-home orders in the jurisdictions in which we operate or additional restrictions on travel and/or our business operations. Because the situation is ongoing, and because the duration and severity remain unclear, it is difficult to forecast any impacts on our future results.\nFor additional information related to our long-term obligations, refer to the maturities of long-term debt table in Note 9 and the lease liability maturity table in Note 11.\nPrincipal Debt Arrangements\nSee Note 9 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for information regarding our debt agreements as of December 31, 2021.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nManagement’s discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements. To prepare our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, we must make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. We regularly evaluate these estimates and assumptions, particularly in areas we consider to be critical accounting estimates, where the estimates and assumptions involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. However, by their nature, judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty and therefore actual results can differ from our estimates.\nLoss Reserve for Casino Accounts Receivable\nMarker play represents a significant portion of the table games volume at certain of our Las Vegas resorts. Our other casinos do not emphasize marker play to the same extent, although we offer markers to customers at those casinos as well. MGM China extends credit to certain in-house VIP gaming customers and, historically, to gaming promoters. We maintain strict controls over the issuance of markers and aggressively pursue collection from our customers who fail to pay their marker balances timely. These collection efforts are similar to those used by most large corporations when dealing with overdue customer accounts, including the mailing of statements and delinquency notices, personal contacts, the use of outside collection agencies and civil litigation. Markers are generally legally enforceable instruments in the United States and Macau. Markers are not legally enforceable instruments in some foreign countries, but the United States assets of foreign customers may be reached to satisfy judgments entered in the United States. We consider the likelihood and difficulty of enforceability, among other factors, when we issue credit to customers at our domestic resorts who are not residents of the United States. MGM China performs background checks and investigates credit worthiness prior to issuing credit. Refer to Note 2 for further discussion of our casino receivables and those due from customers residing in foreign countries.\nWe maintain a loss reserve for casino accounts at all of our operating casino resorts. The provision for doubtful accounts, an operating expense, increases the loss reserve. We regularly evaluate the loss reserve for casino accounts. At domestic resorts where marker play is not significant, the loss reserve is generally established by applying standard reserve percentages to aged account balances, which is supported by relevant historical analysis and any other known information such as the current economic conditions that could drive losses. At domestic resorts where marker play is significant, we apply standard reserve percentages to aged account balances under a specified dollar amount and specifically analyze the collectability of each account with a balance over the specified dollar amount, based on the age of the account, the customer’s current and expected future financial condition, collection history and current and expected future economic conditions. MGM China specifically analyzes the collectability of casino receivables on an individual basis taking into account the age of the account, the financial condition and the collection history of the customer or, historically, the gaming promoter.\nIn addition to enforceability issues, the collectability of unpaid markers given by foreign customers at our domestic resorts is affected by a number of factors, including changes in currency exchange rates and economic conditions in the customers’ home countries. Because individual customer account balances can be significant, the loss reserve and the provision can change significantly between periods, as information about a certain customer becomes known or as changes in a region’s economy occur.\n54\nThe following table shows key statistics related to our casino receivables, net of discounts:\nApproximately $63 million and $54 million of casino receivables and $31 million and $18 million of the loss reserve for casino accounts receivable relate to MGM China at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable decreased in the current year due to a decrease in specific reserves at our domestic resorts, as well as the i\nnclusion of Aria in the current year, which had a lower loss reserve compared to our other domestic resorts due to the age of its outstanding receivables, partially offset by an increase in the loss reserve at MGM China primarily due to an increase in its specific reserves.\nAt December 31, 2021, a 100 basis-point change in the loss reserve as a percentage of casino accounts receivable would change income before income taxes by $4 million.\nFixed Asset Capitalization and Depreciation Policies\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of our property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and was therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Maintenance and repairs that neither materially add to the value of the property nor appreciably prolong its life are charged to expense as incurred. Depreciation and amortization are provided on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets. When we construct assets, we capitalize direct costs of the project, including fees paid to architects and contractors, property taxes, and certain costs of our design and construction subsidiaries. In addition, interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized as part of the cost of the project. Interest is typically capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of our outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest starts when construction activities begin and ceases when construction is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\nWe must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures. Whether an expenditure is considered a maintenance expense, or a capital asset is a matter of judgment. When constructing or purchasing assets, we must determine whether existing assets are being replaced or otherwise impaired, which also may be a matter of judgment. In addition, our depreciation expense is highly dependent on the assumptions we make about our assets’ estimated useful lives. We determine the estimated useful lives based on our experience with similar assets, engineering studies, and our estimate of the usage of the asset. Whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset, we account for the change prospectively.\nImpairment of Long-lived Assets, Goodwill and Indefinite-lived Intangible Assets\nWe evaluate our property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on our classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets classified as held for sale, we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs of disposal, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, we review for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. We then compare the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment is recorded based on the fair value of the asset. For operating assets, fair value is typically measured using a discounted cash flow model whereby future cash flows are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital, developed using a standard capital asset pricing model, based on guideline companies in our industry. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets to be held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\nThere are several estimates, assumptions and decisions in measuring impairments of long-lived assets. First, management must determine the usage of the asset. To the extent management decides that an asset will be sold, it is more likely that an impairment may be recognized. Assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist. This means that some assets must be grouped, and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets. Future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates.\n55\nOn a quarterly basis, we review our major long-lived assets to determine if events have occurred or circumstances exist that indicate a potential impairment. Potential factors which could trigger an impairment include underperformance compared to historical or projected operating results, negative industry or economic factors, significant changes to our operating environment, or changes in intended use of the asset group. We estimate future cash flows using our internal budgets and probability weight cash flows in certain circumstances to consider alternative outcomes associated with recoverability of the asset group, including potential sale. Historically, undiscounted cash flows of our significant operating asset groups have exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. During 2019, we recorded a non-cash impairment charge relating to the carrying value of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. Refer to Note 16 for further discussion.\nWe review indefinite-lived intangible assets at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. We perform our annual impairment test for indefinite-lived intangible assets in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Indefinite-lived intangible assets consist primarily of license rights and trademarks. For our 2021 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a qualitative (“step zero”) analysis for certain of our indefinite-lived intangibles and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such intangibles exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. We elected to perform a quantitative analysis for the MGM Northfield Park gaming license in 2021 primarily using the discounted cash flow approach, for which the fair value exceeded its carrying value by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If certain future operating results do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of the intangibles to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in an impairment charge.\nWe review goodwill at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2021. For our 2021 annual impairment tests, we utilized the option to perform a step zero analysis for certain of our reporting units and concluded it was more likely than not that the fair values of such reporting units exceeded their carrying values by a substantial margin. As discussed below, management makes significant judgments and estimates as part of these analyses. If future operating results of our reporting units do not meet current expectations it could cause carrying values of our reporting units to exceed their fair values in future periods, potentially resulting in a goodwill impairment charge.\nThere are several estimates inherent in evaluating these assets for impairment. In particular, future cash flow estimates are, by their nature, subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates. In addition, the determination of multiples, capitalization rates and the discount rates used in the impairment tests are highly judgmental and dependent in large part on expectations of future market conditions.\nSee Note 2 and Note 7 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of goodwill and other intangible assets.\nImpairment of Investments in Unconsolidated Affiliates\nSee Note 2 to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our evaluation of other-than-temporary impairment of investments in unconsolidated affiliates. During 2021 and 2020, we recorded $22 million and $64 million, respectively, in other-than-temporary impairment charges on equity method investments. Refer to Note 6 for further discussion. Our investments in unconsolidated affiliates had no material impairments in 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material.\nWe recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and temporary differences with future tax consequences. We reduce the carrying amount of deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. Accordingly, the need to establish valuation allowances for deferred tax assets is assessed at each reporting period based on such \"more-likely-than-not\" realization threshold. This assessment considers, among other matters, the nature, frequency and severity of current and cumulative losses, forecasts of future profitability, the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, the duration of statutory carryforward periods, and tax planning strategies.\nWe recorded a valuation allowance on the net deferred tax assets of our domestic jurisdictions of $2.7 billion as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020, and a valuation allowance on certain net deferred tax assets of foreign jurisdictions of $149 million and $156 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We reassess the realization of deferred tax assets each reporting period. In the event we were to determine that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to\n56\nrealize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future, we would increase the valuation allowance and recognize a corresponding charge to earnings or other comprehensive income in the period in which we make such a determination. Likewise, if we later determine that we are more likely than not to realize the deferred tax assets, we would reverse the applicable portion of the previously recognized valuation allowance. In order for us to realize our deferred tax assets, we must be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the jurisdictions in which the deferred tax assets are located.\nFurthermore, we are subject to routine corporate income tax audits in many of these jurisdictions. We believe that positions taken on our tax returns are fully supported, but tax authorities may challenge these positions, which may not be fully sustained on examination by the relevant tax authorities. Accordingly, our income tax provision includes amounts intended to satisfy assessments that may result from these challenges. Determining the income tax provision for these potential assessments and recording the related effects requires management judgments and estimates. The amounts ultimately paid on resolution of an audit could be materially different from the amounts previously included in our income tax provision and, therefore, could have a material impact on our income tax provision, net income and cash flows.\nRefer to Note 10 in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion relating to income taxes."

    "text": "Market Risk\nIn addition to the inherent risks associated with our normal operations, we are also exposed to additional market risks. Market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. Our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk associated with our variable rate long-term debt. We attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long-term fixed rate borrowings and short-term borrowings under our bank credit facilities and by utilizing interest rate swap agreements that provide for a fixed interest payment on the Operating Partnership’s credit facility. A change in interest rates generally does not have an impact upon our future earnings and cash flow for fixed-rate debt instruments. As fixed-rate debt matures, however, and if additional debt is acquired to fund the debt repayment, future earnings and cash flow may be affected by changes in interest rates. This effect would be realized in the periods subsequent to the periods when the debt matures. We do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes and do not enter into derivative transactions that would be considered speculative positions\n.\nAs of December 31, 2021, variable rate borrowings represented approximately 3% of our total borrowings after giving effect\non the Operating Partnership’s borrowings for the currently effective interest rate swap agreements on which the Operating Partnership pays a weighted average of 1.783% on a total notional amount of $700 million. Additionally, the Operating Partnership has $900 million of notional amount of forward starting swaps that are not currently effective. The following table provides additional information about the maturities of our debt subject to changes in interest rates, excluding the effect of the Operating Partnership interest rate swaps discussed above:\nIn addition to the risk associated with our variable interest rate debt, we are also exposed to risks related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, mainly related to MGM China and to our operations at MGM Macau and MGM Cotai. While recent fluctuations in exchange rates have not been significant, potential changes in policy by governments or fluctuations in the economies of the United States, China, Macau or Hong Kong could cause variability in these exchange rates. We cannot assure you that the Hong Kong dollar will continue to be pegged to the U.S. dollar or the current peg rate for the Hong Kong dollar will remain at the same level. The possible changes to the peg of the Hong Kong dollar may result in severe fluctuations in the exchange rate thereof. For U.S. dollar denominated debt incurred by MGM China, fluctuations in the exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar could have adverse effects on our financial position and results of operations. As of December 31, 2021, a 1% weakening of the Hong Kong dollar (the functional currency of MGM China) to the U.S. dollar would result in a foreign currency transaction loss of $28 million\n.\n57"

All other financial statement schedules have been omitted because they are not applicable, or the required information is included in the consolidated financial statements or the notes thereto.\n58\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of MGM Resorts International\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated financial statements and financial statement schedule as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 25, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Annual Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nFebruary 25, 2022\n59\nREPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM\nTo the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of MGM Resorts International\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of MGM Resorts International and subsidiaries (the \"Company\") as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income (loss), cash flows and stockholders' equity for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule of Valuation and Qualifying Accounts included in Item 15(a)(2), (collectively referred to as the \"financial statements\"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 25, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matter\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition and Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets Valuation of CityCenter — Refer to Notes 1 and 4 to the financial statements\nOn September 27, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the 50% ownership interest in CityCenter Holdings, LLC (“CityCenter”) held by Infinity World Development Corp  for cash consideration of $2.125 billion. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a 50% ownership interest, which was accounted for under the equity method. The Company accounted for the acquisition under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations, and the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date, which included $180.0 million of trademarks and $1.4 billion of goodwill. Management estimated the fair value of the trademarks using the relief from royalty method, which is a specific discounted cash flow method. Goodwill was recognized as the excess of the cash consideration and the acquisition-date fair value of the Company’s equity method investment over the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\nThe fair value determination of the trademarks required management to make significant estimates and assumptions around expected cash flows and projected financial results, including forecasted revenues (collectively the “forecast”), as\n60\nwell as the selection of discount rates. Changes to these assumptions and estimates could have a significant impact on the fair value of the trademarks and the recognition of goodwill. Therefore, auditing the forecast and the selection of discount rates involved a higher degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity, as well as an increased level of audit effort, including the involvement of fair value specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the forecast and selection of discount rates used by management to determine the fair value of the acquired intangible assets and the reporting unit assigned goodwill included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over determining the fair value of the tradename, including those over management’s forecast and the selection of discount rates.\n•\nWe evaluated the assumptions and estimates included in the forecast by:\n◦\nComparing the forecasts to information included in the Company’s communications to the Board of Directors, earnings and press releases, gaming industry reports, investor presentations, and analyst reports for the Company and certain of its peer companies;\n◦\nComparing the forecasts to historical financial results;\n◦\nConducting inquiries with management; and\n◦\nEvaluating whether the forecast was consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n•\nWith the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the reasonableness of the discount rates by:\n◦\nTesting the market-based source information underlying the determination of the discount rates and the mathematical accuracy of the discount rate calculations.\n◦\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nLas Vegas, Nevada\nFebruary 25, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 2002.\n61\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In thousands, except share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n62\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS\n(In thousands, except per share data)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n63\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n64\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\n(In thousands)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements.\n65\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\nFor the Years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019\n(In thousands\n)\nThe accompanying notes are an integral part of these consolidated financial statements\n66\nMGM RESORTS INTERNATIONAL AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1 —\nORGANIZATION\nOrganization.\nMGM Resorts International (together with its consolidated subsidiaries, unless otherwise indicated or unless the context requires otherwise, the “Company”) is a Delaware corporation that acts largely as a holding company and, through subsidiaries, owns and operates casino resorts.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company operates the following integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Las Vegas, Nevada: Aria (including Vdara), Bellagio, MGM Grand Las Vegas (including The Signature), The Mirage, Mandalay Bay, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, and Excalibur. The Company also operates MGM Grand Detroit in Detroit, Michigan, MGM National Harbor in Prince George’s County, Maryland, MGM Springfield in Springfield, Massachusetts, Borgata in Atlantic City, New Jersey, Empire City in Yonkers, New York, MGM Northfield Park in Northfield Park, Ohio, and the following resorts in Mississippi: Beau Rivage in Biloxi and Gold Strike Tunica in Tunica. Additionally, the Company operates The Park, a dining and entertainment district located between New York-New York and Park MGM, and the Company owns and operates Shadow Creek, an exclusive world-class golf course located approximately ten miles north of its Las Vegas Strip Resorts and Fallen Oak golf course in Saucier, Mississippi.\nMGM Growth Properties LLC (“MGP”), a consolidated subsidiary of the Company, is organized as an umbrella partnership REIT (commonly referred to as an UPREIT) structure in which substantially all of its assets are owned by and substantially all of its business is conducted through MGM Growth Properties Operating Partnership LP (the “Operating Partnership”). MGP has two classes of authorized and outstanding voting common shares (collectively, the “shares”): Class A shares and a single Class B share\n. The Company owns MGP’s Class B share, which does not provide its holder any rights to profits or losses or any rights to receive distributions from operations of MGP or upon liquidation or winding up of MGP. MGP’s Class A shareholders are entitled to\none\nvote per share, while the Company, as the owner of the Class B share, holds a controlling interest in MGP as it is entitled to an amount of votes representing a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares so long as the Company and its controlled affiliates’ (excluding MGP) aggregate beneficial ownership of the combined economic interests in MGP and the Operating Partnership does not fall below\n30\n%.\nThe Company and MGP each hold Operating Partnership units representing limited partner interests in the Operating Partnership. The general partner of the Operating Partnership is a wholly owned subsidiary of MGP\n. T\nhe Operating Partnership units held by the Company are exchangeable into Class A shares of MGP on a one-to-one basis, or cash at the Fair Market Value of a Class A share (as defined in the Operating Partnership's partnership agreement)\n. The determination of settlement method is at the option of MGP’s independent conflicts committee. As of December 31, 2021, the Company owned\n41.5\n% of the Operating Partnership units, and MGP held the remaining\n58.5\n% ownership interest in the Operating Partnership.\nThe Company leases the real estate assets of The Mirage, Luxor, New York-New York, Park MGM, Excalibur, The Park, Gold Strike Tunica, MGM Grand Detroit, Beau Rivage, Borgata, Empire City, MGM National Harbor, MGM Northfield Park, and MGM Springfield pursuant to a master lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership. The Company leases the real estate assets of Bellagio pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a venture that is\n5\n% owned by such subsidiary and\n95\n% owned by a subsidiary of Blackstone Real Estate Income Trust, Inc. (“BREIT”, and such venture, the “Bellagio BREIT Venture”)\n. Additionally, the Company leases the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas, pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and a venture that is\n50.1\n% owned by a subsidiary of the Operating Partnership and\n49.9\n% by a subsidiary of BREIT (such venture, the “MGP BREIT Venture”).  Further, the Company leases the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) pursuant to a lease agreement between a subsidiary of the Company and funds managed by The Blackstone Group (\"Blackstone\"), as further discussed below. Refer to Note 11 for further discussion of the leases.\nIn January 2019, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with the Empire City Casino's racetrack and casino (\"Empire City\"). Subsequently, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and Empire City was added to the master lease between the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 4 and Note 18 for additional information.\nIn March 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the master lease with respect to improvements made by the Company related to the rebranding of the Park MGM and NoMad Las Vegas. Refer to Note 18 for additional information on this transaction, which eliminates in consolidation.\nIn April 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield Park Associates, LLC (\"Northfield\") from MGP and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM\n67\nNorthfield Park, and added it to the master lease between the Company and MGP. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.\nOn November 15, 2019, Bellagio BREIT Venture was formed, which acquired the Bellagio real estate assets from the Company and leased such assets back to the Company pursuant to a lease agreement. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, the Company received total consideration of $\n4.25\nbillion, which consisted of a\n5\n% equity interest in the venture and cash of approximately $\n4.2\nbillion. The Company recorded a gain of $\n2.7\nbillion related to sale of the Bellagio real estate assets, recorded in “Gain on REIT transactions, net” in the consolidated statements of operations, which primarily reflects the difference between the carrying value of the real estate assets sold and the consideration received. The Company also provides a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture’s $\n3.01\nbillion of debt (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon). Refer to Note 11 and Note 12 for additional information relating to the lease and guarantee, respectively.\nIn December 2019, the Company completed the sale of Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land. See Note 16 for additional information related to this transaction.\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company completed a series of transactions (collectively the “MGP BREIT Venture Transaction”) pursuant to which the real estate assets of MGM Grand Las Vegas and Mandalay Bay (including Mandalay Place) were contributed to the newly formed MGP BREIT Venture. In exchange for the contribution of the real estate assets, the Company received total consideration of\n$\n4.6\nbillion\n, which was comprised of\n$\n2.5\nbillion\nof cash, $\n1.3\nbillion of the Operating Partnership’s secured indebtedness assumed by MGP BREIT Venture, and the Operating Partnership’s\n50.1\n% equity interest in MGP BREIT Venture. In addition, the Operating Partnership issued approximately\n3\nmillion Operating Partnership units to the Company representing\n5\n% of the equity value of MGP BREIT Venture. The Company recorded the difference between consideration received of\n$\n2.5\nbillion\nand the carrying value of the MGM Grand Las Vegas real estate assets of $\n733\nmillion and selling costs of $\n27\nmillion as a net gain on sale of assets of $\n1.7\nbillion, which is reflected within “Gain on REIT transactions, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. The Company also recorded the difference between consideration received of $\n2.1\nbillion and the carrying value of the Mandalay Bay real estate assets of $\n2.3\nbillion and selling costs of $\n10\nmillion as a net loss on sale of assets of $\n252\nmillion, which is reflected within “Gain on REIT transactions, net” in the consolidated statements of operations. In connection with the transactions, the Company provides a shortfall guarantee of the principal amount of indebtedness of MGP BREIT Venture (and any interest accrued and unpaid thereon) as further discussed in Note 12. On the closing date, BREIT also purchased approximately\n5\nmillion MGP Class A shares for $\n150\nmillion\n.\nIn connection with the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction, MGP BREIT Venture entered into a lease with a subsidiary of the Company for the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas as further discussed in Note 11. Additionally, the master lease with MGP was modified to remove the Mandalay Bay property and the annual cash rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by\n$\n133\nmillion\n, as further discussed in Note 18.\nAlso, on January 14, 2020, the Company, the Operating Partnership, and MGP entered into an agreement for the Operating Partnership to waive its right following the closing of the MGP BREIT Venture Transaction to issue MGP Class A shares, in lieu of cash, to the Company in connection with the Company exercising its right to require the Operating Partnership to redeem Operating Partnership units that the Company holds, at a price per unit equal to a\n3\n% discount to the ten day average closing price prior to the date of the notice of redemption. The waiver was effective upon closing of the transaction on February 14, 2020 and was scheduled to terminate on the earlier of February 14, 2022 or upon the Company’s receipt of cash proceeds of $\n1.4\nbillion as consideration for the redemption of the Company’s Operating Partnership units. On May 18, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately\n30\nmillion Operating Partnership units that the Company held for $\n700\nmillion, or $\n23.10\nper unit, and on December 2, 2020, the Operating Partnership redeemed approximately\n24\nmillion of the Operating Partnership units that the Company held for the remaining $\n700\nmillion, or $\n29.78\nper unit. As a result, the waiver terminated in accordance with its terms.\nOn March 4, 2021, certain subsidiaries of the Company delivered a notice of redemption to MGP covering approximately\n37\nmillion Operating Partnership units that they held, as further discussed in Note 13.\nOn August 4, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with VICI Properties, Inc. (“VICI”) and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction (such transaction, the “VICI Transaction”). Pursuant to the agreement, MGP Class A shareholders will receive\n1.366\nshares of newly issued VICI stock in exchange for each MGP Class A share outstanding and the Company will receive\n1.366\nunits of the new VICI operating partnership (“VICI OP”) in exchange for each Operating Partnership unit held by the Company. The fixed exchange ratio represents an agreed upon price of $\n43\nper share of MGP Class A share to the five-day volume weighted average price of VICI stock as of the close of business on July 30, 2021. In connection with the exchange, VICI OP will redeem the majority of the Company’s VICI OP units for cash consideration of $\n4.4\nbillion, with the Company retaining an approximate $\n370\nmillion ownership\n68\ninterest in the VICI OP (based upon the close price of VICI stock as of August 3, 2021). MGP’s Class B share that is held by the Company will be cancelled. As part of the transaction, the Company will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The new master lease will have an initial term of\n25\nyears, with\nthree\n10-year\nrenewals, and initial annual rent of $\n860\nmillion, escalating annually at a rate of\n2\n% per annum for the first 10 years and thereafter equal to the greater of\n2\n% and the CPI increase during the prior year subject to a cap of\n3\n%. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021).\nOn September 26, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to acquire the operations of The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas (\"The Cosmopolitan\") for cash consideration of $\n1.625\nbillion, subject to customary working capital adjustments.\nPursuant to the agreement, the Company is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the transaction has not closed on or before June 26, 2022, which date may be extended by either party to a date on or prior to September 26, 2022 under certain circumstances. The agreement contemplates a reverse termination fee of $\n500\nmillion that is payable by the Company in the event that the parties are unable to obtain antitrust or gaming regulatory approval.\nAdditionally, the Company will enter into a lease agreement for the real estate assets of The Cosmopolitan. The Cosmopolitan lease will have an initial term of\n30\nyears with\nthree\nsubsequent\n10\n-year renewal periods, exercisable at the Company’s option. The initial term of the lease provides for an initial annual cash rent of $\n200\nmillion with a fixed\n2\n% escalator for the first 15 years, and thereafter, an escalator equal to the greater of\n2\n% and the CPI increase during the prior year, subject to a cap of\n3\n%. Additionally, the lease will require the Company to spend a specified percentage of net revenues over a rolling 5-year period at the property on capital expenditures and for the Company to comply with certain financial covenants, which, if not met, would require the Company to maintain cash security or one or more letters of credit in favor of the landlord in an amount equal to rent for the succeeding 1-year period. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nOn September 27, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of the\n50\n% ownership interest in CityCenter Holdings, LLC (\"CityCenter\") held by Infinity World Development Corp (\"Infinity World\"), a wholly owned subsidiary of Dubai World, a Dubai, United Arab Emirates government decree entity. CityCenter is located between Bellagio and Park MGM and consists of Aria, an integrated casino, hotel and entertainment resort; and Vdara, a luxury condominium-hotel. Refer to Note 4 for additional information on this acquisition.\nOn September 28, 2021, the Company sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) to funds managed by The Blackstone Group Inc. (\"Blackstone\") for cash consideration of $\n3.89\nbillion and entered into a lease through which the real property is leased back to a subsidiary of the Company, as further discussed in Note 11.\nOn October 29, 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from the Company and MGM Springfield was added to the MGP master lease between the Company and MGP through which MGP leases back the real property to a subsidiary of the Company. Transactions with MGP, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. Refer to Note 18 for additional information.\nOn December 13, 2021, the Company entered into an agreement to sell the operations of The Mirage to an affiliate of Seminole Hard Rock Entertainment, Inc. (\"Hard Rock\") for cash consideration of $\n1.075\nbillion, subject to certain purchase price adjustments. Pursuant to the agreement, Hard Rock is obligated to use its reasonable best efforts to obtain the requisite antitrust and gaming regulatory approvals. The agreement may be terminated by either party if the closing has not occurred on or before December 13, 2022, which date may be extended by either party to March 13, 2023 under certain circumstances. The agreement contemplates a reverse termination fee of $\n322.5\nmillion that is payable by Hard Rock to the Company in the event that the parties are unable to obtain antitrust or gaming regulatory approval. Upon closing, the master lease between the Company and VICI (or MGP in the event that the VICI Transaction is terminated) will be amended and restated to reflect a $\n90\nmillion reduction in annual cash rent. The transaction is expected to close during the second half of 2022, subject to certain closing conditions, including, but not limited to, the consummation or termination of the VICI Transaction and receipt of regulatory approvals.\nThe Company has an approximate\n56\n%\ncontrolling interest in MGM China Holdings Limited (together with its subsidiaries, “MGM China”), which owns MGM Grand Paradise, S.A. (“MGM Grand Paradise”). MGM Grand Paradise owns and operates the MGM Macau and MGM Cotai,\ntwo\nintegrated casino, hotel and entertainment resorts in Macau, as well as the related gaming subconcession and land concessions.\nGaming in Macau is currently administered by the Macau Government through concessions awarded to three different concessionaires and three subconcessionaires, of which a subsidiary of MGM China, MGM Grand Paradise, is a subconcessionaire. In 2019, the expiration of MGM Grand Paradise’s subconcession term was extended from March 31, 2020 to June 26, 2022, consistent with the expiration of the other concessionaires and subconcessionaires. Pursuant to the\n69\nMacau gaming law, upon reaching the maximum duration of 20 years, the term of the concessions may be extended one or more times by order of the Chief Executive, which period may not exceed, in total, 5 years. On January 14, 2022, the Macau Government disclosed the content of a bill to amend Macau gaming law, which followed a 45-day public consultation process regarding draft amendment proposals that were issued in September 2021. Under the bill the existing subconcessions will be discontinued and a maximum of six concessions will be awarded for a term to be specified in the concession contract that may not exceed 10 years and which may be extended by three years under certain circumstances. The bill is subject to debate and approval by the Macau Legislative Assembly. The approval of the new gaming law bill will precede the public tender for the awarding of new gaming concessions and to date the Macau Government has provided no indication as to whether the public tender will take place before expiry of the existing gaming concessions and subconcessions but acknowledged that it could consider the extension of the existing concessions and subconcessions beyond their current term if the public tender is held at a later date. Unless MGM Grand Paradise's gaming subconcession is extended or legislation with regard to reversion of casino premises is amended the casino area premises and gaming-related equipment subject to reversion will automatically be transferred to the Macau Government upon expiration, and MGM China will cease to generate any revenues from such gaming operations. In addition, certain events relating to the loss, termination, rescission, revocation or modification of MGM Grand Paradise’s gaming subconcession in Macau, where such events have a material adverse effect on the financial condition, business, properties, or results of operations of MGM China, taken as a whole, may result in a special put option triggering event under MGM China’s senior notes and in an event of default under MGM China’s revolving credit facilities. MGM China continues to closely monitor developments regarding the retendering process or concession extensions including the issuance of guidance by the Macau Government. MGM China intends to respond proactively to all relevant Macau Government requirements when known relating to the  process. Management cannot provide any assurance that the gaming subconcession will be extended beyond the current term or that it will be able to obtain a gaming concession in a public tender; however, management believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held.\nThe Company owns\n50\n% of BetMGM, LLC (“BetMGM”), which provides online sports betting and iGaming in certain jurisdictions in the United States. The other\n50\n% of BetMGM is owned by Entain plc.\nThe Company has\nthree\nreportable segments: Las Vegas Strip Resorts, Regional Operations and MGM China. See Note 17 for additional information about the Company’s segments.\nFinancial Impact of COVID-19.\nThe spread of the novel 2019 coronavirus (“COVID-19”) and developments surrounding the global pandemic have had a significant impact on the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows in 2020 and 2021 and may continue to impact the Company's business in 2022 and thereafter. In March 2020, all of the Company’s domestic properties were temporarily closed pursuant to state and local government restrictions imposed as a result of COVID-19. Throughout the second and third quarters of 2020, all of the Company’s properties that were temporarily closed re-opened to the public, with temporary re-closures and re-openings occurring for certain of the Company’s properties or portions thereof into the first quarter of 2021. Upon re-opening, the properties continued to operate without certain amenities and subject to certain occupancy limitations, with restrictions varying by jurisdiction. Beginning in the latter part of the first quarter of 2021 and continuing into the second quarter of 2021, the Company’s domestic jurisdictions eased and removed prior operating restrictions, including capacity and occupancy limits, as well as social distancing policies.\nAlthough all of the Company’s properties have re-opened, in light of the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, including the emergence and spread of COVID-19 variants, the properties may be subject to new operating restrictions and/or temporary, complete, or partial shutdowns in the future. At this time, the Company cannot predict whether jurisdictions, states or the federal government will adopt similar or more restrictive measures in the future than in the past, including stay-at-home orders or the temporary closure of all or a portion of the Company’s properties as a result of the pandemic.\nIn Macau, following a temporary closure of the Company’s properties on February 5, 2020, operations resumed on February 20, 2020, subject to certain health safeguards, such as limiting the number of seats available at each table game, slot machine spacing, reduced operating hours at a number of restaurants and bars, temperature checks, and mask protection. Although the issuance of tourist visas (including the individual visit scheme) for residents of Zhuhai, Guangdong Province and all other provinces in mainland China to travel to Macau resumed on August 12, 2020, August 26, 2020 and September 23, 2020, respectively, several travel and entry restrictions in Macau, Hong Kong and mainland China remain in place (including the temporary suspension of ferry services between Hong Kong and Macau, the negative nucleic acid test result certificate, and mandatory quarantine requirements for returning residents, for visitors from Hong Kong, Taiwan, and certain regions in mainland China, and bans on entry on other visitors), which significantly impacted visitation to the Company’s Macau properties. In the third and fourth quarters of 2021, local COVID-19 cases were identified in Macau. Upon such occurrences, a state of immediate prevention was declared and mass mandatory nucleic acid testing was imposed in Macau, the validity period of negative test results for re-entry into mainland China was shortened and quarantine requirements were imposed, certain events were cancelled or suspended, and in some instances,\n70\ncertain entertainment and leisure facilities were closed throughout Macau. Although gaming and hotel operations have remained open during these states of immediate prevention, such measures have had a negative effect on the Company's operations and it is uncertain whether further closures, including the closure of the Company’s properties, or travel restrictions to Macau will be implemented if additional local COVID-19 cases are identified.\nNOTE 2 —\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nPrinciples of consolidation.\nThe\nCompany evaluates entities for which control is achieved through means other than voting rights to determine if it is the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity (“VIE”). A VIE is an entity in which either (i) the equity investors as a group, if any, lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance or (ii) the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity’s activities without additional subordinated financial support. The Company identifies the primary beneficiary of a VIE as the enterprise that has both of the following characteristics: (i) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the entity’s economic performance; and (ii) the obligation to absorb losses or receive benefits of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the entity. The Company consolidates its investment in a VIE when it determines that it is its primary beneficiary. For these VIEs, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company may change its original assessment of a VIE upon subsequent events such as the modification of contractual arrangements that affect the characteristics or adequacy of the entity’s equity investments at risk and the disposition of all or a portion of an interest held by the primary beneficiary. The Company performs this analysis on an ongoing basis\n.\nManagement has determined that MGP is a VIE because the Class A equity investors as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is the primary beneficiary of MGP and consolidates MGP because (i) its ownership of MGP’s single Class B share entitles it to a majority of the total voting power of MGP’s shares, and (ii) the exchangeable nature of the Operating Partnership units owned provide the Company the right to receive benefits from MGP that could potentially be significant to MGP. The Company has recorded MGP’s ownership interest in the Operating Partnership as noncontrolling interest in the Company’s consolidated financial statements. As of December 31, 2021, on a consolidated basis MGP had total assets of $\n10.4\nbillion, primarily related to its real estate investments, and total liabilities of $\n5.1\nbillion, primarily related to its indebtedness.\nManagement has determined that Bellagio BREIT Venture is a VIE because the equity holders as a group lack the power through voting or similar rights to direct the activities of such entity that most significantly impact such entity’s economic performance. The Company has determined that it is not the primary beneficiary of Bellagio BREIT Venture and, accordingly, does not consolidate the venture, because the Company does not have power to direct the activities that could potentially be significant to the venture; BREIT, as the managing member, has such power. The Company has recorded its\n5\n% ownership interest in Bellagio BREIT Venture as an investment in unconsolidated affiliates in the Company’s consolidated financial statements, for which such amount was $\n58\nmillion as of December 31, 2021. The Company’s maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with Bellagio BREIT Venture is equal to the carrying value of its investment, assuming no future capital funding requirements, plus the exposure to loss resulting from the Company’s guarantee of the debt of Bellagio BREIT Venture, which guarantee is immaterial as of December 31, 2021, as further discussed in Note 12.\nFor entities determined not to be a VIE, the Company consolidates such entities in which the Company owns\n100\n% of the equity. For entities in which the Company owns less than 100% of the equity interest, the Company consolidates the entity under the voting interest model if it has a controlling financial interest based upon the terms of the respective entities’ ownership agreements, such as MGM China. For these entities, the Company records a noncontrolling interest in the consolidated balance sheets and all intercompany balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation. If the entity does not qualify for consolidation under the voting interest model and the Company has significant influence over the operating and financial decisions of the entity, the Company accounts for the entity under the equity method, such as the Company’s investments in MGP BREIT Venture and BetMGM, which do not qualify for consolidation as the Company has joint control, given the entities are structured with substantive participating rights whereby both owners participate in the decision making process, which prevents the Company from exerting a controlling financial interest in such entities, as defined in ASC 810.\nFor equity interests in entities in which the Company does not have significant influence, the Company records its equity investment under ASC 321 and reflects such investments within “Other long-term assets, net” on the consolidated balance sheets.\nThe fair value of such equity investments was $\n66\nmillion as of\nDecember 31, 2021\n.\nReclassifications\n. Certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period presentation.\n71\nManagement’s use of estimates.\nThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These principles require the Company’s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nFair value measurements.\nFair value measurements affect the Company’s accounting and impairment assessments of its long-lived assets, investments in unconsolidated affiliates or equity interests, assets acquired, and liabilities assumed in an acquisition, and goodwill and other intangible assets. Fair value measurements also affect the Company’s accounting for certain of its financial assets and liabilities. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date and is measured according to a hierarchy that includes: Level 1 inputs, such as quoted prices in an active market; Level 2 inputs, which are observable inputs for similar assets; or Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable inputs.\nThe Company used the following inputs in its fair value measurements:\n•\nLevel 1 inputs when measuring its equity investments under ASC 321;\n•\nLevel 1 and Level 2 inputs for its long-term debt fair value disclosures. See Note 9;\n•\nLevel 2 inputs when measuring the Operating Partnership’s fair value of its interest rate swaps. See Note 9;\n•\nLevel 1, Level 2, and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the CityCenter acquisition. See Note 4; and\n•\nLevel 2 and Level 3 inputs when assessing the fair value of the note receivable relating to the Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land sale.\nSee Note 16.\nCash and cash equivalents.\nCash and cash equivalents include cash on hand, investments and interest-bearing instruments with maturities of 90 days or less at the date of acquisition. Such investments are carried at cost, which approximates market value. Book overdraft balances resulting from the Company’s cash management program are recorded as “Accounts payable” or “Construction payable” as applicable.\nRestricted cash.\nRestricted cash reflects cash held in an escrow account related to the reverse termination fee that was contractually required to be prefunded for The Cosmopolitan acquisition\nand is reflected as \"Restricted Cash\" on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021. \"Restricted Cash\" and \"Cash and cash equivalents\" on the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 equal \"Cash, cash equivalents, and restricted cash\" on the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAccounts receivable and credit risk.\nFinancial instruments that potentially subject the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of casino accounts receivable. The Company issues credit following background checks and investigations of creditworthiness. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, approximately\n43\n% and\n52\n%, respectively, of the Company’s gross casino accounts receivable were owed by customers from foreign countries, primarily within Asia. Business or economic conditions or other significant events in these countries could affect the collectability of such receivables.\nAccounts receivable are typically non-interest bearing and are initially recorded at cost. Accounts are written off when management deems the account to be uncollectible. Recoveries of accounts previously written off are recorded when received. An estimated loss reserve is maintained to reduce the Company’s receivables to their net carrying amount, which approximates fair value. The loss reserve is estimated based on both a specific review of customer accounts as well as historical collection experience and current and expected future economic and business conditions. Management believes that as of December 31, 2021, no significant concentrations of credit risk existed for which a loss reserve had not already been recorded.\nInventories.\nInventories consist primarily of food and beverage, retail merchandise and operating supplies, and are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is determined primarily using the average cost method for food and beverage and operating supplies. Cost for retail merchandise is determined using the cost method.\nProperty and equipment.\nProperty and equipment are stated at cost. A significant amount of the Company’s property and equipment was acquired through business combinations and therefore recognized at fair value at the acquisition date. Gains or losses on dispositions of property and equipment are included in the determination of income or loss. Maintenance costs are expensed as incurred.\n72\nProperty and equipment are generally depreciated over the following estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis:\nThe Company evaluates its property and equipment and other long-lived assets for impairment based on its classification as held for sale or to be held and used. Several criteria must be met before an asset is classified as held for sale, including that management with the appropriate authority commits to a plan to sell the asset at a reasonable price in relation to its fair value and is actively seeking a buyer. For assets held for sale, the Company recognizes the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value less costs to sell, as estimated based on comparable asset sales, offers received, or a discounted cash flow model. For assets to be held and used, the Company reviews for impairment whenever indicators of impairment exist. The Company then compares the estimated future cash flows of the asset, on an undiscounted basis, to the carrying value of the asset. If the undiscounted cash flows exceed the carrying value, no impairment is indicated. If the undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value, then an impairment charge is recorded based on the fair value of the asset, typically measured using a discounted cash flow model. If an asset is still under development, future cash flows include remaining construction costs. All recognized impairment losses, whether for assets held for sale or assets to be held and used, are recorded as operating expenses.\nRefer to Note 16 for discussion on the impairment loss recorded on Circus Circus Las Vegas and adjacent land in 2019.\nCapitalized interest.\nThe interest cost associated with major development and construction projects is capitalized and included in the cost of the project. When no debt is incurred specifically for a project, interest is capitalized on amounts expended on the project using the weighted average cost of the Company’s outstanding borrowings. Capitalization of interest ceases when the project is substantially complete, or development activity is suspended for more than a brief period.\nInvestments in and advances to unconsolidated affiliates.\nThe Company has investments in unconsolidated affiliates accounted for under the equity method. Under the equity method, carrying value is adjusted for the Company’s share of the investees’ earnings and losses, amortization of certain basis differences, as well as capital contributions to and distributions from these companies. Distributions in excess of equity method earnings are recognized as a return of investment and recorded as investing cash inflows in the accompanying consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company classifies operating income and losses as well as gains and impairments related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of operating income or loss and classifies non-operating income or losses related to its investments in unconsolidated affiliates as a component of non-operating income or loss, as the Company’s investments in such unconsolidated affiliates are an extension of the Company’s core business operations.\nThe Company evaluates its investments in unconsolidated affiliates for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its investment may have experienced an other-than-temporary decline in value. If such conditions exist, the Company compares the estimated fair value of the investment to its carrying value to determine if an impairment is indicated and determines whether the impairment is “other-than-temporary” based on its assessment of all relevant factors, including consideration of the Company’s intent and ability to retain its investment. The Company estimates fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis based on estimated future results of the investee and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group.\nGoodwill and other intangible assets.\nGoodwill represents the excess of purchase price over fair market value of net assets acquired in business combinations. Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets must be reviewed for impairment at least annually and between annual test dates in certain circumstances. The Company performs its annual impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year.\nNo\nmaterial impairments were indicated or recorded as a result of the annual impairment review for goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets in 2021, 2020, and 2019.\nAccounting guidance provides entities the option to perform a qualitative assessment of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets (commonly referred to as “step zero”) in order to determine whether further impairment testing is necessary. In performing the step zero analysis the Company considers macroeconomic conditions, industry and market considerations, current and forecasted financial performance, entity-specific events, and changes in the composition or carrying amount of net assets of reporting units for goodwill. In addition, the Company takes into consideration the amount of excess of fair value over carrying value determined in the last quantitative analysis that was performed, as well as the\n73\nperiod of time that has passed since the last quantitative analysis. If the step zero analysis indicates that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than its carrying amount, the entity would proceed to a quantitative analysis.\nUnder the quantitative analysis, goodwill for relevant reporting units is tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the estimated future results of the Company’s reporting units discounted using market discount rates and market indicators of terminal year capitalization rates, and a market approach that utilizes business enterprise value multiples based on a range of multiples from the Company’s peer group. If the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment charge is recognized equal to the difference. Under the quantitative analysis, license rights are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow approach, and trademarks are tested for impairment using the relief-from-royalty method. If the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset is less than its carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference.\nRevenue recognition.\nThe Company’s revenue from contracts with customers consists of casino wagers transactions, hotel room sales, food and beverage transactions, entertainment shows, and retail transactions.\nThe transaction price for a casino wager is the difference between gaming wins and losses (“net win”). In certain circumstances, the Company offers discounts on markers, which is estimated based upon historical business practice, and recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. Commissions rebated to gaming promoters and VIP players at MGM China are also recorded as a reduction of casino revenue. The Company accounts for casino revenue on a portfolio basis given the similar characteristics of wagers by recognizing net win per gaming day versus on an individual wager basis.\nFor casino wager transactions that include other goods and services provided by the Company to gaming patrons on a discretionary basis to incentivize gaming, the Company allocates revenue from the casino wager transaction to the good or service delivered based upon standalone selling price (“SSP”). Discretionary goods and services provided by the Company and supplied by third parties are recognized as an operating expense.\nFor casino wager transactions that include incentives earned by customers under the Company’s loyalty programs, the Company allocates a portion of net win based upon the SSP of such incentive (less estimated breakage). This allocation is deferred and recognized as revenue when the customer redeems the incentive. When redeemed, revenue is recognized in the department that provides the goods or service. Redemption of loyalty incentives at third-party outlets are deducted from the loyalty liability and amounts owed are paid to the third party, with any discount received recorded as other revenue.\nAfter allocating revenue to other goods and services provided as part of casino wager transactions, the Company records the residual amount to casino revenue\n.\nThe transaction price of rooms, food and beverage, and retail contracts is the net amount collected from the customer for such goods and services. The transaction price for such contracts is recorded as revenue when the good or service is transferred to the customer over their stay at the hotel or when the delivery is made for the food & beverage and retail & other contracts. Sales and usage-based taxes are excluded from revenues. For some arrangements, the Company acts as an agent in that it arranges for another party to transfer goods and services and the Company is not the controlling entity, which primarily include certain of the Company’s entertainment shows and, in certain jurisdictions, the Company’s arrangement with BetMGM for online sports betting and iGaming.\nThe Company also has other contracts that include multiple goods and services, such as packages that bundle food, beverage, or entertainment offerings with hotel stays and convention services. For such arrangements, the Company allocates revenue to each good or service based on its relative SSP. The Company primarily determines the SSP of rooms, food and beverage, entertainment, and retail goods and services based on the amount that the Company charges when sold separately in similar circumstances to similar customers.\nContract and Contract-Related Liabilities.\nThere may be a difference between the timing of cash receipts from the customer and the recognition of revenue, resulting in a contract or contract-related liability. The Company generally has three types of liabilities related to contracts with customers: (1) outstanding chip liability, which represents the amounts owed in exchange for gaming chips held by a customer, (2) loyalty program obligations, which represents the deferred allocation of revenue relating to loyalty program incentives earned, as discussed above, and (3) customer advances and other, which is primarily funds deposited by customers before gaming play occurs (“casino front money”) and advance payments on goods and services yet to be provided such as advance ticket sales and deposits on rooms and convention space or for unpaid wagers. These liabilities are generally expected to be recognized as revenue within one year of being purchased, earned, or deposited and are recorded within “Other accrued liabilities” on the consolidated balance sheets.\n74\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to contract and contract-related liabilities:\nReimbursed cost.\nCosts reimbursed pursuant to management services are recognized as revenue in the period it incurs the costs as this reflects when the Company performs its related performance obligation and is entitled to reimbursement. Reimbursed costs related primarily to the Company’s management of CityCenter (such management agreement was terminated upon the acquisition of CityCenter in September 2021).\nRevenue by source.\nThe Company presents the revenue earned disaggregated by the type or nature of the good or service (casino, room, food and beverage, and entertainment, retail and other) and by relevant geographic region within\nNote 17.\nLeases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is or contains a lease at inception or modification of the arrangement. An arrangement is or contains a lease if there are identified assets and the right to control the use of an identified asset is conveyed for a period of time in exchange for consideration. Control over the use of the identified asset means the lessee has both the right to obtain substantially all of the economic benefits from the use of the asset and the right to direct the use of the asset.\nThe Company classifies a lease with terms greater than twelve months as either operating or finance. At commencement date, the right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term. The initial measurement of the operating lease ROU assets also includes any prepaid lease payments and are reduced by any previously accrued deferred rent. When available, such as for the Company’s triple-net operating leases for which the lessor has provided its implicit rate or provided the assumptions required for the Company to readily determine the rate implicit in the lease, the Company uses the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments to present value. However, for most of the Company’s leases, such as its equipment leases, the Company cannot readily determine the implicit rate. Accordingly, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rate to discount the lease payments for such leases based on the information available at the commencement date. Lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that such option will be exercised. The Company’s triple-net operating leases each contain renewal periods at the Company’s option, each of which are not considered to be reasonably certain of being exercised. Many of the Company’s leases include fixed rental escalation clauses that are factored into the determination of lease payments. For operating leases, lease expense for minimum lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the expected lease term. For finance leases, the ROU asset depreciates on a straight-line basis over the shorter of the lease term or useful life of the ROU asset and the lease liability accretes interest based on the interest method using the discount rate determined at lease commencement.\nRefer to Note 11 for discussion of leases under which the Company is a lessee. The master lease agreement with MGP is eliminated in consolidation; refer to Note 18 for further discussion of the master lease with MGP.\nThe Company is a lessor under certain other lease arrangements.\nLease revenues earned by the Company from third parties are classified within the line item corresponding to the type or nature of the tenant’s good or service. Lease revenues from third-party tenants include $\n43\nmillion, $\n24\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion recorded within food and beverage revenue for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and $\n85\nmillion, $\n60\nmillion and $\n89\nmillion recorded within entertainment, retail, and other revenue for the same such periods, respectively. Lease revenues from the rental of hotel rooms are recorded as rooms revenues within the consolidated statements of operations.\nAdvertising.\nThe Company expenses advertising costs as incurred.\nAdvertising expense that primarily relates to media placement costs and which is generally included in general and administrative expenses, was $\n121\nmillion, $\n88\nmillion and $\n195\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCorporate expense.\nCorporate expense represents unallocated payroll, professional fees and various other expenses not directly related to the Company’s casino resort operations. In addition, corporate expense includes the costs associated with the Company’s evaluation and pursuit of new business opportunities, which are expensed as incurred.\n75\nPreopening and start-up expenses.\nPreopening and start-up costs, including organizational costs, are expensed as incurred. Costs classified as preopening and start-up expenses include payroll, outside services, advertising, and other expenses related to new or start-up operations.\nProperty transactions, net.\nThe Company classifies transactions such as write-downs and impairments, demolition costs, and normal gains and losses on the sale of assets as “Property transactions, net.” See Note 16 for a detailed discussion of these amounts.\nRedeemable noncontrolling interest.\nCertain noncontrolling interest parties have non-voting economic interests in MGM National Harbor which provide for annual preferred distributions by MGM National Harbor to the noncontrolling interest parties based on a percentage of its annual net gaming revenue (as defined in the MGM National Harbor operating agreement). Such distributions are accrued each quarter and are paid 90 days after the end of each fiscal year. The noncontrolling interest parties each have the ability to require MGM National Harbor to purchase all or a portion of their interests for a purchase price based on a contractually agreed upon formula.\nThe Company has recorded the interests as “Redeemable noncontrolling interests” in the mezzanine section of the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and not stockholders’ equity because their redemption is not exclusively in the Company’s control. The interests were initially accounted for at fair value. Subsequently, the Company recognizes changes in the redemption value as they occur and adjusts the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests to equal the maximum redemption value, provided such amount does not fall below the initial carrying value, at the end of each reporting period. The Company records any changes caused by such an adjustment in capital in excess of par value. Additionally, the carrying amount of the redeemable noncontrolling interests is adjusted for accrued annual preferred distributions, with changes caused by such adjustments recorded within net income (loss) attributable to noncontrolling interests.\nIncome per share of common stock.\nThe table below reconciles basic and diluted income per share of common stock. Diluted net income attributable to common stockholders includes adjustments for redeemable noncontrolling interests.\nDiluted weighted average common and common equivalent shares include adjustments for potential dilution of share-based awards outstanding under the Company’s stock compensation plan.\nCurrency translation.\nThe Company translates the financial statements of foreign subsidiaries that are not denominated in U.S. dollars. Balance sheet accounts are translated at the exchange rate in effect at each balance sheet date. Income statement accounts are translated at the average rate of exchange prevailing during the period. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (loss). Gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurements are recorded to other non-operating income (expense).\nAccumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nComprehensive income (loss) includes net income (loss) and all other non-stockholder changes in equity, or other comprehensive income (loss). Elements of the Company’s accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are reported in the consolidated statements of stockholders’ equity.\n76\nNOTE 3 —\nACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, NET\nAccounts receivable, net consisted of the following:\nNOTE 4 —\nACQUISITIONS\nCityCenter\nOn September 27, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of Infinity World's\n50\n% ownership interest in CityCenter for cash consideration of $\n2.125\nbillion.\nThrough the acquisition, the Company obtained\n100\n% of the equity interests in CityCenter and therefore consolidated CityCenter as of September 27, 2021. Prior to the acquisition, the Company held a\n50\n% ownership interest, which was accounted for under the equity method. The fair value of the equity interests of CityCenter was determined by the transaction price and equaled $\n4.25\nbillion. The carrying value of the Company's equity method investment was less than its share of the fair value of CityCenter at the acquisition date, resulting in a net gain of $\n1.6\nbillion upon consolidation, which is recognized as \"Gain on consolidation of CityCenter, net\" on the consolidated statements of operations.\nOn September 28, 2021, the Company sold the real estate assets of Aria (including Vdara) for cash consideration of $\n3.89\nbillion and entered into a lease agreement pursuant to which the Company leases back the real property. The Company classified the real estate assets as held for sale as of the acquisition date and accordingly measured the real estate assets at fair value less costs to sell, as reflected in the table below. See Note 11 for additional information regarding the lease.\nThe Company recognized\n100\n% of the assets and liabilities of CityCenter at fair value at the date of the acquisition. Under the acquisition method, the fair value was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction. The Company estimated fair value using level 1 inputs, level 2 inputs, and level 3 inputs.\nThe following table sets forth the purchase price allocation (in thousands):\nThe Company recognized the identifiable intangible assets of CityCenter at fair value, which consisted of indefinite-lived trade names, which was determined using methodologies under the relief from royalty method based on significant\n77\ninputs that were not observable. The goodwill is primarily attributable to the profitability of CityCenter in excess of identifiable assets, of which approximately\n50\n% of the goodwill is deductible for income tax purposes. All of the goodwill was assigned to the Company’s Las Vegas Strip Resorts segment.\nResults.\nCityCenter’s net revenue for the period from September 27, 2021 through December 31, 2021 was $\n367\nmillion and operating income and net income were $\n69\nmillion and $\n68\nmillion, respectively.\nUnaudited pro forma information.\nThe operating results for CityCenter are included in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations from the date of acquisition. The following unaudited pro forma consolidated financial information for the Company has been prepared assuming the Company’s acquisition of its controlling interest had occurred as of January 1, 2020 and excludes the gain on consolidation discussed above. The pro forma information does not reflect transactions that occurred subsequent to acquisition, such as the subsequent sale-leaseback transaction or the repayment of CityCenter's assumed debt.\nThe unaudited pro forma financial information below is not necessarily indicative of either future results of operations or results that might have been achieved had the acquisition been consummated as of January 1, 2020.\nEmpire City\nOn January 29, 2019, the Company acquired the real property and operations associated with Empire City for total consideration of approximately $\n865\nmillion, plus customary working capital and other adjustments. The fair value of consideration paid included the issuance of approximately $\n266\nmillion of the Company’s common stock, the incurrence of a new bridge facility, and the remaining balance in cash. If Empire City is awarded a license for live table games on or prior to December 31, 2022 and the Company accepts such license by December 31, 2024, the Company will pay additional consideration of $\n50\nmillion. The acquisition expands the Company’s presence in the northeast region and greater New York City market. Subsequent to the Company’s acquisition, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company and Empire City was added to the master lease between the Company and MGP\n. See Note 18 for additional information.\nFor the period from January 29, 2019 through December 31, 2019, Empire City’s net revenue was\n$\n193\nmillion\n, operating income was\n$\n12\nmillion\nand net income was\n$\n36\nmillion\n. Pro forma results of operations for the acquisition have not been presented because it is not material to the consolidated results of operations.\nNorthfield\nIn April 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP, and MGP retained the associated real estate assets.

(\"SJMSA\", formerly Sociedade de Jogos de Macau, S.A.), a gaming subconcession was acquired by MGM Grand Paradise for the right to operate casino games of chance and other casino games for a period commencing on April 20, 2005 through March 31, 2020. In March 2019, MGM Grand Paradise and SJMSA\nentered into a Subconcession Extension Contract (the “Extension Agreement”), pursuant to which the gaming subconcession was extended to June 26, 2022, which coincides with the current expiration of all the other concessions and subconcessions.\nMGM Grand Paradise paid the government of Macau approximately $\n25\nmillion and paid SJMSA approximately $\n2\nmillion as a contract premium for such extension. The Company cannot provide any assurance that MGM Grand Paradise will be awarded a gaming concession subsequent to the expiration of its gaming subconcession; however, as further discussed in Note 1, management believes that MGM Grand Paradise will be successful in obtaining a gaming concession when a public tender is held. Accordingly, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company amortizes the gaming subconcession intangible asset on a straight-line basis over the initial term of the Cotai land concession through January 2038.\nMGM National Harbor and MGM Springfield gaming licenses.\nThe license fee paid to the State of Maryland of $\n22\nmillion is considered a finite-lived intangible asset that is amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of its initial term of\n15\nyears, beginning in December 2016, when MGM National Harbor started operations.

Fair value was estimated using quoted market prices for the Company’s senior notes and credit facilities.\nNOTE 10 —\nINCOME TAXES\nThe Company recognizes deferred income tax assets, net of applicable reserves, related to net operating losses, tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences. The Company recognizes future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not. Otherwise, a valuation allowance is applied.\nIncome (loss) before income taxes for domestic and foreign operations consisted of the following:\n87\nThe benefit (provision) for income taxes attributable to income (loss) before income taxes is as follows:\nA reconciliation of the federal income tax statutory rate and the Company’s effective tax rate is as follows:\n88\nThe tax-effected components of the Company’s net deferred tax liability are as follows:\nIn March 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was signed into law. The CARES Act contains certain income tax provisions that are beneficial to the Company; namely, the relaxation of the interest expense deduction limitation for the 2019 and 2020 tax years and the allowance of a\n5\n-year carryback of net operating losses (“NOLs”) incurred during tax years 2018 through 2020. The Company has recorded a federal income tax receivable of $\n226\nmillion to reflect the carryback of its 2020 NOL. Furthermore, since the NOL was carried back to tax years when the federal income tax rate was\n35\n%, compared to the\n21\n% rate currently in effect, the Company realized $\n90\nmillion more income tax benefit than if it would have only been able to carry the NOL forward.\nThe Company has recorded a valuation allowance of $\n2.7\nbillion on its foreign tax credit (“FTC”) carryover of $\n3.1\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, resulting in an FTC net deferred tax asset of $\n332\nmillion. The FTCs are attributable to the Macau Special Gaming Tax, which is\n35\n% of gross gaming revenue in Macau. Because MGM Grand Paradise is presently exempt from the Macau\n12\n% complementary tax on gaming profits, the Company believes that payment of the Macau Special Gaming Tax qualifies as a tax paid in lieu of an income tax that is creditable against U.S. taxes. While the Company generally does not expect to generate new FTC carryovers after the year ended December 31, 2017, it will be able to utilize its existing FTC carryovers to the extent that it has active foreign source income during the\n10\n-year FTC carryforward period. Such foreign source income includes the recapture, to the extent of 50% of U.S. taxable income each year, of overall domestic losses that totaled $\n1.3\nbillion at December 31, 2021. The Company relies on future U.S. source\n89\noperating income in assessing utilization of the overall domestic losses and, by extension, future FTC realization during the 10-year FTC carryover period. The FTC carryovers will expire if not utilized as follows: $\n297\nmillion in 2022; $\n976\nmillion in 2023; $\n780\nmillion in 2024; $\n674\nmillion in 2025; $\n134\nmillion in 2026; and $\n200\nmillion in 2027.\nThe Company’s assessment of the realization of its FTC deferred tax asset is based on available evidence, including assumptions concerning future U.S. operating profits and foreign source income. As a result, significant judgment is required in assessing the possible need for a valuation allowance and changes to such assumptions could result in a material change in the valuation allowance with a corresponding impact on the provision for income taxes in the period including such change.\nOn March 30, 2020, MGM Grand Paradise was granted an extension of its exemption from the Macau\n12\n% complementary tax on gaming profits through June 26, 2022, concurrent with the end of the term of its current gaming subconcession. Absent the exemption from complementary tax on gaming profits, “Net income attributable to MGM Resorts International” would have decreased by $\n10\nmillion in 2021 and increased by $\n4\nmillion in 2020 and diluted earnings per share would have decreased by $\n0.02\nin 2021 and increased by $\n0.01\nin 2020. The Company continues to assume that MGM Grand Paradise will pay the Macau\n12\n% complementary tax on gaming profits for all periods beyond June 26, 2022 and has factored that assumption into the measurement of Macau deferred tax assets and liabilities.\nNon-gaming operations remain subject to the Macau complementary tax. At December 31, 2021, MGM Grand Paradise had a complementary tax NOL carryforward of $\n1.5\nbillion resulting from non-gaming operations that will expire if not utilized in years 2022 through 2024.\nMGM Grand Paradise’s exemption from the\n12\n% complementary tax on gaming profits does not apply to dividend distributions of such profits to MGM China. On July 26, 2021, MGM Grand Paradise extended its agreement with the Macau government to settle the\n12\n% complementary tax that would otherwise be due by its shareholder, MGM China, on distributions of its gaming profits by paying a flat annual payment regardless of the amount of distributable dividends. The extension covers distributions of gaming profits earned for the period April 1, 2020 through June 26, 2022. The agreement requires payments of approximately $\n1\nmillion for the period April 1, 2020 through December 31, 2020, $\n2\nmillion for January 1, 2021 through December 31, 2021, and $\n1\nmillion for the period January 1, 2022 through June 26, 2022. The Company recorded $\n3\nmillion of income tax expense during the year ended December 31, 2021 under the extension.\nThe Company has NOLs in certain of the states in which it operates that total $\n536\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, which equates to deferred tax assets of $\n35\nmillion after federal tax effect and before valuation allowance. The majority of these NOL carryforwards will expire if not utilized by 2025 through 2040 with the remaining being carried forward indefinitely. The Company has provided a valuation allowance of $\n6\nmillion on certain of its state deferred tax assets, including a portion of NOLs described above.\nIn addition, there is a valuation allowance of $\n146\nmillion on certain Macau deferred tax assets, and a valuation allowance of $\n3\nmillion on Hong Kong NOLs because the Company believes these assets do not meet the “more likely than not” criteria for recognition.\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amounts of gross unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $\n11\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense, which were not material for each of the periods presented.\n90\nThe Company files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, various state and local jurisdictions, and foreign jurisdictions, although the income taxes paid in foreign jurisdictions are not material. As of December 31, 2021, the IRS can generally no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2016. During the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, the Company reached a settlement with the IRS Appeals Office on the examination of its 2014 U.S. consolidated federal income tax return. No cash tax payments were due as a result of the settlement.\nAs of December 31, 2021, other than adjustments resulting from the federal and state income tax audits discussed herein, the various state and local tax jurisdictions in which the Company files tax returns can no longer assess tax with respect to years ended prior to 2016. However, such state and local tax jurisdictions may adjust NOLs generated in such years that are utilized in subsequent years. During 2021, an examination of income tax returns filed in New Jersey for tax years 2015 through 2018 closed with no change and an examination of income tax returns filed in Massachusetts for tax years 2017 and 2018 closed with no material adjustments. Additionally, the Company's income tax returns filed in New York City for the tax years 2017 through 2019 are currently under examination. The Company does not anticipate any material adjustments upon resolution of this audit.\nThe Company received a final audit determination with respect to the examination of income tax returns filed in the state of Michigan for tax years 2014 through 2018. The Company had an informal conference with the Michigan Department of Treasury Hearings Division to contest the findings of the audit. The Hearings Division issued its decision and order and now the Company is determining its next course of action. Any final adjustments upon resolution of this matter are not expected to be material.\nThe Company believes that it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021 may decrease by up to $\n13\nmillion within the next twelve months on the expectation of resolution of a tax accounting method related to its customer loyalty program.\nNOTE 11 –\nLEASES\nThe Company leases the land underlying certain of its properties, real estate, and various equipment under operating and, to a lesser extent, finance lease arrangements.

In addition, MGM China leases transportation equipment and office space from Shun Tak. MGM China incurred expenses relating to Shun Tak of $\n7\nmillion, $\n7\nmillion and $\n16\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition, Ms. Ho indirectly holds a\n50\n% interest in an entity th\nat\nprovides, along with its subsidiary, marketing and public relations consulting services, including for the retendering of MGM China's gaming subconcession, to MGM China, which totaled $\n4\nmillion\n, $\n1\nmillion, and $\n4\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nGrand Paradise Macau deferred cash payment.\nOn September 1, 2016, the Company purchased\n188.1\nmillion common shares of its MGM China subsidiary from Grand Paradise Macau (“GPM”), an entity controlled by Ms. Ho. As\n103\npart of the consideration for the purchase, the Company agreed to pay GPM or its nominee a deferred cash payment of $\n50\nmillion. The payments included amounts equal to the ordinary dividends received on such shares, with a final lump sum payment due on the fifth anniversary of the closing date of the transaction, which was made in September 2021. Such amounts were paid to Expert Angels Limited, an entity controlled by an immediate family member of Ms. Ho.

The MGP master lease provides that any extension of its term must apply to all of the real estate under the master lease at the time of the extension. The MGP master lease provides that the initial term with respect to MGM National Harbor ends on April 31, 2024. Thereafter, the initial term of the MGP master lease with respect to MGM National Harbor may be renewed at the option of the Company for an initial renewal period lasting until the earlier of the end of the then-current term of the master lease or the next renewal term (depending on whether the Company elects to renew the other properties under the master lease in connection with the expiration of the initial\n10\n-year term). If, however, the Company chooses not to renew the lease with respect to MGM National Harbor after the initial MGM National Harbor term under the master lease, the Company would also lose the right to renew the MGP master lease with respect to the rest of the properties when the initial\n10\n-year lease term ends related to the rest of the properties in 2026. In addition to the four\n5\n-year renewal terms, the term of the lease with respect to MGM Springfield may be extended for an additional four\n5\n-year renewal terms. The MGP master lease has a triple-net structure, which requires the Company to pay substantially all costs associated with the lease, including real estate taxes, ground lease payments, insurance, utilities and routine maintenance, in addition to the base rent. Additionally, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer with respect to any further gaming development by the Company on the undeveloped land adjacent to Empire City, which MGP may exercise should the Company elect to sell this property in the future.\nRent under the MGP master lease consists of a base rent component and a percentage rent component. As of December 31, 2021, the base rent represents approximately\n91\n% of the rent payments due and the percentage rent represents approximately\n9\n% of the rent payments due under the MGP master lease. The MGP master lease also provides for fixed annual escalators of\n2\n% on the base rent through the sixth lease year and the possibility for additional\n2\n% increases thereafter subject to the tenant and operating subsidiary sublessee, collectively, meeting an adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as well as potential increases in percentage rent in year six and every\nfive years\nthereafter based on a percentage of average actual annual net revenue during the preceding five year period calculated in accordance with the terms under the master lease. With respect to the additional renewal terms for MGM Springfield, for the first two additional renewal terms, base rent will include a fixed annual rent escalator of\n2.0\n%, subject to the adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as discussed above. For each lease year subsequent to the first two additional renewal terms, the base rent shall be the Fair Market Rent (as defined in the MGP master lease) in respect of MGM Springfield. The MGP master lease also contains customary events of default and financial covenants; provided that the tenant will not be in default of the financial covenants in the event there is an unavoidable delay (as such term is defined in the lease). The Company was in compliance with all applicable covenants as of December 31, 2021.\nSubsequent to the Company completing its acquisition of Empire City in January 2019, MGP acquired the developed real property associated with Empire City from the Company for consideration of approximately $\n634\nmillion, which included the assumption of debt of approximately $\n246\nmillion, which was immediately repaid, and the remainder in issuance of Operating Partnership units. The real estate assets of Empire City were then leased to the Company pursuant to an amendment to the MGP master lease, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by $\n50\nmillion, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the MGP master lease terms,\n90\n% of this rent will be fixed and contractually\n104\ngrow at\n2\n% per year until 2022. As disclosed above, the master lease provides MGP with a right of first offer with respect to certain undeveloped land adjacent to the property to the extent the Company develops additional gaming facilities, which MGP may exercise should the Company elect to sell this property in the future.\nOn March 7, 2019, the Company entered into an amendment to the existing MGP master lease with respect to the Park MGM Transaction. In connection with the transaction, the Company received consideration of\n$\n638\nmillion\n, of which approximately\n$\n606\nmillion\nwas paid in cash and the remainder in issuance of Operating Partnership units. Additionally, the annual rent payment to MGP was increased by\n$\n50\nmillion\n, prorated for the remainder of the lease year. Consistent with the master lease terms,\n90\n%\nof this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at\n2\n%\nper year until 2022.\nAdditionally, on April 1, 2019, the Company acquired the membership interests of Northfield from MGP, which held the operations of Northfield, for fair value of consideration of approximately\n$\n305\nmillion\nconsisting primarily of approximately\n9\nmillion\nOperating Partnership units that were ultimately redeemed by the Operating Partnership, and MGP retained the associated real estate assets. The Company then rebranded the property to MGM Northfield Park, which was then added to the existing MGP master lease with MGP, increasing the annual rent payment to MGP by\n$\n60\nmillion\n. Consistent with the master lease terms,\n90\n%\nof this rent will be fixed and contractually grow at\n2\n%\nper year until 2022.\nThe annual rent payments under the MGP master lease for the fourth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2019, increased to $\n946\nmillion from $\n770\nmillion at the start of the third lease year. The increase was a result of the $\n50\nmillion in additional rent for each of the Park MGM Transaction and the addition of Empire City in the beginning of 2019, the $\n60\nmillion of additional rent for MGM Northfield Park, which entered the Master Lease on April 1, 2019, as well as the third\n2\n% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2019.\nOn February 14, 2020, the Company amended the MGP master lease to remove Mandalay Bay from such master lease and the annual rent under the MGP master lease was reduced by $\n133\nmillion to $\n813\nmillion.\nThe annual cash rent payments under the MGP master lease for the fifth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2020, increased to $\n828\nmillion from $\n813\nmillion, as a result of the fourth\n2\n% fixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2020.\nThe annual cash rent payments under the MGP master lease for the sixth lease year, which commenced on April 1, 2021, increased to\n$\n843\nmillion\nfrom\n$\n828\nmillion\n, as a result of the fifth\n2\n%\nfixed annual rent escalator that went into effect on April 1, 2021.\nIn October 2021, MGP acquired the real estate assets of MGM Springfield from the Company for $\n400\nmillion of cash consideration, which was accounted for as a transaction between entities under common control. The Company adjusted the carrying value of noncontrolling interests to adjust for its share of the difference between the carrying value of the net assets transferred and the consideration received, with offsetting adjustments to capital in excess of par value. MGM Springfield was added to the master lease between the Company and MGP. Following the closing of the transaction, the annual rent payment to MGP increased from\n$\n843\nmillion\nto $\n873\nmillion, reflecting the addition of MGM Springfield, which increased the annual rent payment by $\n30\nmillion, $\n27\nmillion of which will be fixed and contractually grow at\n2\n% per year with escalators subject to the adjusted net revenue to rent ratio, as further described above. Final regulatory approvals, which were not necessary for the transaction to close, are expected to be received within nine to twelve months following the close of the transaction. Until final regulatory approvals are obtained, the parties will be subject to a trust agreement, which provides for the property to go into a trust (or, at the Company’s option, be returned to the Company) during the interim period in the event that the regulator finds reasonable cause to believe that MGP may not be found suitable. The property will then remain in trust until a final determination regarding MGP’s suitability is made.\nAdditionally, refer to Note 1 for discussion relating to the waiver agreement with MGP and the Operating Partnership units redeemed in 2020 thereunder.\nAll intercompany transactions, including transactions under the MGP master lease, have been eliminated in the Company’s consolidation of MGP. The public ownership of MGP’s Class A shares is recognized as noncontrolling interests in the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAs further described in Note 1, in August 2021, the Company entered into an agreement with VICI and MGP whereby VICI will acquire MGP in a stock-for-stock transaction. As part of the transaction, the Company will enter into an amended and restated master lease with VICI. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2022, subject to customary closing conditions, regulatory approvals, and approval by VICI stockholders (which was obtained on October 29, 2021).\n105\nBellagio BREIT Venture\nThe Company has a\n5\n% ownership interest in Bellagio BREIT Venture, which owns the real estate assets of Bellagio and leases such assets to a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to a lease agreement. Refer to Note 11 for further information related to the Bellagio lease.\nMGP BREIT Venture\nMGP has a\n50.1\n% ownership interest in MGP BREIT Venture, which owns the real estate assets of Mandalay Bay and MGM Grand Las Vegas and leases such assets to a subsidiary of the Company pursuant to a lease agreement.
