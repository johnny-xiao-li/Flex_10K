    "text": "The following is a discussion and analysis of our financial position as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and results of operations and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021. This commentary should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto appearing under “Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.”\nExecutive Overview\nOur Business\nMotorola Solutions is a global leader in mission-critical communications and analytics. Our technologies in Land Mobile Radio Communications (\"LMR\" or \"LMR Communications\"), Video Security and Access Control and Command Center Software, bolstered by managed and support services, make communities safer and help businesses stay productive and secure. We serve more than 100,000 public safety and commercial customers in over 100 countries, providing “purpose-built” solutions designed for their unique needs, and we have a rich heritage of innovation focusing on advancing global safety for more than 90 years.\nWe manage our business organizationally through two segments: “Products and Systems Integration” and “Software and Services.” Within these segments, the Company has principal product lines that also follow our three major technologies: LMR Communications, Video Security and Access Control and Command Center Software. In January 2022 we renamed one of our three major products and services technologies from LMR Mission Critical Communications to LMR Communications in an effort to more succinctly brand our LMR technology.  This change was to the name of the technology only and no financial information was reclassified from previous periods.\nThe Company has invested across these three technologies, evolving the Company’s LMR focus to purposefully integrate software, video security and access control solutions for public safety and enterprise customers globally.\nOur strategy is to generate value through the integration of each technology into our ecosystem, uniting voice, software, video security, access control and analytics to interoperate. While each technology individually strives to make users safer and more productive, we believe we can enable better outcomes for individuals, businesses and agencies when we unite these technologies as one connected system. With our technology ecosystem, our goal is to help remove silos between systems, unify data, streamline workflows, simplify management and support evolving technologies. Across all three technologies, we offer cloud-based solutions, cybersecurity services and managed and support services.\nAn example of our integrated technology ecosystem in action is when our municipal governmental agency customers leverage communications, video security, analytics and cloud-based software to understand what is happening across their cities, which we believe helps to improve community collaboration and overall safety. Video Security and Access Control solutions help users identify and understand events, find lost people and protect property. Command Center Software informs and assists emergency response by unifying data across the 911 workflow, including call handling, dispatch, video analytics, field reporting, records, evidence and community input. Voice and data communications connect law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services from different agencies and jurisdictions in an effort to improve coordination and collaboration. The end-to-end integration of these technologies assists agencies in detecting, analyzing, communicating and responding to incidents.\nThe principal products within each segment, by technology, are described below:\nProducts and Systems Integration Segment\nIn 2021, the segment’s net sales were $5.0 billion, representing 62% of our consolidated net sales.\nLMR Communications\nOur LMR Communications technology includes infrastructure and devices for LMR, public safety Long Term Evolution (“LTE”) and enterprise-grade private LTE. We are a global leader in the two-way radio category, including Project 25 (“P25”), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (“TETRA”) and Digital Mobile Radio (“DMR”), as well as other PCR solutions. We also deliver LTE solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including infrastructure and devices operating in 700 MHz, 900 MHz and Citizens’ Broadband Radio Service (“CBRS”) frequencies. Primary sources of revenue for this technology come from selling devices and building telecommunications networks, including infrastructure, installation and integration with our customers’ technology environments.\nOur technology enables voice and multimedia collaborations across different two-way radio, WiFi or public LTE and private broadband networks. We believe that first responders continue to trust LMR communications because they are purpose-built and designed for reliability, availability, security and resiliency to withstand the most challenging conditions. By adding broadband data capabilities to our two-way radios, we strive to provide our customers with greater functionality and multimedia access to the information and data they need in their workflows. Examples include application services such as GPS location to better protect lone workers, job dispatch to share information and over-the-air programming to optimize device uptime.\nThe LMR technology within the Products and Systems Integration segment represent\ned 84%\nof the net sales of the total segment in 2021.\n29\nVideo Security and Access Control\nOur Video Security and Access Control technology includes video management infrastructure, AI-powered security cameras including fixed and mobile (body-worn and in-vehicle) and access control solutions. We deploy video security and access control solutions to thousands of government and commercial customers around the world including school campuses, transportation systems, healthcare centers, public venues, utilities, prisons, factories, casinos, airports, financial institutions, government facilities, state and local law enforcement agencies and retailers. Organizations such as these utilize video security and access control to enable continuous monitoring that can improve situational awareness, verify critical events or incidents in real-time and provide data to investigate an event or incident after it happens.\nOur view is that government and public safety customers in particular are increasingly turning to video security technologies, including fixed street cameras, in-vehicle cameras and body-worn cameras, to increase visibility, accountability and safety for citizens, communities and first responders alike. Additionally, our view is that government, public safety agencies and businesses are increasingly turning to scalable, cloud-based multi-factor authentication access control to make their facilities more secure.\nSince 2018, we have developed our video security and access control business through investments in research and development and through acquisitions, directly contributing to our growth strategy to serve as a leader in end-to-end video security solutions. These activities have supported the expansion of our portfolio, which started with fixed video, access control and AI-enabled analytics solutions and has evolved to include mobile video (body-worn and in-vehicle cameras) for both public safety and commercial markets, a broader range of fixed video security technologies, business analytics and cloud-based access control solutions.\nSoftware\nand Services Segment\nIn 2021, the segment’s net sales were $3.1 billion, representing 38% of our consolidated net sales.\nLMR Communications\nLMR Communications services include support and managed services, which offer a broad continuum of support for our customers. Support services include repair and replacement, technical support and preventative maintenance, and more advanced offerings such as system monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed services range from partial to full operational support of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned networks. Our customers’ systems often have multi-year or multi-decade lifespans that help drive demand for software upgrades, device and infrastructure refresh opportunities, as well as additional services to monitor, manage, maintain and secure these complex networks and solutions. We strive to deliver services to our customers that help improve performance across their systems, devices and applications for greater safety and productivity.\nGiven the mission-critical nature of our customers’ operational environments, we aim to design the LMR networks they rely on for availability, security and resiliency, as well as to keep pace with technological advancements. We have a comprehensive approach to system upgrades that addresses hardware, software and implementation services. As new system releases become available, we work with our customers to upgrade software, hardware, or both, with respect to site controllers, comparators, routers, LAN switches, servers, dispatch consoles, logging equipment, network management terminals, network security devices such as firewalls and intrusion detection sensors, and more, on-site or remotely.\nThe LMR technology within the Software and Services segment represente\nd 70% o\nf the net sales of the total segment in 2021.\nVideo Security and Access Control\nVideo Security and Access Control software includes video management software, decision and digital evidence management software and advanced vehicle location data analysis software, including license plate recognition. Our software is designed to complement video hardware systems, serving as an ecosystem that provides end-to-end video security to strive to keep people, property and assets safe.\nOur video network management software is embedded with artificial intelligence (“AI”)-enabled analytics to deliver operational insights to our customers by bringing attention to important events within their video footage. Given the volume of video footage, we believe this is critical to monitor and manage to deliver meaningful, action-oriented insights.\nFor example, AI-enabled analytics can detect unusual behavior such as a person at a facility out of hours, locate a missing child at a theme park with Appearance Search, flag a denylisted vehicle at a school through license plate recognition, or send an alert through access control if doors are propped open at a hospital.\nVideo Security and Access Control services include our video-as-a-service offering for law enforcement, simplifying procurement by bundling hardware and software into a single subscription. Body-worn cameras and in-car video systems can be paired with either on-premises or cloud-based digital evidence management software and complementary command center software products. Additionally, Avigilon fixed video systems connected to Avigilon Cloud Services (“ACS”) provide our customers with the ability to securely access video across their sites from a remote central monitoring location and more easily integrate with their other systems.\nThe Video Security and Access Control technology within the Software and Services segment represente\nd\n13% of the net sales of the total segment in 2021.\n30\nCommand Center Software\nOur Command Center Software suite, CommandCentral, consists of native cloud and on-premises solutions that support the complex process of the public safety workflow from \"911 call to case closure.\" The moment a citizen dials 911, an array of roles are involved in coordinating response and post-incident management, such as dispatchers who route calls to police, fire and emergency medical services, first responders in the field, intelligence analysts who manage real-time operations, records specialists who preserve the integrity of information and evidence, crime analysts who identify patterns and accelerate investigations, and corrections officers who oversee jail and inmate management.\nCommandCentral software supports these roles through the three phases of incident response: incident awareness, incident management and post-incident resolution. Incident awareness software includes community engagement applications for tip submissions, crime mapping and evidence submission, and 911 call-handling software (including multimedia) and next-generation core services for 911 call routing. Incident management software includes computer aided dispatch (“CAD”) for dispatch and coordinating first response, situational awareness software that shows a single, real-time view of video feeds and other alerts on a map, and field response and reporting to help frontline personnel collaborate, manage incident activity and file reports from the field. Post-incident resolution software includes centralized records and evidence management for record-keeping and judicial sharing, analytics including license plate recognition, and jail and inmate management to streamline the process and enable secure inter-agency information sharing.\nAs the public safety market continues to evolve toward software offerings that more efficiently run their operations, reduce response times and increase officer availability, we have focused on providing cloud-based software-as-a service (“SaaS”) with ancillary implementation and managed services in addition to on-premises solutions. Our CommandCentral suite, hosted in Microsoft Azure Government, includes call handling, CAD, field reporting, records, evidence, investigations and jail in an integrated cloud-based offering. We believe that cloud deployment delivers agencies key benefits, including faster deployment, increased security, rapid scaling in the event of an emergency and a secure investment that keeps pace as technology advances. In addition to this native cloud suite, we offer a hybrid solution that delivers a migration path from on-premises software solutions to cloud-connected capabilities.\nAnother area of public safety evolution is increasing adoption of Next Generation 911 Core Services (“NGCS”), a group of products and services needed to create infrastructure connectivity in order to process a 911 call using Next Generation (“NG”) technology. The NG infrastructure is an Emergency Service IP Network (\"ESInet\"), which can carry voice, data and multimedia. ESInet enables 911 call takers at public safety answering points to respond to text, video and data. Our NGCS can be offered as a managed service and includes call routing, ESInet, location services, Geographic Information Services, cybersecurity and our continuous network and security operations center dedicated to public safety. We believe that our solution is differentiated through its integration with our CommandCentral software suite to simplify the agency’s workflow and ensure better incident management and real-time intelligence.\nAdditional Command Center Software includes interoperability software that ensures communication is not limited by coverage area, network technology or device type. Our solutions, including Kodiak, WAVE PTX and CriticalConnect, enable interoperability among devices across multiple networks. For example, a two-way radio network can connect with an LTE network making it possible for individuals to communicate securely and more easily across technologies.\nThe Command Center Software technology within the Software and Services segment represented\n17%\nof the net sales of the total segment in 2021.\n2021 Financial Results\n•\nNet sales were $8.2 billion in 2021 compared to $7.4 billion in 2020.\n•\nOperating earnings were $1.7 billion in 2021 compared to $1.4 billion in 2020.\n•\nNet earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. were $1.2 billion, or $7.17 per diluted common share in 2021, compared to earnings of $949 million, or $5.45 per diluted common share in 2020.\n•\nOur operating cash flow was $1.8 billion in 2021 compared to $1.6 billion in 2020.\n•\nWe returned over $1.0 billion of capital to shareholders, in the form of $528 million in share repurchases and $482 million in dividends in 2021.\n•\nWe increased our quarterly dividend by 11% to $0.79 per share in November 2021.\n•\nWe ended 2021 with a backlog position of $13.6 billion, up $2.2 billion compared to 2020.\n31\nSegment Financial Highlights\n•\nIn the Products and Systems Integration segment, net sales were $5.0 billion in 2021, an increase of $399 million, or 9%, compared to $4.6 billion in 2020. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in both the North America region and the International regions. Operating earnings were $760 million in 2021, compared to $656 million in 2020. Operating margins increased in 2021 to 15.1% from 14.2% in 2020 primarily due to increased sales volume, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by a $50 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment in 2020 that did not recur in 2021, higher employee incentive costs and higher expenses associated with acquired businesses. The overall increase in operating expenses was partially offset by $43 million lower reorganization of business charges and $16 million lower Hytera-related legal expenses.\n•\nIn the Software and Services segment, net sales were $3.1 billion in 2021, an increase of $358 million, or 13%, compared to $2.8 billion in 2020. On a geographic basis, net sales increased in both the North America and International regions. Operating earnings were $907 million in 2021, compared to $727 million in 2020. Operating margin increased in 2021 to 28.9% from 26.2% in 2020 due to higher sales and gross margin contribution, partially offset by higher operating expenses driven by expenses associated with acquired businesses, higher employee incentive costs and higher intangible assets amortization expense. The overall increase in operating expenses was partially offset by $11 million lower reorganization of business expenses and $7 million lower share-based compensation expenses.\nCOVID-19\nIn response to the COVID-19 pandemic, there have been a broad number of governmental and commercial actions taken to limit the spread of the virus, including social distancing measures, stay-at-home orders, travel restrictions, business shutdowns and slowdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic continues to be dynamic, and near-term challenges across the economy remain. Although vaccines are now being distributed and administered across many parts of the world, new variants of the virus have emerged and may continue to emerge that have continued to create uncertainty regarding the impact of COVID-19. In particular, the recent acceleration of the \"omicron variant\" of the virus and the highly contagious “delta variant” of the virus have caused recent surges of COVID-19 cases in the U.S. and other countries around the world. We continue to adhere to applicable governmental and commercial restrictions and to work to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on our employees, customers, communities, liquidity and financial position.\nWe continue to abide by a number of measures in an effort to protect the health and well-being of our employees and customers, including encouraging office workers to work remotely, reducing employee travel, withdrawing from certain industry events, increasing the frequency of cleaning services, encouraging face coverings, and using thermal scanning. We have allowed essential business travel; however, we continue to carefully assess conditions on a geographical basis to determine when employees can safely return to our offices. We also facilitated the process for our employees in certain locations to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, as vaccines are distributed and administered throughout the U.S. and the global community.\nAs conditions continue to fluctuate around the world, with both vaccine administration and the rates of new variants of COVID-19 (particularly the omicron and delta variants) rising in certain regions, governments and organizations have responded by adjusting their restrictions and guidelines accordingly. The health and safety of our employees remains our top priority, and we continue to monitor the daily evolution of the pandemic, including the spread of the omicron and delta variants. As of the date of this filing, we are following the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance and state and local restrictions with respect to our U.S. employees, as well as guidance from corresponding international authorities with respect to our non-U.S. employees.\nAdditionally, in September 2021, the President of the United States signed a series of executive orders, and related guidance was issued that, together, required certain employers to implement COVID-19 precautions, including mandatory COVID-19 vaccines for employees (subject to medical and religious exemptions). As a federal contractor, we were required to implement a mandatory vaccine policy. In January 2022, in response to various legal challenges to these orders, we suspended our requirement that our U.S. employees (subject to the exemptions described above) be vaccinated by February 9, 2022. We continue to evaluate our internal policy and the potential impact of the executive orders and legal responses to such executive orders on our business.\nAs we progressed through 2021, our supply chain has been increasingly impacted by global issues related to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, particularly with respect to materials in the semiconductor market, including part shortages, increased freight costs, diminished transportation capacity and labor constraints. This has resulted in disruptions in our supply chain, as well as difficulties and delays in procuring certain semiconductor components. During the latter part of the fourth quarter of 2021, costs increased driven by delivery delays and the need to purchase semiconductor components from alternative sources, including brokers. We anticipate increased costs to procure materials within the semiconductor market to continue into the first half of 2022.  We are closely monitoring our supply chain and have maintained an active dialogue, and in some cases developed plans, with key suppliers in an effort to mitigate supply chain risks or otherwise minimize the impact from those risks. We will continue to actively manage our supply chain in an effort to prevent major delays in selling our products and services.\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic continued to introduce challenges throughout 2021, we are encouraged by customer demand for our products and services. Specifically, in our Software and Services segment, with the largely recurring nature of the business and our strong backlog position, we continue to expect that the impacts on net sales and operating margin will be limited throughout 2022. Within the Products and Systems Integration segment, while we are encouraged by strong LMR backlog and the resiliency of the Video Security and Access Control technology that experienced growth in 2021, supply constraints continue to impact our LMR business and we expect demand for our products will continue to out-pace our ability to obtain\n32\nsupply throughout 2022. In addition, in March 2021, the President of the United States signed into law the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (\"ARPA\"), which is intended to provide economic stimulus, specifically additional funding to state and local governments, education and healthcare, as well as other funding relief provisions, in order to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We experienced the positive impact of the ARPA funding on our business and results of operations during 2021 and anticipate that the ARPA will continue to have a positive impact throughout 2022.\nWe believe our existing balances of cash and cash equivalents, along with other short-term liquidity arrangements, will continue to be sufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements associated with our existing operations. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the 2021 unsecured revolving credit facility as of December 31, 2021. Additionally, we have no bond maturities until 2024. We continue to assess our operating expenses and identify cost-reducing initiatives, including lower travel costs, contractor spend and reducing our real estate footprint.\nLastly, we evaluated whether there were any impairment indicators as of December 31, 2021, which included a review of our receivables and contract assets, inventory, right-of-use lease assets, long-lived assets, investments, goodwill and intangible assets. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2021, we concluded our assets were fairly stated and recoverable.\nFor further information, please see “Part I. Item 1. Business” and “Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors” in this Form 10-K. The Company’s current expectations described above are forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ.\nRecent Acquisitions\n33\nClimate Change\nWe expect that our operations and supply chain will become increasingly subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations and international treaties and industry standards relating to climate change. For example, in October 2021 the U.K.’s Cabinet Office began requiring companies bidding on contracts with the U.K. government that have a value of over £5m per year to have carbon reduction plans that contain a commitment to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 for U.K. operations. This requirement applies to our operations in the U.K. Although Motorola Solutions  UK Ltd. and Airwave Solutions Ltd., our U.K. subsidiaries, each committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 for such entities' U.K. operations, this requirement and any similar future requirements and other increased regulation of climate change concerns could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, impact our competitive position or require us to make certain changes to our manufacturing practices and/or product designs.\nLooking Forward\nWe expect continued growth within our global LMR installed base as a number of events such as natural disasters and large-scale incidents continue to reinforce the importance of having secure, reliable LMR for public safety. We believe our augmentation of LMR with broadband solutions will also drive growth, as we expect our customers will look to integrate valuable data capabilities. We expect to provide additional services to existing LMR customers as communication networks become more complex, software-centric and data-driven.\nAs public safety needs continue to evolve, we anticipate growth opportunities within the command center as our Command Center Software suite covers the mission-critical workflow, from 911 intake to case closure and management. We expect increased growth in our integrated software next generation core services and our cloud-based solutions, such as the PremierOne Cloud suite, as well as hybrid cloud solutions that provide a migration path from on-premises software solutions to cloud-connected capabilities.\nWithin Video Security and Access Control, we expect growth across our portfolio of fixed and mobile security solutions embedded with advanced analytics and access control solutions. We believe drivers include expansion of traditional video sales beyond commercial customers to government and public safety customers. Additionally, we expect customers to continue to embrace analytics that convert video into data and the scalability of the cloud to run their operations, and we also expect continued expansion of offerings such as video-as-a-service and Avigilon Cloud Services.\nFinally, we anticipate new opportunities from the investments we are making to integrate our LMR, Video Security and Access Control and Command Center Software technologies into one unified ecosystem. We have made go-to-market and research and development investments in both Video Security and Access Control and our Command Center Software technologies with growth in mind. We have made a number of acquisitions and we see opportunities to continue to rationalize costs within both segments of our business, further driving operating leverage in our businesses. We believe our integrated ecosystem for public and enterprise safety can enable strong collaboration by removing system silos, simplifying management and automating workflows.\nWe expect our growth within LMR may be limited by supply in 2022. Refer to “COVID-19” set forth in this “Part II. Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” of this Form 10-K for a further discussion of our outlook with respect to the continuing impact of COVID-19 on our financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\n34\nResults of Operations\n*    Amounts attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. common shareholders.\n**    Percentages may not add due to rounding.\nGeographic Market Sales by Locale of End Customer\n35\nResults of Operations—2021 Compared to 2020\nNet Sales\nThe Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 62% of our net sales in 2021, compared to 63% in 2020.

Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information);\n•\n$3 million of legal settlements in 2021 compared to $9 million in 2020; and\n•\n$5 million of fixed asset impairments in 2020 that did not recur in 2021.\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings increased $284 million, or 21% in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase in Operating earnings was due to:\n37\n•\nSoftware and Services segment increased $180 million from 2020 to 2021 driven by higher sales and gross margin contribution and an improved mix of service offerings, offset by higher operating expenses.  The increase in operating expenses was driven by higher expenses associated with acquired businesses, higher employee incentive costs and higher intangible assets amortization expense, partially offset by $11 million lower reorganization of business expenses and $7 million lower share-based compensation expenses; and\n•\nProducts and Systems Integration increased $104 million from 2020 to 2021 primarily driven by increased sales volume, partially offset by higher operating expenses.  The increase in operating expenses was driven by a $50 million gain on the sale of property, plant and equipment in 2020 that did not recur in 2021, higher employee incentive costs and higher expenses associated with acquired businesses, partially offset by: $43 million lower reorganization of business charges and $16 million lower Hytera-related legal expenses.\nInterest Expense, net\nThe $12 million decrease in net interest expense in 2021 compared to 2020 was a result of the reversal of an $11 million non-cash interest accrual related to an international tax audit and lower interest rates on debt outstanding.\nGains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net\nThe net gains (losses) on sales of investments and businesses were primarily related to the sales of various equity investments.\nOther, net\nNet Other income increased $79 million in 2021 compared to 2020 primarily due to:\n•\n$17 million of foreign currency gains in 2021 compared to $44 million of foreign currency losses in 2020;\n•\n$123 million of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits in 2021 compared to $81 million of net periodic pension and postretirement benefits in 2020;\n•\nan $18 million loss on the extinguishment of long term debt in 2021 compared to a $56 million loss on the extinguishment of long-term debt in 2020 (see \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information); and\n•\n$4 million of investment impairments in 2020 that did not occur in 2021; partially offset by\n•\n$30 million loss on derivatives in 2021 compared to a $25 million gain on derivatives in 2020; and\n•\nan $8 million loss on fair value adjustments to equity investments in 2021 compared to a $6 million gain on fair value adjustments to equity investments in 2020.\nEffective Tax Rate\nIncome tax expense increased by $81 million in 2021 compared to 2020, for an effective tax rate of 19.5%, which is lower than the current U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to:\n•\na $34 million benefit due to a change in the Company's ability to utilize tax attribute carryforwards resulting in the partial release of valuation allowances (see \"Note 7:  Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information); and\n38\n•\n$32 million of benefits due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.\nOur effective tax rate in 2020 was 18.8%, which is lower than the current U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to:\n•\n$48 million of benefits due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation; and\n•\n$28 million of benefits due to the recognition of increased prior and current R&D tax credits.\nResults of Operations—2020 Compared to 2019\nNet Sales\nThe Products and Systems Integration segment’s net sales represented 63% of our net sales in 2020, compared to 68% in 2019. The Software and Services segment’s net sales represented 37% of our net sales in 2020, compared to 32% in 2019.\nNet sales decreased by $473 million, or 6% in 2020 compared to 2019. The 13% decline in net sales within the Products and Systems Integration segment was driven by an 11% decline in the North America region and an 18% decline in the International region. The 9% increase in the Software and Services segment was driven by a 12% increase in the North America region and a 4% increase in the International region. The decrease in net sales included:\n•\na decline in the Products and Systems Integration segment, inclusive of $119 million of revenue from acquisitions, driven by a decline in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in Video Security;\n•\ngrowth in the Software and Services segment, inclusive of $84 million of revenue from acquisitions, driven by an increase in Video Security and Access Control, Command Center Software, and LMR services due to strong demand in the North America region; and\n•\n$12 million from unfavorable currency rates.\nRegional results include:\n•\na 5% decline in the North America region, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, driven by declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in Video Security and Access Control, LMR services, and Command Center Software; and\n•\na 9% decline in the International region, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, driven by declines in public safety LMR and PCR, partially offset by growth in Video Security and Access Control, Command Center Software, and LMR public safety services.\nProducts and Systems Integration\nThe 13% decrease in the Products and Systems Integration segment was driven by the following:\n•\n$838 million, or 17% decline in public safety LMR and PCR, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, in both the International and North America regions, primarily driven by a delay in customer engagement due to the COVID-19 pandemic; partially offset by\n•\n$143 million, or 29% growth in Video Security and Access Control, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, in both the International and North America regions; and\n•\n$3 million from favorable currency rates.\nSoftware and Services\nThe 9% increase in the Software and Services segment was driven by the following:\n•\n$117 million, or 6% growth in LMR services, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, driven by the North America region;\n•\n$75 million, or 36% growth in Video Security and Access Control, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, driven by both the North America and International regions; and\n•\n$30 million, or 7% growth in Command Center Software, inclusive of revenue from acquisitions, driven by both the North America and International regions; partially offset by\n•\n$15 million from unfavorable currency rates.\n39\nGross Margin\nGross margin was 48.7% of net sales in 2020 and 49.8% of net sales in 2019. The $323 million decrease was driven by:\n•\nlower gross margin contribution in the Products and Systems Integration segment as a result of the decline in public safety LMR and PCR sales, as well as lower margins on projects driven by a delay in engagements from COVID-19, partially offset by lower incentive costs; partially offset by\n•\nhigher gross margins within the Software and Services segment, inclusive of acquisitions, primarily driven by higher gross margin contribution from sales growth, driven by improved mix of service offerings and lower travel and incentive costs.\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\nSG&A expenses decreased $110 million, or 8% in 2020 compared to 2019. SG&A expenses were 17.4% of net sales in 2020 compared to 17.8% of net sales in 2019. The decrease in SG&A expenses was primarily due to reduced employee incentive costs, travel expenses, and indirect expenses. The overall reduction in SG&A expenses was partially offset by expenses associated with acquired businesses.\nResearch and Development Expenditures\nR&D expenditures remained consistent in 2020 compared to 2019. R&D expenditures were 9.3% of net sales in 2020 and 8.7% of net sales in 2019.\nOther Charges\nOther charges decreased by $14 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to the following:\n•\n$50 million gain on sale of a manufacturing facility in Europe in 2020; partially offset by\n•\n$57 million of net reorganization of business charges in 2020 as compared to $40 million in 2019 (see \"Note 14: Reorganization of Businesses\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information);\n•\n$215 million of amortization of intangibles in 2020 compared to $208 million in 2019;\n•\n$9 million of legal settlements in 2020 compared to $3 million in 2019;\n•\n$9 million of charges for acquisition-related transaction fees in 2020 as compared to $3 million in 2019; and\n•\n$5 million of fixed asset impairments.\n40\nOperating Earnings\nOperating earnings decreased $198 million, or 13% in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease in Operating earnings was due to:\n•\nProducts and Systems Integration decreased by $338 million from 2020 to 2019 driven by lower sales and gross margin contribution, partially offset by lower operating expenses driven by lower employee incentive costs, indirect expenses, and travel expenses. The overall reduction in operating expenses was offset by: $23 million higher reorganization of business expenses, $11 million higher share-based compensation expenses and higher operating expenses from acquisitions.\n•\nSoftware and Services segment increased by $140 million from 2020 to 2019 driven by higher sales and gross margin contribution, along with reduced operating expenses due to operating leverage, inclusive of lower employee incentive costs and travel expenses. The overall reduction in operating expenses was partially offset by: $6 million higher reorganization of business expenses, $5 million higher intangible amortization driven by acquisitions and higher operating expenses from acquisitions.\nInterest Expense, net\nInterest expense, net in 2020 compared to 2019 remained relatively consistent due to a one-time receipt of interest income related to a tax refund and lower interest rates on debt outstanding, offset by lower interest income earned on cash due to lower interest rates.\nGains (losses) on Sales of Investments and Businesses, net\nThe net gains (losses) in 2020 and 2019 were primarily related to the sales of various equity investments.\nOther, net\nNet Other income (Loss) increased $378 million in 2020 compared to 2019 primarily due to:\n•\n$359 million U.S pension settlement loss in 2019 (see \"Note 8: Retirement Benefits\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information);\n•\n$25 million gain on derivatives in 2020 compared to an $8 million loss on derivatives in 2019;\n•\n$4 million of investment impairments in 2020 compared to $18 million in 2019; partially offset by\n•\n$44 million of foreign currency losses in 2020 compared to $22 million in 2019; and\n•\n$56 million of net losses from repurchases of long term debt in 2020 as compared to a loss of $46 million in 2019 (see \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information).\n41\nEffective Tax Rate\nIncome tax expense increased by $91 million in 2020 compared to 2019, for an effective tax rate of 18.8%, which is lower than the current U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to:\n•\n$48 million of benefits due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation; and\n•\n$28 million of benefits due to the recognition of increased prior and current R&D tax credits.\nOur effective tax rate in 2019 was 13.0%, which is lower than the current U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily related to:\n•\na $77 million benefit due to the partial release of a valuation allowance to our U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward (see \"Note 7: Income Taxes\" to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for further information); and\n•\n$27 million of benefits due to the recognition of excess tax benefits on share-based compensation.\nReorganization of Businesses\nIn 2021, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $32 million relating to the separation of 600 employees, of which 200 were indirect employees and 400 were direct employees. The $32 million of charges included $8 million recorded to Cost of sales and $24 million recorded to Other charges. Included in the aggregate $32 million are charges of $42 million for employee separation costs partially offset by $10 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.\nDuring 2020, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $86 million relating to the separation of 1,200 employees, of which 400 were indirect employees and 800 were direct employees. The $86 million of charges included $29 million recorded to Cost of sales and $57 million recorded to Other charges. Included in the aggregate $86 million were charges of $100 million for employee separation costs and $2 million for exit costs, partially offset by $16 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.\nDuring 2019, we recorded net reorganization of business charges of $57 million relating to the separation of 700 employees, of which 500 were indirect employees and 200 were direct employees. The $57 million of charges included $17 million recorded to Cost of sales and $40 million recorded to Other charges. Included in the aggregate $57 million were charges of $64 million for employee separation costs and $5 million for exit costs, partially offset by $12 million of reversals for accruals no longer needed.\nThe following table displays the net charges incurred by business segment due to such reorganizations:\nCash payments for employee severance in connection with the reorganization of business plans were $77 million, $85 million, and $63 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The reorganization of business accruals for employee separation costs at December 31, 2021 were $34 million which we expect to pay within one year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\n42\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nAt December 31, 2021, $1.3 billion of our $1.9 billion cash and cash equivalents balance was held in the U.S. and $568 million was held in other countries, with $180 million held in the United Kingdom. Restricted cash was $2 million at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nIn 2021, we repatriated $527 million in cash to the U.S. from international jurisdictions. We routinely repatriate a portion of non-U.S. earnings each year. We have recorded income tax expense for foreign withholding tax and distribution taxes on such earnings and, under current U.S. tax laws, do not expect to incur material incremental U.S. tax on repatriation.\nWhere appropriate, we may also pursue capital reduction activities; however, such activities can be involved and lengthy. While we regularly repatriate funds, and a portion of offshore funds can be repatriated with minimal adverse financial impact, repatriation of some of these funds may be subject to delay due to local country approvals.\nOperating Activities\nThe increase in operating cash flows from 2020 to 2021 was driven by:\n•\nan increase of operating earnings as a result of higher sales volume; partially offset by\n•\n$76 million of higher income tax payments.\nThe decrease in operating cash flows from 2019 to 2020 was driven by:\n•\na reduction of operating earnings as a result of lower sales volume;\n•\n$43 million of higher income tax payments; partially offset by\n•\nimprovements in working capital.\nInvesting Activities\nThe increase in net cash used by investing activities from 2020 to 2021 was primarily due to:\n•\n$234 million increase in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions of $521 million in 2021 compared to $287 million in 2020;\n•\n$50 million decrease in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment in 2020 that did not recur in 2021; and\n•\n$26 million increase in capital expenditures in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher expenditures for the Airwave and ESN networks.\nThe decrease in net cash used by investing activities from 2019 to 2020 was primarily due to:\n•\n$422 million decrease in acquisitions and investments, driven by acquisitions of $287 million in 2020 compared to $709 million in 2019;\n•\n$56 million increase in proceeds from the sale of property, plant and equipment driven by the sale of a European manufacturing facility in 2020; and\n•\n$31 million decrease in capital expenditures in 2020 compared 2019 due to lower expenditures for the Airwave and ESN networks.\nFinancing Activities\nThe decrease in cash used by financing activities in 2021 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2020 was driven by (also see further discussion in \"Debt,\" \"Credit Facilities,\" \"Share Repurchase Program\" and \"Dividends\" in this section below):\n•\n$844 million net proceeds from the issuance of $850 million of 2.75% senior notes due 2031 in the second quarter of 2021, which was subsequently used to repurchase $324 million principal amount of our 3.5% senior notes due 2023 for a purchase price of $341 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest; and\n•\n$528 million used for purchases under our share repurchase program in 2021 as compared to $612 million in 2020; partially offset by\n•\n$482 million cash used for the payment of dividends in 2021 as compared to $436 million in 2020.\nThe decrease in cash used by financing activities in 2020 compared to cash used by financing activities in 2019 was driven by:\n•\n$400 million used for the repayment of the term loan in 2019;\n•\n$1.0 billion received from the issuance of 1.75% senior convertible notes due 2024 in 2019 which was subsequently used for the settlement of $1.1 billion of the 2.00% senior convertible notes, inclusive of the $326 million conversion premium in 2019;\n•\n$804 million net proceeds from the issuance of $800 million of 4.6% senior notes due 2029 in 2019, which was subsequently used to repurchase $614 million principal amount of long-term debt under a tender offer and\n43\n$150 million principal amount for the 3.5% senior notes due 2021 for a total purchase price of $809 million in 2019;\n•\n$892 million net proceeds from the issuance of $900 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2030 in the third quarter of 2020, which was subsequently used to repurchase $552 million principal amount of 3.75% senior notes due 2022 and $293 million principal amount of long-term debt under a tender offer for a total purchase price of $897 million in 2020;\n•\n$800 million net proceeds from the draw on our syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility during 2020 which was subsequently repaid during the year; partially offset by\n•\n$612 million used for purchases under our share repurchase program in 2020 as compared to $315 million in 2019; and\n•\n$436 million cash used for the payment of dividends in 2020 as compared to $379 million in 2019.\nSales of Receivables\nWe may choose to sell accounts receivable and long-term receivables to third-parties under one-time arrangements. We may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term receivables.\nThe following table summarizes the proceeds received from sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, we utilized a cost-efficient receivable discounting facility, implemented in 2020, to neutralize the impact of increased payment terms under a renegotiated and extended long-term contract in Europe resulting in accounts receivable sales of $211 million during the year ended December 31, 2021. The proceeds of our receivable sales are included in \"Operating Activities\" within our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $940 million of long-term receivables, compared to $983 million of long-term receivables at December 31, 2020. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities related to the sales of accounts receivables and long-term receivables.\nDebt\nWe had outstanding long-term debt of $5.7 billion and $5.2 billion, including the current portions of $5 million and $12 million, at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nOn September 5, 2019, in connection with our repurchase and settlement of the outstanding principal amount of 2.00% senior convertible notes due 2020 issued to Silver Lake Partners, we entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue $1.0 billion of 1.75% senior convertible notes which mature in September 2024 (the \"Senior Convertible Notes\"). Interest on these notes is payable semiannually. The Senior Notes became fully convertible on September 5, 2021. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 4.9140 per $1,000 principal amount (which is equal to an initial conversion price of $203.50 per share). In November 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved an irrevocable determination requiring the future settlement of the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes to be settled in cash\n.\nWe recorded a debt liability associated with the Senior Convertible Notes by determining the fair value of an equivalent debt instrument without a conversion option. Using a discount rate of 2.45%, which was determined based on a review of relevant market data, we calculated the debt liability to be $986 million, indicating a $14 million discount to be amortized over the expected life of the debt instrument. As of December 31, 2021, the debt discount has been fully amortized as a component of interest expense. Our off-balance sheet arrangement of the obligation to settle the conversion option under the Senior Convertible Notes is more fully discussed in \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K.\nIn August of 2020, we issued $900 million of 2.30% senior notes due 2030. We recognized net proceeds of $892 million after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. A portion of these proceeds were then used to redeem $552 million in principal amount outstanding of the 3.75% senior notes due 2022 for a redemption price of $582 million, excluding $7 million of accrued interest. The remaining proceeds were used to repurchase $293 million in principal amount outstanding of our long-term debt under a tender offer, for a purchase price of $315 million, excluding $5 million of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, we recognized a loss of $56 million related to the redemption and the repurchase in Other, net within Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\n44\nIn May of 2021, we issued $850 million of 2.75% senior notes due 2031. We recognized net proceeds of $844 million after debt issuance costs. A portion of these proceeds was then used to redeem $324 million in principal amount of our outstanding long-term debt for a purchase price of $341 million, excluding $3 million of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs, we recognized a loss of $18 million related to the redemption in Other, net within Other income (expense) in our Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nWe have an unsecured commercial paper program, backed by the revolving credit facility described below, under which we may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $2.2 billion outstanding at any one time. At maturity, the notes are paid back in full including the interest component. The notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding debt under the commercial paper program.\nCredit Facilities\nOn March 24, 2021, we entered into a $2.25 billion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in March 2026 (the \"2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement\"). The 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit and fronting commitments of $450 million. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), at our option. The 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes provisions allowing us to replace LIBOR with a replacement benchmark rate in the future under certain conditions defined in the agreement. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if our credit rating changes. We must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the\n. We were in compliance with the financial covenants as of December 31, 2021.\nShare Repurchase Program\nThrough a series of actions, including approval in May 2021 to increase the authorized amount by $2.0 billion, the Board of Directors has authorized an aggregate share repurchase amount of up to $16.0 billion of our outstanding shares of common stock (the “share repurchase program”). The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, we used approximately $13.9 billion of the share repurchase authority, including transaction costs, to repurchase shares, leaving approximately $2.1 billion of authority available for future repurchases.\nOur share repurchases, including transaction costs, for 2021, 2020, and 2019 are summarized as follows:\nDividends\nWe paid cash dividends to holders of our common stock of $482 million in 2021, $436 million in 2020, and $379 million in 2019. On January 14, 2022, we paid an additional $134 million in cash dividends to holders of our common stock.\nAdequate Internal Funding Resources\nWe believe that we have adequate internal resources available to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet our expected working capital, capital expenditure and cash requirements for the next twelve months and the foreseeable future, as supported by the level of cash and cash equivalents in the U.S., the ability to repatriate funds from foreign jurisdictions, cash provided by operations, as well as liquidity provided by our commercial paper program backed by the 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement.\nWe do not anticipate a material decrease to net future cash flows generated from operations. We expect to use our available cash, investments, and debt facilities to support and invest in our business. This includes investing in our existing products and technologies, seeking new acquisition opportunities related to our strategic growth initiatives and returning cash to shareholders through common stock cash dividend payments (subject to the discretion of our Board of Directors) and share repurchases. Refer to “COVID-19” in this section of the Form 10-K for a discussion of the impact of COVID-19 on our liquidity, as well as \"Part I. Item 1A. Risk Factors\" for further discussion regarding access to the capital markets.\n45\nMaterial Cash Requirements from Contractual and Other Obligations\nSummarized in the table and text below are our short-term (within the next twelve months) and long-term material cash requirements as of December 31, 2021, which we expect to fund with a combination of operating cash flows, existing cash balances or, as needed, borrowings under new or existing debt:\n(1)\nAmounts included represent the estimated principal payments applicable to outstanding debt. Refer to \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" in \"Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for discussion related to our long-term debt obligations.\n(2)\nWe lease certain office, factory and warehouse space, land, and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases. In light of the uncertain COVID-19 environment, we are evaluating our needs for office space opportunities to reduce long-term cash requirements for office space where practicable. Refer to \"Note 3: Leases\" to our consolidated financial statements in \"Part II. Item 8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" of this Form 10-K for further discussion of these material lease obligations.\n(3)\nAmounts included represent firm, non-cancelable commitments. Such commitments include license agreements and  agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow them to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by us or establish the parameters defining our requirements. We do not anticipate the cancellation of any of our take-or-pay agreements in the future and estimate that purchases from these suppliers will exceed the minimum obligations during the agreement periods.\nOther Contingencies\nPotential Contractual Damage Claims in Excess of Underlying Contract Value:\nIn certain circumstances, we enter into contracts with customers pursuant to which the damages that could be claimed by the customer for failed performance might exceed the revenue we receive from the contract. Contracts with these types of uncapped damages provisions are fairly rare, but individual contracts could still represent meaningful risk. There is a possibility that a claim by a counterparty to one of these contracts could result in expenses that are far in excess of the revenue received from the counterparty in connection with the contract.\nIndemnification Provisions:\nWe may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, we have not made significant payments under these agreements, nor have there been significant claims asserted against us. However, there is an increasing risk in relation to intellectual property indemnities given the current legal climate. In indemnification cases, payment by us is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow us to challenge the other party’s claims. In some instances we may have recourse against third-parties for certain payments made by us.\nLegal Matters:\nWe are a defendant in various lawsuits, claims, and actions, which arise in the normal course of business. In the opinion of management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, an unfavorable resolution could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the periods in which the matters are ultimately resolved, or in the periods in which more information is obtained that changes management's opinion of the ultimate disposition.\nLong-term Customer Financing Commitments\nOutstanding Commitments:\nCertain purchasers of our products and services may request that we provide long-term financing (defined as financing with a term of greater than one year) in connection with the sale of equipment. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the products and services. Our obligation to provide long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of us by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from us. We had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third-parties totaling $56 million at December 31, 2021 and at December 31, 2020.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nThis Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations discusses our consolidated financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (\"GAAP\"). The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period.\n46\nManagement bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience, current economic and industry conditions and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. This forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions. The Company believes that the following discussion addresses the Company’s most critical accounting policies and estimates, which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the Company’s financial condition and results of operations and require management’s most difficult, subjective and complex judgments.\nRevenue Recognition\nWe enter into arrangements which consist of multiple promises to our customers. We evaluate whether the promised goods and services are distinct or a series of distinct goods or services. Where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, we generally allocate the total estimated consideration to each performance obligation based on applying an estimated selling price (“ESP”) as our best estimate of standalone selling price. We determine ESP by: (i) collecting all reasonably available data points including sales, cost and margin analyses of the product or services, and other inputs based on our normal pricing and discounting practices, (ii) making any reasonably required adjustments to the data based on market and Company-specific factors, and (iii) stratifying the data points, when appropriate, based on major product or service, type of customer, geographic market, and sales volume.\nWe account for certain system contracts on an over-time basis, electing an input method of estimated costs as a measure of performance completed. The selection of the measurement of progress using estimated costs was based on a thorough consideration of alternatives of various output and input measures, including contract milestones and labor hours. However, we have determined that other input and output measures are not an appropriate measure of progress as they do not accurately align with the transfer of control on our customized systems. The selection of costs incurred as a measure of progress aligns the transfer of control to the overall production of the customized system.\nFor system contracts accounted for over time using estimated costs as a measure of performance completed, we rely on estimates around the total estimated costs to complete the contract (“Estimated Costs at Completion”). Total Estimated Costs at Completion include direct labor, material and subcontracting costs. Due to the nature of the efforts required to be performed to meet the underlying performance obligation, determining Estimated Costs at Completion may be complex and subject to many variables. We have a standard and disciplined quarterly process in which management reviews the progress and performance of open contracts in order to determine the best estimate of Estimated Costs at Completion. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion, the project schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of costs. The risks and opportunities include management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, and performance by subcontractors, among other variables. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustment to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recorded as necessary in the period they become known. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nRetirement Benefits\nOur benefit obligations and net periodic pension costs (benefits) associated with our domestic noncontributory pension plans (“U.S. Pension Benefit Plans”), our foreign noncontributory pension plans (“Non-U.S. Plans”), as well as our domestic postretirement health care plan (“Postretirement Health Care Benefits”), are determined using actuarial assumptions. The assumptions are based on management’s best estimates, after consulting with outside investment advisors and actuaries.\nAccounting methodologies use an attribution approach that generally spreads the effects of individual events over the service lives of the participants in the plan, or estimated average lifetime when almost all of the plan participants are considered \"inactive.\" Examples of “events” are plan amendments and changes in actuarial assumptions such as discount rate, expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and rate of compensation increases.\nThere are various assumptions used in calculating the net periodic costs (benefits) and related benefit obligations. One of these assumptions is the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. The required use of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets may result in recognized pension income that is greater or less than the actual returns of those plan assets in any given year. Over time, however, the expected long-term returns are designed to approximate the actual long-term returns.  We use a five-year, market-related asset value method of recognizing asset related gains and losses.\nWe use long-term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to develop our expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the net periodic pension cost (benefit) and the net postretirement health care benefit. Our investment return assumption for the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans was 6.75% in 2021 and 6.85% in 2020. Our investment return assumption for the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan was 6.75% in 2021 and 6.90% in 2020. Our weighted average investment return assumption for the Non-U.S. Plans was 4.54% in 2021 and 4.66% in 2020. For the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, a 25 bps increase in expected return on plan assets would result in $9 million of additional net periodic pension cost and a 25 bps decrease would result in a $9 million benefit to net periodic pension cost.  The impact of a similar increase or decrease on the Non-U.S. Plans and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits plan would be de minimis.\n47\nA second key assumption is the discount rate. The discount rate assumptions used for the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans, the Non-U.S. Plans and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan reflect, at December 31 of each year, the prevailing market rates for high-quality, fixed-income debt instruments that, if the obligation was settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. Our discount rates for measuring our U.S. Pension Benefit Plan obligations were 2.98% and 2.63% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our weighted average discount rates for measuring our Non-U.S. Plans were 1.82% and 1.24% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Our discount rates for measuring the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan obligation were 2.78% and 2.39% at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nA change in our discount rate on the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan would be de minimis. The effects of a change in the discount rate on the projected benefit obligation for both the U.S. and Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans are as follows:\nUnder relevant accounting rules, when almost all of the plan participants are considered inactive, the amortization period for certain unrecognized losses changes from the average remaining service period to the average remaining lifetime of the participant. As such, depending on the specific plan, we amortize gains and losses over periods ranging from nine to thirty years. Prior service costs are being amortized over periods ranging from two to thirty years. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based on the projected unit credit cost method.\nValuation and Recoverability of Goodwill\nWe assess the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. Goodwill is assessed more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount. We continually assess whether any such events and circumstances have occurred, which requires a significant amount of judgment. Such events and circumstances may include: (i) adverse changes in macroeconomic conditions, (ii) adverse changes in the industry or market in which we transact, (iii) changes in cost factors negatively impacting earnings and cash flows, (iv) negative or declining overall financial performance, (v) events affecting the carrying value or composition of a reporting unit, or (vi) a sustained decrease in share price, among others. Any such adverse event or change in circumstances could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nThe goodwill impairment assessment is performed at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment (referred to as a “component”). A component of an operating segment is a reporting unit if the component constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and segment management regularly reviews the operating results of that component. When two or more components of an operating segment have similar economic characteristics, the components are aggregated and deemed a single reporting unit. An operating segment is deemed to be a reporting unit if all of its components are similar, if none of its components is a reporting unit, or if the segment comprises only a single component. Based on this guidance, we have determined that our Products and Systems Integration and Software and Services segments are comprised of three and two reporting units, respectively. The Company performed a qualitative assessment to determine whether it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit was less than its carrying amount for the fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019. In performing this qualitative assessment we assessed relevant events and circumstances including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, cost factors, overall financial performance, changes in enterprise value, and entity-specific events. For fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, we concluded it was more-likely-than-not that the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value.\nValuation of Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities\nWe use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes. Under this method, income tax expense is recognized for the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year. In addition, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards. Management makes assumptions, judgments and estimates to determine our current and deferred tax provision and also the deferred tax assets and liabilities. We evaluate our deferred tax assets quarterly to determine if adjustments to our valuation allowance are required based on the consideration of all available positive and negative evidence.\nOur assumptions, judgments and estimates for computing the income tax provision takes into account current tax laws, our interpretation of current tax law and possible outcomes of current and future audits conducted by foreign and domestic tax authorities. We believe such estimates to be reasonable; however, the final determination of certain audits could significantly impact the amounts provided for income taxes in our financial statements.\n48\nRecent Accounting Pronouncements\nSee “Note 1: Summary of Significant Accounting Policies” to our consolidated financial statements in “Part II.

    "text": "Interest Rate Risk\nOur exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long-term debt as interest rate fluctuations impact the fair value of our long-term debt. As of December 31, 2021, we had $5.7 billion of long-term debt, including the current portion, which is primarily priced at long-term, fixed interest rates. A hypothetical 10% decrease in interest rates as of the end of 2021 would have increased the fair value of our debt by approximately $60 million at December 31, 2021. See \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" to the consolidated financial statements included in “Part II. Item 8: Financial Statements and Supplementary Data” of this Form 10-K for more information on our long-term debt.\nForeign Currency Risk\nWe are exposed to foreign currency risk as a result of buying and selling in various currencies, our net investments in foreign entities, and monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument. We use financial instruments to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. Our policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on exchange rate price fluctuations, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into transactions for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.\nOur strategy related to foreign exchange exposure management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments against losses or gains on the underlying operational cash flows, net investments or monetary assets and liabilities based on our assessment of risk. We enter into derivative contracts for some of our non-functional currency cash, receivables, and payables, which are primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open markets. Our policy permits us to use forward contracts and options to hedge these currency exposures. In addition, we enter into derivative contracts for some forecasted transactions or net investments in some of our overseas entities, which are designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. A portion of our exposure is from currencies that are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product pricing and component sourcing.\nAt December 31, 2021, we had outstanding foreign exchange contracts totaling $1.1 billion, compared to $1.2 billion outstanding at December 31, 2020. Management does not believe these financial instruments should subject it to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.\nThe following table shows the five largest net notional amounts of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of December 31, 2021 and the corresponding positions as of December 31, 2020:\nForeign exchange financial instruments that are subject to the effects of currency fluctuations, which may affect reported earnings, include derivative financial instruments and other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the legal entity holding the instrument. Currently, our derivative financial instruments consist primarily of currency forward contracts. Other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the legal entity consist primarily of cash, cash equivalents, accounts payable and accounts receivable. Assuming the amounts of the outstanding foreign exchange contracts represent our underlying foreign exchange risk related to monetary assets and liabilities, a hypothetical unfavorable 10% movement in the foreign exchange rates at December 31, 2021 would reduce the value of those monetary assets and liabilities by approximately $59 million. Our market risk calculation represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized assuming hypothetical 10% movements in future currency market pricing and is not necessarily indicative of actual results, which may or may not occur. It does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur, since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated, based upon, among other things, actual fluctuation in market rates, operating exposures, and the timing thereof. We believe, however, that any such loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying derivative financial instruments transactions.\n50"

Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated\nfinancial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated\nfinancial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated\nfinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated\nfinancial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated\n52\nfinancial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nRevenue Recognition - Estimated Costs to Complete System Contracts\nAs described in Note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, $1.9 billion of the Company’s total revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021 was generated from System contracts. The Company recognizes revenue on a significant portion of System contracts on an over-time basis, electing an input method of estimated costs as a measure of performance completed. For contracts accounted for over-time using estimated costs as a measure of performance completed, the Company relies on estimates of the total estimated costs to complete the contract (“Estimated Costs at Completion”). Total Estimated Costs at Completion include direct labor, material and subcontracting costs. Due to the nature of the efforts required to meet the underlying performance obligation, determining Estimated Costs at Completion may be complex and subject to many variables. As disclosed by management, management reviews the progress and performance of open contracts in order to determine the best estimate of Estimated Costs at Completion. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion, the project schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of costs. The risks and opportunities include management’s judgments about the ability and the cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the Estimated Costs at Completion for System contracts is a critical audit matter are the significant judgments by management when developing the Estimated Costs at Completion, which in turn led to a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity and effort in performing procedures to evaluate management’s estimates related to management’s judgments about the cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the revenue recognition process, including controls over the determination of Estimated Costs at Completion. These procedures also included, among others, evaluating and testing management’s process for determining the Estimated Costs at Completion for a sample of contracts. Management’s process for determining the Estimated Costs at Completion was evaluated for reasonableness by (i) performing a comparison of the originally estimated and actual costs incurred on completed contracts; (ii) evaluating the timely identification of circumstances that may warrant a modification to Estimated Costs at Completion; and (iii) analyzing contracts and project schedules that support those estimates.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 16, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2018.\n53\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n54\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n55\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n56\nConsolidated Statements of Stockholders’ Equity (Deficit)\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n57\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nSee accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements.\n58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(Dollars in millions, except as noted)\n1.\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nPrinciples of Consolidation\n:\nThe consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Motorola Solutions, Inc. (the “Company” or “Motorola Solutions”) and all controlled subsidiaries. All intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.\nThe consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 and for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, include, in the opinion of management, all adjustments (consisting of normal recurring adjustments and reclassifications) necessary to present fairly the Company's consolidated financial position, results of operations, statements of comprehensive income, and statements of stockholders' equity and cash flows for all periods presented.\nUse of Estimates:\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with United States (\"U.S.\") Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nRevenue Recognition:\nNet sales consist of a wide range of goods and services including the delivery of devices, systems and system integration and a full set of software and service offerings. The Company recognizes revenue to reflect the transfer of control of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled in exchange for goods or services.\nThe Products and Systems Integration segment is comprised of devices, systems, and systems integration for our LMR and Video Security and Access Control technologies. Direct customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are typically government, public safety agencies, procuring at state, local, and federal levels as well as large commercial customers with secure mission-critical needs. Indirect customers are defined as customers purchasing professional commercial radios and video security, which are primarily sold through the Company's reseller partners to an end-customer base, composed of various industries where private communications networks and video security are used to secure operations and enable a mobile workforce. Contracts with the Company's customers are typically fixed fee, with consideration measured net of associated sales taxes, and, as it relates to our direct customers, funded through government appropriations. For Products and Systems Integration sales, the Company records consideration from shipping and handling on a gross basis within Net sales.\nLMR and Video Security and Access Control devices include two-way portable and vehicle-mounted radios, fixed and mobile video cameras and accessories. Devices are considered capable of being distinct and distinct within the context of the Company's contracts. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of the devices to the customer at a point in time, typically consistent with delivery under the applicable shipping terms. Devices are sold by both the direct sales force and through reseller partners. Revenue is generally recognized upon transfer of devices to reseller partners, rather than the end-customer, except for limited consignment arrangements. Provisions for returns and reseller discounts are made on a portfolio basis using historical data.\nThe Products and Systems Integration segment includes both customized radio networks and video security solutions, including the integration of these networks with devices, software, and applications within both LMR and Video Security and Access Control technologies. For systems contracts, revenue for the year ended December 31, 2021 was $\n1.9\nbillion compared to $\n1.8\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n1.9\nbillion for the year ended December 31, 2019. The networks include the aggregation of promises to the customer to provide i) a radio network core and central processing software, base stations, consoles, and repeaters or ii) a video security solution including video analytics, network video management hardware and software, and access control solutions. The individual promises of the radio network are not distinct in the context of the contract, as the Company provides a significant service of integrating and customizing the goods and services promised. The radio network represents a distinct performance obligation for which revenue is recognized over time, as the Company creates an asset with no alternative use and has an enforceable right to payment for work performed. The Company's revenue recognition over time is based on an input measure of costs incurred, which depicts the transfer of control to its customers under its contracts. Products and Systems Integration revenue is recognized over an average duration of approximately\none\nto\ntwo years\n. Individual promises of the video security solution are capable of being distinct and distinct in the context of the contract. Video security solutions are traditionally sold through reseller partners, with contracts negotiated under fixed pricing. Revenue is recognized upon the transfer of control of the video solution to the reseller partners, typically upon shipment.\nThe Software and Services segment provides a full set of offerings for government, public safety and commercial communication networks. Direct customers of the Software and Services segment are typically government, public safety and first-responder agencies and municipalities. Indirect customers are commercial customers who distribute broadband push-to-talk services to a final end customer base. Contracts with our customers are typically fixed fee, with consideration measured net of associated sales taxes, and, as it relates to our direct customers, funded through government appropriations.\nSoftware offerings primarily include Command Center Software and Video Security and Access Control software and services which can be delivered either “as a service” or on-premise. Solutions delivered as a service consist of a range of promises including hosted software, technical support and the right to unspecified future software enhancements. Software is not distinct from the hosting service since the customer does not have the right to take possession of the software at any time during the term of the arrangement. The hosted software, technical support, and right to unspecified future software enhancements each represent a series of distinct services that are delivered concurrently using the same over-time method. As such, the promises are accounted for as a single performance obligation with revenue recognized on a straight-line basis.\n59\nOn-premise offerings consist of multiple promises primarily including software licenses and post-contract customer support. The promises are generally each distinct and distinct within the context of the contract as the customer benefits from each promise individually without any significant integration or interrelationship between the promises. On-premise software revenue is generally recognized at the point in time when the customer can benefit from the software which generally aligns with the beginning of the license period. Revenue for post-contract customer support is recognized over time as the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the services on a straight-line basis. In certain situations when the software license is not distinct within the context of the contract, revenue for the software license is recognized over time following the transfer of control under the arrangement.\nServices include a continuum of service offerings beginning with repair, technical support and maintenance. More advanced offerings include: monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed service offerings range from partial to full operation of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned networks. Services are provided across all technologies and are both distinct and capable of being distinct in the context of the contract, representing a series of recurring services that the Company stands ready to perform over the contract term. Since services contracts typically allow for customers to terminate for convenience or for non-appropriations of fiscal funding, the contract term is generally considered to be limited to a monthly or annual basis, subject to customer renewal. While contracts with customers are typically fixed fee, certain managed services contracts may be subject to variable consideration related to the achievement of service level agreement performance measurements. The Company has not historically paid significant penalties under service level agreements, and accordingly, it does not constrain its contract price. Certain contracts may also contain variable consideration driven by the number of users. Revenue is typically recognized on services over time as a series of services performed over the contract term on a straight-line basis.\nThe Company enters into arrangements which consist of multiple promises to our customers. The Company evaluates whether the promised goods and services are distinct or a series of distinct goods or services. Where contracts contain multiple performance obligations, the Company generally allocates the total estimated consideration to each performance obligation based on applying an estimated selling price (“ESP”) as our best estimate of standalone selling price. The Company determines ESP by: (i) collecting all reasonably available data points including sales, cost and margin analyses of the product or services, and other inputs based on its normal pricing and discounting practices, (ii) making any reasonably required adjustments to the data based on market and Company-specific factors, and (iii) stratifying the data points, when appropriate, based on major product or service, type of customer, geographic market, and sales volume.\nThe Company accounts for certain system contracts on an over-time basis, electing an input method of estimated costs as a measure of performance completed. The selection of the measurement of progress using estimated costs was based on a thorough consideration of alternatives of various output and input measures, including contract milestones and labor hours. However, the Company has determined that other input and output measures are not an appropriate measure of progress as they do not accurately align with the transfer of control on its customized systems. The selection of costs incurred as a measure of progress aligns the transfer of control to the overall production of the customized system.\nFor system contracts accounted for over time using estimated costs as a measure of performance completed, the Company relies on estimates around the total estimated costs to complete the contract (“Estimated Costs at Completion”). Total Estimated Costs at Completion include direct labor, material and subcontracting costs. Due to the nature of the efforts required to be performed to meet the underlying performance obligation, determining Estimated Costs at Completion may be complex and subject to many variables. The Company has a standard and disciplined quarterly process in which management reviews the progress and performance of open contracts in order to determine the best estimate of Estimated Costs at Completion. As part of this process, management reviews information including, but not limited to, any outstanding key contract matters, progress towards completion, the project schedule, identified risks and opportunities, and the related changes in estimates of costs. The risks and opportunities include management’s judgment about the ability and cost to achieve the project schedule, technical requirements, and other contract requirements. Management must make assumptions and estimates regarding labor productivity and availability, the complexity of work to be performed, the availability and cost of materials, and performance by subcontractors, among other variables. Based on this analysis, any quarterly adjustment to net sales, cost of sales, and the related impact to operating income are recorded as necessary in the period they become known. When estimates of total costs to be incurred on a contract exceed estimates of total revenue to be earned, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recorded in the period in which the loss is determined.\nCash Equivalents:\nThe Company considers all highly-liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents.\nRestricted cash was $\n2\nmillion at both December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nInvestments:\nThe Company generally invests in debt and equity securities of a strategic nature.\nThe Company applies the equity method of accounting for equity investments if the Company has significant influence over the issuing entity. The Company’s share of the investee’s underlying net income or loss is recorded to Other within Other income (expense).\nEquity securities with readily determinable fair values are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded in Other, net within Other income (expense). Equity securities without readily determinable fair values are carried at cost, less impairments, if any, and adjusted for observable price changes for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer. The Company performs a qualitative impairment assessment to determine if such investments are impaired. The qualitative assessment considers all available information, including declines in the financial performance of the issuing entity, the issuing\n60\nentity’s operating environment, and general market conditions. Impairments of equity securities without readily determinable fair values are recorded in Other, net within Other income (expense).\nInvestments in debt securities are classified as available-for-sale and held-to-maturity on the basis of the Company’s intent and ability to hold the investments. Investments classified as available-for-sale are carried at fair value with changes reflected in other comprehensive income. Any credit-related impairment is recognized through an allowance for expected credit losses, and adjusted subsequently if conditions change, with a corresponding impact in earnings. Where there is an intention or a requirement to sell an impaired available-for-sale debt security, the entire impairment is recognized in earnings with a corresponding adjustment to the amortized cost basis of the security. Investments classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost less allowance for credit losses recorded through net income.\nInventories:\nInventories are valued at the lower of cost (which approximates cost on a first-in, first-out basis) and net realizable value.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment:\nProperty, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is recorded on a straight-line basis, based on the estimated useful lives of the assets (leasehold improvements,\none\nto\ntwenty years\n; machinery and equipment,\none\nto\nfifteen years\n) and commences once the assets are ready for their intended use. When certain events or changes in operating conditions occur, useful lives of the assets may be adjusted or an impairment assessment may be performed on the recoverability of the carrying value.\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets:\nGoodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually at the reporting unit, or more frequently if events or circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value level. The Company performs its annual assessment of goodwill for impairment in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year, typically through a qualitative assessment. Indicators of impairment include: (i) macroeconomic conditions, (ii) industry and market conditions, (iii) cost factors, including product and selling, general and administrative costs, (iv) overall financial performance of the Company, (v) changes in share price, and (vi) other relevant company-specific events. If it is determined that it is more-likely-than-not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount, the Company will perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test, which compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value, the Company would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess, limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit. Fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and market prices of comparable businesses.\nIntangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their respective estimated useful lives ranging from\none\nto\ntwenty years\n. The Company has no intangible assets with indefinite useful lives.\nLeases:\nThe Company leases certain office, factory and warehouse space, land and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception of the contract. The Company’s key considerations in determining whether a contract is or contains a lease include establishing whether the supplier has the ability to use other assets to fulfill its service or whether the terms of the agreement enable the Company to control the use of a dedicated asset during the contract term. In the majority of the Company’s contracts where it must identify whether a lease is present, it is readily determinable that the Company controls the use of the assets and obtains substantially all of the economic benefit during the term of the contract. In those contracts where identification is not readily determinable, the Company has determined that the supplier has either the ability to use another asset to provide the service or the terms of the contract give the supplier the right to operate the asset at its discretion during the term of the contract.\nRight-of-use (\"ROU\") assets and operating lease liabilities are recognized based on the present value of the future minimum lease payments over the lease term at the commencement date. The Company’s lease payments are typically fixed or contain fixed escalators. The Company has elected to not separate lease and non-lease components for all of its current lease categories and therefore, all consideration is included in lease payments. For the Company’s leases consisting of land and other equipment (i.e. “communication network sites”), future payments are subject to variability due to changes in indices or rates. The Company values its ROU assets and lease liabilities based on the index or rate in effect at lease commencement. Future changes in the indices or rates are accounted for as variable lease costs. Other variable lease costs include items that are not fixed at lease commencement including property taxes, insurance, and operating charges that vary based on usage. ROU assets also include lease payments made in advance and are net of lease incentives.\nAs the majority of the Company’s leases do not provide an implicit rate, the Company uses its incremental borrowing rates based on the information available at the commencement date in determining the present value of future payments. The Company’s incremental borrowing rates are based on the term of the lease, the economic environment of the lease, and the effect of collateralization.\nThe Company's lease terms range from\none\nto\ntwenty-one years\nand may include options to extend the lease by\none\nto\nten years\nor terminate the lease after the initial non-cancelable term. The Company does not include options in the determination of the lease term for the majority of leases as sufficient economic factors do not exist that would compel it to continue to use the underlying asset beyond the initial non-cancelable term. However, for the Company's communication network site leases that are necessary to provide services to customers under managed service arrangements, the Company includes options in the lease term to the extent of the customer contracts to which those leases relate.\n61\nImpairment of Long-Lived Assets:\nLong-lived assets, which include intangible assets, held and used by the Company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable. The Company evaluates recoverability of assets to be held and used by comparing the carrying amount of an asset (group) to future net undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset (group). If an asset (group) is considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized is equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset (group) exceeds the asset's (group's) fair value calculated using a discounted future cash flows analysis or market comparable analysis. Assets held for sale, if any, are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.\nIncome Taxes:\nThe Company records deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the estimated future tax effects of differences between the financial and tax bases of assets and liabilities based on currently enacted tax laws. The Company's deferred and other tax balances are based on management's interpretation of the tax regulations and rulings in numerous tax jurisdictions. Income tax expenses and liabilities recognized by the Company also reflect its best estimates and assumptions regarding, among other things, the level of future taxable income, the effect of the Company's various tax planning strategies, and uncertain tax positions. Future tax authority rulings and changes in tax laws, changes in projected levels of taxable income, and future tax planning strategies could affect the actual effective tax rate and tax balances recorded by the Company.\nLong-Term Receivables:\nLong-term receivables include trade receivables where contractual terms of the note agreement are greater than\none year\n. The Company estimates credit losses on accounts receivable based on historical losses and then takes into account estimates of current and future economic conditions. Long-term receivables are considered past due if payments have not been received according to the contractual terms of the note agreement, including principal and interest. Impaired long-term receivables are valued based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the receivable’s effective interest rate, or the fair value of the collateral if the receivable is collateral dependent. Interest income and late fees on impaired long-term receivables are recognized only when payments are received. Previously impaired long-term receivables are no longer considered impaired and are reclassified to performing when they have performed under restructuring for four consecutive quarters.\nEnvironmental Liabilities:\nThe Company maintains a liability related to ongoing remediation efforts of environmental media such as groundwater, soil, and soil vapor, as well as related legal fees for a designated Superfund site under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (commonly known as the “Superfund Act”) incurred by a legacy business. It is the Company’s policy to re-evaluate the reserve when certain events become known that will impact the future cash payments. When the timing and amount of the future cash payments are fixed or reliably determinable, the Company discounts the future cash flows used in estimating the accrual using a risk-free treasury rate. The current portion of the estimated environmental liability is included in the Accrued liabilities statement line and the non-current portion is included in the Other liabilities statement line within the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nForeign Currency:\nCertain non-U.S. operations within the Company use their respective local currency as their functional currency. Those operations that do not have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency translate assets and liabilities at current rates of exchange in effect at the balance sheet date and revenues and expenses using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. The resulting translation adjustments are included as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. For those operations that have the U.S. dollar as their functional currency, transactions denominated in the local currency are measured in U.S. dollars using the current rates of exchange for monetary assets and liabilities and historical rates of exchange for nonmonetary assets. Gains and losses from remeasurement of monetary assets and liabilities are included in Other within Other income (expense) within the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company uses financial instruments to reduce its overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows. The Company’s policy prohibits speculation in financial instruments for profit on exchange rate fluctuations, trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures, or entering into transactions for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure.\nThe Company’s strategy related to foreign exchange exposure management is to offset the gains or losses on the financial instruments against gains or losses on the underlying operational cash flows, net investments or monetary assets and liabilities based on the Company's assessment of risk. The Company enters into derivative contracts for some of its non-functional currency cash, receivables, and payables, which are primarily denominated in major currencies that can be traded on open markets. The Company typically uses forward contracts and options to hedge these currency exposures. In addition, the Company has entered into derivative contracts for some forecasted transactions or net investments in some of its overseas entities, which are designated as part of a hedging relationship if it is determined that the transaction qualifies for hedge accounting under the provisions of the authoritative accounting guidance for derivative instruments and hedging activities. A portion of the Company’s exposure is from currencies that are not traded in liquid markets and these are addressed, to the extent reasonably possible, by managing net asset positions, product pricing and component sourcing.\nDerivative Instruments:\nGains and losses on hedging instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recorded immediately in Other income (expense) within the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses pertaining to instruments designated as net investment hedges that qualify for hedge accounting are recognized as a component of Accumulated other comprehensive income. Components excluded from the assessment of hedge ineffectiveness in net investment hedges are included in Accumulated other comprehensive income at their initial value and amortized into Interest expense, net on a straight-line basis.\n62\nFair Value Measurements:\nThe Company holds certain fixed income securities, equity securities and derivatives, which are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements. Fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date and is measured using the fair value hierarchy. This hierarchy prescribes valuation techniques based on whether the inputs to each measurement are observable or unobservable. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company's assumptions about current market conditions. The prescribed fair value hierarchy and related valuation methodologies are as follows:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active, and model-derived valuations, in which all significant inputs are observable, in active markets.\nLevel 3 — Valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.\nEarnings Per Share:\nThe Company calculates its basic earnings per share based on the weighted-average number of common shares issued and outstanding. Net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. is divided by the weighted average common shares outstanding during the period to arrive at the basic earnings per share. Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. by the sum of the weighted-average number of common shares used in the basic earnings per share calculation and the weighted-average number of common shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive securities, excluding those securities that would be anti-dilutive to the earnings per share calculation. Both basic and diluted earnings per share amounts are calculated for net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. for all periods presented.\nShare-Based Compensation Costs:\nThe Company grants share-based compensation awards and offers an employee stock purchase plan. The amount of compensation cost for these share-based awards is generally measured based on the fair value of the awards as of the date that the share-based awards are issued and adjusted to the estimated number of awards that are expected to vest. The fair values of stock options and stock appreciation rights are generally determined using a Black-Scholes option pricing model which incorporates assumptions about expected volatility, risk-free rate, dividend yield, and expected life. Performance-based stock options, performance-contingent stock options, and market stock units vest based on market conditions and are therefore measured under a Monte Carlo simulation in order to simulate a range of possible future unit prices for Motorola Solutions over the performance period. Compensation cost for share-based awards is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period.\nDefined Benefit Plans:\nThe Company records annual expenses relating to its defined benefit plans based on calculations which include various actuarial assumptions, including discount rates, assumed asset rates of return, compensation increases, and turnover rates. The Company reviews its actuarial assumptions on an annual basis and makes modifications to the assumptions based on current rates and trends. Under relevant accounting rules, when almost all of the plan participants are considered inactive, the amortization period for certain unrecognized gains and losses changes from the average remaining service period to the average remaining lifetime of the participants. As such, depending on the specific plan, the Company amortizes gains and losses over periods ranging from\nnine\nto\nthirty years\n. Prior service costs will be amortized over periods ranging from\ntwo\nto\nthirty years\n. Benefits under all pension plans are valued based on the projected unit credit cost method.\nThe funded status, or projected benefit obligation less plan assets, for each plan, is reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets using a December 31 measurement date.\nThe benefit obligation and plan assets for the Company's U.S. Pension Benefit Plan and Postretirement Health Care Benefit Plan are measured as of December 31, 2021. The Company utilizes a five-year, market-related asset value method of recognizing asset related gains and losses.\nRecent Acquisitions:\nOn December 16, 2021, the Company acquired 911 Datamaster, Inc.

The new guidance removes the separation models for convertible debt with a cash conversion feature or a beneficial conversion feature. In addition, the new standard provides guidance on calculating the dilutive impact of convertible debt on earnings per share. The ASU clarifies that the average market price should be used to calculate the diluted earnings per share denominator when the exercise price or the number of shares that may be issued is variable. The ASU became effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The ASU permits the use of either a full or modified retrospective method of adoption. The Company does not expect the adoption to have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, \"Business Combinations (Topic 805) - Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,\" which will require companies to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities relating to contracts with customers that are acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC\n64\nTopic 606. Under current GAAP, an acquirer generally recognizes assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination, including contract assets and contract liabilities arising from revenue contracts with customers, at fair value on the acquisition date. ASU No. 2021-08 will result in the acquirer recording acquired contract assets and liabilities on the same basis that would have been recorded by the acquiree before the acquisition under ASC Topic 606. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2022 on a prospective basis and the adoption impact of the new standard will depend on the magnitude of future acquisitions. The standard will not impact acquired contract assets or liabilities from business combinations occurring prior to the adoption date.\nIn November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, \"Government Assistance (Topic 832) – Disclosures by Business Entities about Government Assistance.\" This ASU requires disclosures that are expected to increase the transparency of transactions with a governmental entity accounted for by applying a grant or contribution accounting model by analogy, including disclosures around: (1) the types of transactions, (2) the accounting for those transactions, and (3) the effect of those transactions on an entity’s financial statements. The ASU is effective for the Company on January 1, 2022, including interim periods, with early adoption permitted. The Company adopted this ASU as of January 1, 2022 on a prospective basis and does not expect it to have a material impact on its financial statements and disclosures.\n2.\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nIn January 2022 the Company began using LMR Communications, eliminating the \"Mission Critical\" descriptor from LMR Mission Critical Communications, to enhance investor understanding; this name change does not require any financial information to be reclassified from previous periods.\nThe following table summarizes the disaggregation of our revenue by segment, geography, major product and service type and customer type for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, consistent with the information reviewed by our chief operating decision maker for evaluating the financial performance of reportable segments:\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the revenue that is expected to be recognized in future periods related to performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of the end of a period. The transaction value associated with remaining performance obligations which were not yet satisfied as of December 31, 2021 was $\n9.2\nbillion. A total of $\n4.0\nbillion was from Products and Systems Integration performance obligations that were not yet satisfied, of which $\n2.2\nbillion is expected to be recognized in the next\ntwelve months\n. The remaining amounts will generally be satisfied over time as systems are implemented. A total of $\n5.2\nbillion was from Software and Services performance obligations that were not yet satisfied as of December 31, 2021. The determination of Software and Services performance obligations that are not satisfied takes into\n65\naccount a contract term that may be limited by the customer’s ability to terminate for convenience. Where termination for convenience exists in the Company's services contracts, its disclosure of the remaining performance obligations that are unsatisfied assumes the contract term is limited until renewal. The Company expects to recognize $\n1.6\nbillion from unsatisfied Software and Services performance obligations over the next\ntwelve months\n, with the remaining performance obligations to be recognized over time as services are performed and software is implemented.\nPayment terms on system contracts are typically tied to implementation milestones associated with progress on contracts, while revenue recognition is over time based on a cost-to-cost method of measuring performance. The Company may recognize a contract asset or contract liability, depending on whether revenue has been recognized in excess of billings or billings in excess of revenue. Services contracts are typically billed in advance, generating Contract liabilities until the Company has performed the services. The Company does not record a financing component to contracts when it expects, at contract inception, that the period between the transfer of a promised good or service and related payment terms are less than a year.\nContract Balances\nRevenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2021 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of January 1, 2021 was $\n1.0\nbillion, compared to $\n946\nmillion of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of January 1, 2020, and $\n854\nmillion of revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 which was previously included in Contract liabilities as of January 1, 2019. Revenue of $\n4\nmillion was reversed during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to performance obligations satisfied, or partially satisfied, in previous periods, primarily driven by changes in the estimates of progress on system contracts, compared to $\n53\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n50\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThere have been\nno\nmaterial expected credit losses recognized on contract assets during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nContract Cost Balances\nContract cost assets represent incremental costs to obtain a contract, primarily related to the Company's sales incentive plans, and certain costs to fulfill contracts. Contract cost assets are amortized into expense over a period that follows the passage of control to the customer over time. Incremental costs to obtain a contract with the Company's sales incentive plans are accounted for under a portfolio approach, with amortization ranging from\none year\nto\neight years\nto approximate the recognition of revenues over time. Where incremental costs to obtain a contract will be recognized in one year or less, the Company applies a practical expedient around expensing amounts as incurred. Amortization of contract cost assets was $\n52\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, compared to $\n49\nmillion as of the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n42\nmillion as of the year ended December 31, 2019.\n66\n3.\nLeases\nThe Company leases certain office, factory and warehouse space, land and other equipment, principally under non-cancelable operating leases.\nComponents of Lease Expense\nLease Assets and Liabilities\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company exercised a break option reducing the term of an International office lease by\nfive years\n. This resulted in a reduction to both the Operating lease asset and Operating lease liabilities by approximately $\n47\nmillion.\nOther Information Related to Leases\n67\nFuture Lease Payments\n4.\nOther Financial Data\nStatement of Operations Information\nOther Charges (Income)\nOther charges (income) included in Operating earnings consist of the following:\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $\n10\nmillion of operating lease impairments primarily relating to the consolidation of acquired U.S. manufacturing and distribution facilities. This loss has been recognized in Other charges in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations. During 2020, the Company recorded a $\n50\nmillion gain on the sale of a manufacturing facility in Europe.\n68\nOther Income (Expense)\nInterest expense, net, and Other both included in Other income (expense) consist of the following:\nEarnings Per Common Share\nBasic and diluted earnings per common share from net earnings attributable to Motorola Solutions, Inc. are computed as follows:\nIn the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2021, the assumed exercise of\n0.2\nmillion options, including\n0.1\nmillion subject to market-based contingent option agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2020, the assumed exercise of\n0.4\nmillion options, including\n0.1\nmillion subject to market-based contingent option agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive. In the computation of diluted earnings per common share for the year ended December 31, 2019, the assumed exercise of\n0.3\nmillion options, including\n0.1\nmillion subject to market-based contingent option agreements, were excluded because their inclusion would have been antidilutive.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n1.0\nbillion of\n1.75\n% senior convertible notes outstanding which mature on September 15, 2024 (\"Senior Convertible Notes\"). The notes became fully convertible as of September 5, 2021. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 4.9140 per $1,000 principal amount (which is equal to an initial conversion price of $\n203.50\nper share), adjusted for dividends declared through the date of settlement. In November 2021, the Company's Board of\n69\nDirectors approved an irrevocable determination requiring the future settlement of the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes to be settled in cash. Because the company has irrevocably decided to settle the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes in cash, the Company did not reflect any shares underlying the Senior Convertible Notes in its diluted weighted average shares outstanding until the average stock price per share for the period exceeded the conversion price, which first occurred for the year ended December 31, 2021. The Company included the number of shares that would be issuable upon conversion (under the treasury stock method of accounting for share dilution) in the Company’s computation of diluted earnings per share, based on the amount by which the average stock price exceeded the conversion price for the period ended December 31, 2021. The value by which the Senior Convertible Notes exceeded their principal amount if converted as of December 31, 2021 was $\n286\nmillion. Refer to \"Note 5: Debt and Credit Facilities\" for a further discussion of the Senior Convertible Notes.\nBalance Sheet Information\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net, consists of the following:\nInventories, Net\nInventories, net, consist of the following:\nOther Current Assets\nOther current assets consist of the following:\nProperty, Plant and Equipment, Net\nProperty, plant and equipment, net, consist of the following:\nDepreciation expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n202\nmillion, $\n194\nmillion and $\n186\nmillion, respectively.\n70\nInvestments\nInvestments consist of the following:\nThe Company’s common stock portfolio reflects investments in publicly-traded companies within the communications services sector and is valued utilizing active market prices for similar instruments. During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company paid $\n50\nmillion for equity securities of NewHold Investment Corp. (\"NHIC\"), a special purpose acquisition company (\"SPAC\") that completed a business combination with Evolv Technologies, Inc. After the business combination, NHIC was renamed “Evolv Technologies Holdings, Inc.” (together with its subsidiaries, “Evolv”). During the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized a loss of $\n30\nmillion in Other income (expense) related to a decrease in the fair value of the investment.\nStrategic investments include investments in non-public technology-driven startup companies. Strategic investments do not have a readily determinable fair value and are recorded at cost, less any impairment, and adjusted for changes resulting from observable, orderly transactions for identical or similar securities. The Company did not recognize any significant adjustments to the recorded cost basis during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company recorded a gain on the sale of investments and businesses of $\n1\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021, a loss on the sale of investments and businesses of $\n2\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and a gain on sale of investments and businesses of $\n5\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded\nno\ninvestment impairment charges, compared to $\n4\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020 and $\n18\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2019, representing other-than-temporary declines in the value of the Company’s strategic equity investment portfolio.\nOther Assets\nOther assets consist of the following:\nAccrued Liabilities\nAccrued liabilities consist of the following:\n71\nOther Liabilities\nOther liabilities consist of the following:\nStockholders’ Equity Information\nShare Repurchase Program:\nThrough a series of actions, including approval in May 2021 to increase the authorized amount by $\n2.0\nbillion, the Board of Directors has authorized the Company to repurchase in the aggregate up to $\n16.0\nbillion of its outstanding shares of common stock (the “share repurchase program”). The share repurchase program does not have an expiration date. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had used approximately $\n13.9\nbillion of the share repurchase authority, including transaction costs, to repurchase shares, leaving $\n2.1\nbillion of authority available for future repurchases.\nThe Company's share repurchases, including transaction costs, for 2021, 2020, and 2019 can be summarized as follows:\nPayment of Dividends:\nOn November 18, 2021, the Company announced that its Board of Directors approved an increase in the quarterly cash dividend from $\n0.71\nper share of common stock to $\n0.79\nper share of common stock.\nDuring the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company paid $\n482\nmillion, $\n436\nmillion, and $\n379\nmillion, respectively, in cash dividends to holders of its common stock. On January 14, 2022, the Company paid an additional $\n134\nmillion in cash dividends to holders of its common stock.\n72\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe following table displays the changes in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, including amounts reclassified into income, and the affected line items in the Consolidated Statements of Operations during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019:\n73\n5.\nDebt and Credit Facilities\nLong-Term Debt\nOn September 5, 2019, in connection with the Company's repurchase and settlement of the outstanding principal amount of\n2.00\n% senior convertible notes due 2020 issued to Silver Lake Partners, the Company entered into an agreement with Silver Lake Partners to issue the Senior Convertible Notes. Interest on these notes is payable semiannually. The notes became fully convertible as of September 5, 2021. The notes are convertible based on a conversion rate of 4.9140 per $1,000 principal amount (which is equal to an initial conversion price of $\n203.50\nper share). The Company recorded a debt liability associated with the Senior Convertible Notes by determining the fair value of an equivalent debt instrument without a conversion option. Using a discount rate of\n2.45\n%, which was determined based on a review of relevant market data, the Company calculated the debt liability to be $\n986\nmillion, indicating a $\n14\nmillion discount to be amortized over the expected life of the debt instrument. As of December 31, 2021, the debt discount had been fully amortized as a component of interest expense. In November 2021, the Company's Board of Directors approved an irrevocable determination requiring the future settlement of the principal amount of the Senior Convertible Notes to be settled in cash\n.\nIn August of 2020, the Company issued $\n900\nmillion of\n2.30\n% senior notes due 2030. The Company recognized net proceeds of $\n892\nmillion after debt issuance costs and debt discounts. A portion of these proceeds were then used to redeem $\n552\nmillion in principal amount outstanding of the\n3.75\n% senior notes due 2022 for a redemption price of $\n582\nmillion, excluding $\n7\nmillion of accrued interest. The remaining proceeds were used to repurchase $\n293\nmillion in principal amount outstanding of its long-term debt under a tender offer, for a purchase price of $\n315\nmillion, excluding $\n5\nmillion of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discounts, the Company recognized a loss of $\n56\nmillion related to the redemption and the repurchase in Other, net within Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIn May of 2021, the Company issued $\n850\nmillion of\n2.75\n% senior notes due 2031. The Company recognized net proceeds of $\n844\nmillion after debt issuance costs. A portion of these proceeds were then used to redeem $\n324\nmillion in principal amount of the\n3.5\n% senior notes due 2023 for a purchase price of $\n341\nmillion, excluding $\n3\nmillion of accrued interest. After accelerating the amortization of debt discounts and debt issuance costs, the Company recognized a loss of $\n18\nmillion related to the redemption in Other, net within Other income (expense) in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company has an unsecured commercial paper program, backed by the 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement (defined below), under which the Company may issue unsecured commercial paper notes up to a maximum aggregate principal amount of $\n2.2\nbillion outstanding at any one time. At maturity, the notes are paid back in full including the interest component. The notes are not redeemable prior to maturity. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had\nno\noutstanding debt under the commercial paper program.\nAggregate requirements for long-term debt maturities during the next five years are as follows: 2022—$\n5\nmillion; 2023—$\n1\nmillion; 2024—$\n1.6\nbillion; 2025—$\n322\nmillion; and 2026—the Company does\nno\nt have any long-term debt maturities.\nCredit Facilities\nOn March 24, 2021, the Company entered into a $\n2.25\nbillion syndicated, unsecured revolving credit facility scheduled to mature in March 2026, which can be used for borrowing and letters of credit (the \"2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement\").\n74\nThe 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes a letter of credit sub-limit and fronting commitments of $\n450\nmillion. Borrowings under the facility bear interest at the prime rate plus the applicable margin, or at a spread above the London Interbank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\"), at the Company's option. The 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement includes provisions allowing the Company to replace LIBOR with a replacement benchmark rate in the future under certain conditions defined in the agreement. An annual facility fee is payable on the undrawn amount of the credit line. The interest rate and facility fee are subject to adjustment if the Company's credit rating changes. The Company must comply with certain customary covenants including a maximum leverage ratio, as defined in the 2021 Motorola Solutions Credit Agreement. The Company was in compliance with its financial covenants as of December 31, 2021.\n6.\nRisk Management\nForeign Currency Risk\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had outstanding foreign exchange contracts with notional amounts totaling $\n1.1\nbillion, compared to $\n1.2\nbillion outstanding at December 31, 2020. The Company does not believe these financial instruments should subject it to undue risk due to foreign exchange movements because gains and losses on these contracts should generally offset gains and losses on the underlying assets, liabilities and transactions.\nThe following table shows the Company's five largest net notional amounts of the positions to buy or sell foreign currency as of December 31, 2021 and the corresponding positions as of December 31, 2020:\nNet Investment Hedges\nThe Company uses foreign exchange forward contracts with contract terms of\n12\nto\n15\nmonths to hedge against the effect of the British pound and the Euro exchange rate fluctuations against the U.S. dollar on a portion of its net investment in certain European operations. The Company recognizes changes in the fair value of the net investment hedges as a component of foreign currency translation adjustments within other comprehensive income to offset a portion of the change in translated value of the net investment being hedged, until the investment is sold or liquidated. The Company has elected to exclude the difference between the spot rate and the forward rate of the forward contract from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The effect of the excluded components will be amortized on a straight-line basis and recognized through interest expense. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had €\n100\nmillion of net investment hedges in certain Euro functional subsidiaries and £\n100\nmillion of net investment hedges in certain British pound functional subsidiaries.\nCounterparty Risk\nThe use of derivative financial instruments exposes the Company to counterparty credit risk in the event of non-performance by counterparties. However, the Company’s risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments when the derivative is in an asset position. The Company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk. As of December 31, 2021, all of the counterparties had investment grade credit ratings. As of December 31, 2021, the credit risk with all derivative counterparties was approximately $\n7\nmillion.\n75\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nThe following tables summarize the fair values and location in the Consolidated Balance Sheet of all derivative financial instruments held by the Company at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe following table summarizes the effect of derivatives designated as hedging instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nThe following table summarizes the effect of derivatives not designated as hedging instruments, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n7.\nIncome Taxes\nComponents of Income Tax Expense\nComponents of earnings before income taxes are as follows:\n76\nComponents of income tax expense are as follows:\nDifferences between income tax expense computed at the U.S. federal statutory tax rate of 21% and income tax expense as reflected in the Consolidated Statements of Operations are as follows:\nThe effective tax rate for 2021 was below the current U.S. federal statutory rate of 21% primarily due to the partial release of the valuation allowance recorded on the U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward and the recognition of excess tax benefits of share-based compensation.\nDeferred tax balances that were recorded within Accumulated other comprehensive loss in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet, rather than Income tax expense, are the result of retirement benefit adjustments and currency translation adjustments. The adjustments were charges of $\n21\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021, benefits of $\n11\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020 and charges of $\n97\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2019.\nThe Company evaluates its permanent reinvestment assertions with respect to foreign earnings at each reporting period and generally, except for certain earnings that the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely due to the capital requirements of the foreign subsidiaries or due to local country restrictions, accrues for the U.S. federal and foreign income tax applicable to the earnings. As a result of the 2017 U.S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"the Tax Act\"), dividends from foreign subsidiaries are now exempt or the earnings have been previously subject to U.S. tax. As a result, the tax accrual for undistributed foreign earnings is limited primarily to foreign withholding taxes and tax on inherent capital gains that would result from distribution of foreign earnings which are not permanently reinvested, and such earnings may be distributed without an additional charge.\nUndistributed foreign earnings that the Company intends to reinvest indefinitely amounted to, in the aggregate, $\n1.5\nbillion at December 31, 2021. It is impracticable to determine the exact amount of unrecognized deferred tax liabilities on such earnings; however, due to the above-mentioned changes made under the Tax Act, the Company believes that the additional U.S. or foreign income tax charge with respect to such earnings, if distributed, would be immaterial.\nGross deferred tax assets were $\n2.0\nbillion and $\n2.1\nbillion for December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Deferred tax assets, net of valuation allowances, were $\n1.8\nbillion and $\n1.7\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Gross deferred tax liabilities were $\n1.0\nbillion and $\n926\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n77\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets (liabilities) are as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had valuation allowances of $\n275\nmillion and $\n341\nmillion, respectively, against its deferred tax assets, including $\n53\nmillion and $\n81\nmillion, respectively, relating to deferred tax assets for non-U.S. subsidiaries. The Company’s U.S. valuation allowance decreased $\n38\nmillion during 2021 primarily due to a change in the Company's ability to utilize U.S. foreign tax credits and the expiration of tax attributes. The Company's non-U.S. valuation allowance decreased $\n28\nmillion during 2021 primarily due to the expiration of tax attributes. The Company's valuation  allowance for U.S. and non-U.S. decreased $\n5\nmillion and $\n4\nmillion, respectively, during 2020 primarily due to the expiration of tax attributes. The Company believes that the remaining deferred tax assets are more-likely-than-not to be realizable based on estimates of future taxable income and the implementation of tax planning strategies.\nTax attribute carryforwards are as follows:\nThe Company had unrecognized tax benefits of $\n43\nmillion and $\n64\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, of which approximately $\n36\nmillion and $\n53\nmillion, if recognized, would have affected the effective tax rate for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n78\nA roll-forward of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:\nThe Company recorded $\n36\nmillion and $\n49\nmillion of unrecognized tax benefits in other liabilities at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\nThe Internal Revenue Service (\"IRS\") has concluded the examination of the Company's 2014 and 2015 tax years. The Company also has several state and non-U.S. audits pending.\nA summary of open tax years by major jurisdiction is presented below:\nAlthough the final resolution of the Company’s global tax disputes is uncertain, based on current information, in the opinion of the Company’s management, the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position or liquidity. However, an unfavorable resolution of the Company’s global tax disputes could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations in the periods, and as of the dates, on which the matters are ultimately resolved.\nBased on the potential outcome of the Company’s global tax examinations, the expiration of the statute of limitations for specific jurisdictions, or the continued ability to satisfy tax incentive obligations, it is reasonably possible that the unrecognized tax benefits will change within the next twelve months. The associated net tax impact on the effective tax rate, exclusive of valuation allowance changes, is estimated to be up to a $\n7\nmillion tax benefit.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n22\nmillion accrued for interest and $\n15\nmillion accrued for penalties on unrecognized tax benefits. At December 31, 2020, the Company had $\n33\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion accrued for interest and penalties, respectively, on unrecognized tax benefits. The Company's policy is to classify the interest and penalty as a component of interest expense and other expense, respectively.\n8.\nRetirement Benefits\nPension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plans\nU.S. Pension Benefit Plans\nThe Company’s non-contributory U.S. defined benefit plan (the \"U.S. Pension Plan\") provide benefits to U.S. employees hired prior to January 1, 2005, who became eligible after\none year\nof service. The Company also has an additional non-contributory supplemental retirement benefit plan, the Motorola Supplemental Pension Plan (\"MSPP\"), which provided supplemental benefits to individuals by replacing benefits that are lost by such individuals under the retirement formula due to application of the limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. In December 2008, the Company amended the U.S. Pension Plan and MSSP (together the \"U.S. Pension Benefit Plans\") such that, effective March 1, 2009: (i) no participant shall accrue any benefit or additional benefit on or after March 1, 2009, and (ii) no compensation increases earned by a participant on or after March 1, 2009 shall be used to compute any accrued benefit.\nIn December 2019, the Company completed a voluntary lump-sum election window offered to certain participants of the U.S. Pension Plan. The aggregate dollar amount of lump-sum elections by approximately\n6,300\nparticipants was $\n836\nmillion,\n79\nand accordingly, this amount was paid out of plan assets prior to December 31, 2019. These actions resulted in a reduction of the Company's projected benefit obligation, absent of actuarial losses experienced from decreases in interest rates, of $\n1.0\nbillion and a settlement loss of $\n359\nmillion recorded within “Other charges” on the Consolidated Statement of Operations.\nPostretirement Health Care Benefits Plan\nCertain health care benefits are available to eligible domestic employees hired prior to January 1, 2002 and meeting certain age and service requirements upon termination of employment (the “Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan”). As of January 1, 2005, the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan was closed to new participants. After a series of amendments, all eligible retirees under the age of\n65\nwill be provided an annual subsidy per household, versus per individual, toward the purchase of their own health care coverage from private insurance companies and for the reimbursement of eligible health care expenses. All eligible retirees over the age of\n65\nare entitled to one fixed-rate subsidy capped at $\n560\nper participant.\nThese series of amendments to the Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan resulted in a reduction in the postretirement benefit obligation. A substantial portion of the decrease related to prior service credits and was amortized as a credit to the Consolidated Statements of Operations over approximately\nfive years\n, or the period in which the remaining employees eligible for the plan qualify for benefits under the plan. These amendments were fully amortized during fiscal year 2021.\nNon-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans\nThe Company also provides defined benefit plans which cover non-U.S. employees in certain jurisdictions, principally the U.K. and Germany (the “Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans”). Other pension plans outside of the U.S. are not material to the Company either individually or in the aggregate.\nIn June 2015, the Company amended its non-U.S. defined benefit plan within the United Kingdom by closing future benefit accruals to all participants effective December 31, 2015.\nIn 2019, the Motorola Solutions United Kingdom defined benefit plan trustees decided to exercise their discretion on early retirement benefit reductions. This action resulted in a reduction of the projected benefit obligation of approximately $\n83\nmillion related to prior service credits that will be amortized as a credit to the Consolidated Statements of Operations over approximately\ntwenty-nine years\n, or the period in which the remaining employees eligible for the plan qualify for benefits under the plan.\nNet Periodic Cost (Benefit)\nThe net periodic cost (benefit) for pension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits plans was as follows:\n80\nThe status of the Company’s plans is as follows:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the primary driver of the decrease in the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans benefit obligation was higher actuarial gains due to an increase in the discount rate from\n2.63\n% as of December 31, 2020 to\n2.98\n% as of December 31, 2021, partially offset by increases in the benefit obligation due to demographic assumption updates. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the primary driver of the increase in the U.S. Pension Benefit Plans benefit obligation was higher actuarial losses due to a decrease in the discount rate from\n3.32\n% as of December 31, 2019 to\n2.63\n% as of December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the most significant drivers of the decrease in Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans benefit obligation were the higher actuarial gains coupled with favorable foreign exchange effects. The Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans incurred actuarial gains primarily due to increases in the discount rates from\n1.24\n% as of December 31, 2020 to\n1.82\n% as of December 31, 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the most significant drivers of the increase in Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans benefit obligation were the higher actuarial losses coupled with unfavorable foreign exchange effects. The Non-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans incurred actuarial losses primarily due to decreases in the discount rates from\n1.82\n% as of December 31, 2019 to\n1.24\n% as of December 31, 2020.\n81\nActuarial Assumptions\nCertain actuarial assumptions such as the discount rate and the long-term rate of return on plan assets have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic cost and the benefit obligation. The assumed discount rates reflect the prevailing market rates of a universe of high-quality, non-callable, corporate bonds currently available that, if the obligation were settled at the measurement date, would provide the necessary future cash flows to pay the benefit obligation when due. The long-term rates of return on plan assets represent an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, cash and other investments similar to the actual investment mix. In determining the long-term return on plan assets, the Company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the Company expects the plan funds to be invested.\nThe Company uses a full yield curve approach to estimate interest and service cost components of net periodic cost (benefit) for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement benefit plans. The full yield curve approach requires the application of the specific spot rate along the yield curve used in the determination of the projected benefit obligation to the relevant projected cash flows.\nThe Company used \"Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2021\" to calculate the 2021 U.S. projected benefit obligations and the \"Mortality Improvement Scale MP-2018\" to calculate the 2020 U.S. projected benefit obligations.\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine costs for the plans at the beginning of the fiscal year were as follows:\nWeighted average actuarial assumptions used to determine benefit obligations for the plans were as follows:\nThe following table presents the accumulated benefit obligation, projected benefit obligation and fair value of plan assets for our plans that have an accumulated benefit obligation and projected benefit obligation in excess of plan assets:\nInvestment Policy\nThe individual plans have adopted an investment policy designed to meet or exceed the expected rate of return on plan assets assumption. To achieve this, the plans retain professional advisors and investment managers that invest plan assets into various classes including, but not limited to: equity and fixed income securities, cash, cash equivalents, hedge funds, infrastructure/utilities, insurance contracts, leveraged loan funds and real estate. The Company uses long-term historical actual return experience with consideration of the expected investment mix of the plans’ assets, as well as future estimates of long-term investment returns, to develop its expected rate of return assumption used in calculating the net periodic cost. The individual plans have target mixes for these asset classes, which are readjusted periodically when an asset class weighting deviates from the target mix, with the goal of achieving the required return at a reasonable risk level.\n82\nThe weighted-average asset allocations by asset categories for all pension and the Postretirement Health Care Benefits plan were as follows:\nWithin the equity securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded securities including both domestic and foreign equities. Within the fixed income securities asset class, the investment policy provides for investments in a broad range of publicly-traded debt securities including: U.S. treasury issues, corporate debt securities, mortgage and asset-backed securities, as well as foreign debt securities. In the cash and other investments asset class, investments may include, but are not limited to: cash, cash equivalents, commodities, hedge funds, infrastructure/utilities, insurance contracts, leveraged loan funds and real estate.\nCash Funding\nThe Company made $\n3\nmillion of contributions to its U.S. Pension Benefit Plans during each of 2021 and 2020. The Company contributed $\n9\nmillion to its Non U.S. Pension Benefit Plans during 2021 and 2020. The Company made\nno\ncontributions to its Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan in 2021 or 2020.\nExpected Future Benefit Payments\nThe following benefit payments are expected to be paid:\nOther Benefit Plans\nSplit-Dollar Life Insurance Arrangements\nThe Company maintains a number of endorsement split-dollar life insurance policies on now-retired officers under a frozen plan. The Company had purchased the life insurance policies to insure the lives of employees and then entered into a separate agreement with the employees that split the policy benefits between the Company and the employee. Motorola Solutions owns the policies, controls all rights of ownership, and may terminate the insurance policies. To effect the split-dollar arrangement, Motorola Solutions endorsed a portion of the death benefits to the employee and upon the death of the employee, the employee’s beneficiary typically receives the designated portion of the death benefits directly from the insurance company and the Company receives the remainder of the death benefits. It is currently expected that minimal cash payments will be required to fund these policies.\nThe net periodic pension cost for these split-dollar life insurance arrangements was $\n5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The Company has recorded a liability representing the actuarial present value of the future death benefits as of the employees’ expected retirement date of $\n68\nmillion and $\n73\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.\n83\nDeferred Compensation Plan\nThe Company maintains a deferred compensation plan (“the Plan”) for certain eligible participants. Under the Plan, participants may elect to defer base salary and cash incentive compensation in excess of 401(k) plan limitations. Participants under the Plan may choose to invest their deferred amounts in the same investment alternatives available under the 401(k) plan (as defined below). The Plan also allows for Company matching contributions for the following: (i) the first\n4\n% of compensation deferred under the Plan, subject to a maximum of $\n50,000\nfor board officers, (ii) lost matching amounts that would have been made under the 401(k) plan if participants had not participated in the Plan, and (iii) discretionary amounts as approved by the Compensation and Leadership Committee of the board of directors.\nDefined Contribution Plan\nThe Company has various defined contribution plans, in which all eligible employees may participate. In the U.S., the Motorola Solutions 401(k) plan (the \"401(k) plan\") is a contributory plan. Matching contributions are based upon the amount of the employees’ contributions. The Company’s expenses for material defined contribution plans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n36\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion and $\n32\nmillion, respectively.\nDue to the economic uncertainties caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company took action in a number of areas to reduce its operating expenses, including by suspending all Company match contributions to the 401(k) plan for the period from May 15, 2020 through December 31, 2020, which were reinstated on January 1, 2021.\nUnder the 401(k) plan, the Company may make an additional discretionary matching contribution to eligible employees. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company made\nno\ndiscretionary contributions.\n9.\nShare-Based Compensation and Other Incentive Plans\nThe Company grants options and stock appreciation rights to acquire shares of common stock to certain employees and to existing option holders of acquired companies in connection with the merging of option plans following an acquisition. Each option and stock appreciation right granted has an exercise price of no less than\n100\n% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The awards have a contractual life of\nfive\nto\nten years\nand vest over\ntwo\nto\nthree years\n. In conjunction with a change in control, stock options and stock appreciation rights assumed or replaced with comparable stock options or stock appreciation rights only become exercisable if the holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or resigns for good reason within\n24\nmonths of a change in control.\nRestricted stock grants consist of shares or the rights to shares of the Company’s common stock which are awarded to certain employees. The grants are restricted in such that they are subject to vesting conditions; however, restricted stock holders have voting rights, and the rights to earn dividends on unvested shares.\nRestricted stock unit (“RSU”) grants consist of shares or the rights to shares of the Company’s common stock which are awarded to certain employees and non-employee directors. The grants are restricted such that they are subject to substantial risk of forfeiture and to restrictions on their sale or other transfer by the employee. In conjunction with a change in control, shares of RSUs assumed or replaced with comparable shares of RSUs will only have the restrictions lapse if the holder is also involuntarily terminated (for a reason other than cause) or resigns for good reason within\n24\nmonths of a change in control.\nPerformance-based stock options (“performance options”), market stock units (\"MSUs\"), and performance stock units (\"PSUs\") have been granted to certain Company executive officers. Performance options have a\nthree-year\nperformance period and are granted as a target number of units subject to adjustment based on company performance. Each performance option granted has an exercise price of no less than\n100\n% of the fair market value of the common stock on the date of the grant. The awards have a contractual life of\nten years\n. Shares ultimately issued for performance option awards granted are based on the actual total shareholder return (“TSR”) compared to the S&P 500 over the\nthree-year\nperformance period based on a payout factor that corresponds to actual TSR results as established at the date of grant. Vesting occurs on the third anniversary of the grant date. Under the terms of the MSUs, vesting is conditioned upon continuous employment until the vesting date and the payout factor is at least\n60\n% of the share price on the award date. The payout factor is the share price on vesting date divided by share price on award date, with a maximum of\n200\n%. The share price used in the payout factor is calculated using an average of the closing prices on the grant or vesting date, and the\n30\ncalendar days immediately preceding the grant or vesting date. Vesting occurs ratably over\nthree years\n. PSUs have been granted as a portion of the Long Range Incentive Plan (“LRIP”) awards issued to certain Company executive officers. The PSUs have a\nthree-year\nperformance period and were granted at a target number of units subject to adjustment based on company performance. The number of PSUs earned will be based on the actual TSR compared to the S&P 500 over the\nthree-year\nperformance period.\nOn August 25, 2015 and on March 9, 2017, the Company approved grants of performance-contingent stock options (“PCSOs”) to certain executive officers which were fully vested as of December 31, 2021. The August 25, 2015 awards have a\nseven-year\nterm and a per share exercise price of $\n68.50\n. The March 9, 2017 awards have a five-and-a-half-year term and a per share exercise price of $\n81.37\n.\nThe employee stock purchase plan allows eligible participants to purchase shares of the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions of up to\n20\n% of eligible compensation on an after-tax basis. Plan participants cannot purchase more than $\n25,000\nof stock in any calendar year. The price an employee pays per share is\n85\n% of the lower of the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the close of the first trading day or last trading day of the purchase period. The plan has\ntwo\npurchase periods, the first from October 1 through March 31 and the second from April 1 through September 30. For the years ended\n84\nDecember 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, employees purchased\n0.6\nmillion,\n0.7\nmillion and\n0.6\nmillion shares, respectively, at purchase prices of $\n133.27\nand $\n160.11\n, $\n112.98\nand $\n107.18\n, and $\n108.96\nand $\n120.12\n, respectively.\nSignificant Assumptions Used in the Estimate of Fair Value\nThe Company calculates the value of each employee stock option, estimated on the date of grant, using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe weighted-average estimated fair value of employee stock options granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n41.57\n, $\n39.98\nand $\n29.14\n, respectively, using the following weighted-average assumptions:\nThe Company calculates the value of each performance option, MSU, and PSU using a Monte Carlo simulation option pricing model, estimated on the date of grant. The fair values of performance options, MSUs, and PSUs granted during 2021 were $\n60.42\n, $\n184.71\nand $\n203.57\n, respectively. The fair values of performance options, MSUs, and PSUs granted during 2020 were $\n77.82\n, $\n112.17\nand $\n233.96\n, respectively. The fair value of performance options, MSUs and PSUs granted during 2019 was $\n46.15\n, $\n138.00\nand $\n203.61\n, respectively.\nThe following assumptions were used for the calculations.\nThe Company uses the implied volatility for traded options on the Company’s stock as the expected volatility assumption in the valuation of stock options, performance options, MSUs, and PSUs. The selection of the implied volatility approach was based upon the availability of actively-traded options on the Company’s stock and the Company’s assessment that implied volatility is more representative of future stock price trends than historical volatility. At the conclusion of each three-year PSU and performance option cycle, the Company uses the historical volatility as the expected volatility to calculate the actual TSR compared to the S&P 500.\nThe risk-free interest rate assumption is based upon the average daily closing rates during the year for U.S. Treasury notes that have a life which approximates the expected life of the grant. The dividend yield assumption is based on the Company’s future expectation of dividend payouts. The expected life represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period for all option tranches.\nThe Company has applied forfeiture rates, estimated based on historical data, of\n10\n% to the stock option fair values calculated by the Black-Scholes option pricing model and\n15\n% to RSUs. These estimated forfeiture rates are applied to grants based on their remaining vesting term and may be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from these estimates.\n85\nThe following table summarizes information about the total stock options outstanding and exercisable under all stock option plans, at December 31, 2021 (in thousands, except exercise price and years):\nAs of December 31, 2021, the weighted average contractual life for options outstanding and exercisable was\nfour\nand\nthree years\n, respectively.\nCurrent Year Activity\nTotal share-based compensation activity was as follows (in thousands, except exercise price):\n* Inclusive of PCSO awards\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020,\n4.9\nmillion and\n5.9\nmillion shares, respectively, were available for future share-based award grants under the current share-based compensation plan, covering all equity awards to employees and non-employee directors.\n86\nTotal Share-Based Compensation Expense\nCompensation expense for the Company’s share-based compensation plans was as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had unrecognized compensation expense related to all share based awards of $\n162\nmillion, net of estimated forfeitures, expected to be recognized over the weighted average period of approximately\nthree years\nand $\n6\nmillion of unrecognized compensation expense related to the employee stock purchase plan that will be recognized over the remaining purchase period. The aggregate fair value of outstanding share based awards as of December 31, 2021 was $\n315\nmillion.\nCash received from stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan was $\n102\nmillion, $\n108\nmillion, and $\n114\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $\n186\nmillion, $\n149\nmillion, and $\n113\nmillion, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value for options outstanding and exercisable as of December 31, 2021 was $\n712\nmillion and $\n628\nmillion, respectively, based on a December 31, 2021 stock price of $\n271.09\nper share.\nMotorola Solutions Incentive Plans\nThe Company's incentive plans provide eligible employees with an annual payment, calculated as a percentage of an employee’s eligible earnings, in the year after the close of the current calendar year if specified business goals and individual performance targets are met. The expense for awards under these incentive plans for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n161\nmillion, $\n78\nmillion and $\n146\nmillion, respectively.\nLong-Range Incentive Plan\nThe LRIP rewards elected officers for the Company’s achievement of specified business goals during the period, based on a single performance objective measured over a\nthree-year\nperiod. The expense for those LRIP awards with cash settlement terms was $\n8\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n21\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 , respectively.\n10.\nFair Value Measurements\nInvestments and Derivatives\nThe fair values of the Company’s financial assets and liabilities by level in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 were as follows:\n87\nPension and Postretirement Health Care Benefits Plan Assets\nThe fair values of the various pension and postretirement health care benefits plans’ assets by level in the fair value hierarchy as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nU.S. Pension Benefit Plans\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Level 3 assets:\n88\nNon-U.S. Pension Benefit Plans\nPostretirement Health Care Benefits Plan\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value of the Level 3 assets:\n89\nThe following is a description of the categories of investments:\nEquities\n—\nA diversified portfolio of corporate common and preferred stocks.\nCommingled funds\n— A diversified portfolio of assets that includes corporate common and preferred stocks, emerging market and high-yield fixed income securities among others.\nGovernment fixed income securities\n—\nSecurities issued by municipal, domestic and foreign government agencies, index-linked government bonds as well as interest rate derivatives.\nCorporate fixed income securities\n—\nA diversified portfolio of primarily investment grade bonds issued by corporations.\nShort-term investment funds\n—\nInvestments in money market accounts and derivatives with a liquidity of less than 90 days.\nPrivate funds\n—\nA diversified portfolio of assets that includes private equity funds and private loans.\nLevel 1 investments include securities which are valued at the closing price reported on the active market in which the individual securities are traded. Level 2 investments consist principally of securities which are valued using independent third party pricing sources. Level 3 investments include securities with valuations derived from valuation techniques, in which one or more significant inputs are unobservable.  A variety of inputs are utilized by the independent pricing sources including market based inputs, binding quotes, indicative quotes, and ongoing redemption and subscription activity. Inputs may be weighted differently for any security, and not all inputs are used for each security evaluation.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n685\nmillion of investments in money market government and U.S. treasury funds (Level 1) classified as Cash and cash equivalents in its Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared to $\n448\nmillion at December 31, 2020. The money market funds had quoted market prices that are approximately at par.\nUsing quoted market prices and market interest rates, the Company determined that the fair value of long-term debt at December 31, 2021 was $\n6.2\nbillion (Level 2), compared to a face value of $\n5.7\nbillion. Since considerable judgment is required in interpreting market information, the fair value of the long-term debt is not necessarily indicative of the amount which could be realized in a current market exchange.\nAll other financial instruments are carried at cost, which is not materially different from the instruments’ fair values.\n11.\nLong-term Financing and Sales of Receivables\nLong-term Financing\nLong-term receivables consist of receivables with payment terms greater than twelve months, long-term loans and lease receivables under sales-type leases. Long-term receivables consist of the following:\nThe current portion of long-term receivables is included in Accounts receivable, net and the non-current portion of long-term receivables is included in Other assets in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company recognized interest income on long-term receivables of $\n1\nmillion for each of the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n90\nCertain purchasers of the Company's products and services may request that the Company provide long-term financing (defined as financing with a term greater than one year) in connection with the sale of products and services. These requests may include all or a portion of the purchase price of the products and services. The Company's obligation to provide long-term financing may be conditioned on the issuance of a letter of credit in favor of the Company by a reputable bank to support the purchaser's credit or a pre-existing commitment from a reputable bank to purchase the long-term receivables from the Company. The Company had outstanding commitments to provide long-term financing to third-parties totaling $\n56\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n78\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nSales of Receivables\nFrom time to time, the Company sells accounts receivable and long-term receivables to third-parties under one-time arrangements.\nThe following table summarizes the proceeds received from sales of accounts receivable and long-term receivables for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company may or may not retain the obligation to service the sold accounts receivable and long-term receivables.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had retained servicing obligations for $\n940\nmillion of long-term receivables, compared to $\n983\nmillion of long-term receivables at December 31, 2020. Servicing obligations are limited to collection activities of sold accounts receivables and long-term receivables.\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company utilized a cost-efficient receivable discounting facility, implemented in 2020, to neutralize the impact of increased payment terms under a renegotiated and extended long-term contract in Europe resulting in accounts receivable sales of $\n211\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021. The proceeds of the Company's receivable sales are included in \"Operating Activities\" within its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nCredit Quality of Long-Term Receivables and Allowance for Credit Losses\nAn aging analysis of financing receivables at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 is as follows:\nThe Company uses an internally developed credit risk rating system for establishing customer credit limits. This system is aligned with and comparable to the rating systems utilized by independent rating agencies.\n12.\nCommitments and Contingencies\nPurchase Obligations\nDuring the normal course of business, in order to manage manufacturing lead times and help ensure adequate component supply, the Company enters into agreements with contract manufacturers and suppliers that either allow it to procure inventory based upon criteria as defined by the Company or establish the parameters defining the Company’s requirements. In addition, we have entered into software license agreements which are firm commitments and are not cancellable.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company had entered into firm, non-cancelable, and unconditional commitments under such arrangements through 2026. The Company expects to make total payments of $\n336\nmillion under these arrangements as follows: $\n113\nmillion in 2022, $\n103\nmillion in 2023, $\n91\nmillion in 2024, $\n18\nmillion in 2025, and $\n11\nmillion in 2026.\n91\nThe Company outsources certain corporate functions, such as benefit administration and information technology-related services, under various contracts, the longest of which is expected to expire in 2025. The remaining payments under these contracts are approximately $\n24\nmillion over the remaining life of the contracts. However, these contracts can be terminated. Termination would result in a penalty substantially less than the remaining annual contract payments. The Company would also be required to find another source for these services, including the possibility of performing them in-house.\nLegal Matters\nOn March 14, 2017, the Company filed a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the \"Court\") against Hytera Communications Corporation Limited of Shenzhen, China; Hytera America, Inc.; and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. (collectively, \"Hytera\"), alleging trade secret theft and copyright infringement and seeking, among other things, injunctive relief, compensatory damages, and punitive damages. On February 14, 2020, the Company announced that a jury in the Court decided in the Company's favor in its trade secret theft and copyright infringement case. In connection with this verdict, the jury awarded the Company $\n345.8\nmillion in compensatory damages and $\n418.8\nmillion in punitive damages, for a total of $\n764.6\nmillion. The Court denied Hytera’s motion for a new trial on October 20, 2020. On December 17, 2020, the Court denied the Company’s motion for a permanent injunction, finding instead that Hytera must pay the Company a forward-looking reasonable royalty on products that use the Company’s stolen trade secrets. As the parties were unable to agree on a reasonable royalty rate, the Court entered an order favorable to the Company on December 15, 2021, and, consistent with the Company's requests, set royalty rates for Hytera's sale of relevant products from July 1, 2019 forward.  The Court also ordered the parties to jointly file by February 22, 2022, a proposed royalty agreement for the Court's review and approval.\nIn response to the Court's decision to award the Company $\n764.6\nmillion in compensatory and punitive damages, Hytera motioned for certain equitable relief. On January 8, 2021, the Court granted Hytera’s motion for certain equitable relief and reduced the $\n764.6\nmillion judgment award to $\n543.7\nmillion. That same day, the Court also granted the Company’s motion for pre-judgment interest. On August 10, 2021, the Court ruled that Hytera must pay the Company $\n51.1\nmillion in pre-judgment interest and $\n2.6\nmillion in costs. On March 25, 2021, the Court entered rulings favorable to the Company with respect to several of the Company's post-trial motions, including the Company's motion for attorneys' fees and its motion to require Hytera to turn over certain assets in satisfaction of the Company’s judgment award. On September 7, 2021, Hytera filed a notice of appeal of the Court’s judgment with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (the \"Court of Appeals\"). The parties have briefed a jurisdictional issue raised by the Court of Appeals in response to Hytera's notice of appeal and await the Court's determination. On September 29, 2021, the Company filed two additional motions with the Court, requesting the Court to reconsider its order denying the Company’s request for an injunction, and requesting that the Court enforce its ruling requiring Hytera to turn over certain assets in satisfaction of the Company's judgment award, or, in the alternative, hold Hytera in contempt. On October 15, 2021, the Court granted the Company’s request for $\n34.2\nmillion in attorneys’ fees against Hytera.\nSeparate from the Company's litigation with Hytera, on May 27, 2020, Hytera America, Inc. and Hytera Communications America (West), Inc. each filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California (the “Bankruptcy Court”). The Company filed motions in the Bankruptcy Court to dismiss the bankruptcy proceedings in July 2020. On January 22, 2021, the Bankruptcy Court entered an agreed order, allowing a partial sale of Hytera's U.S. assets in the bankruptcy proceedings. The proposed sale does not include Hytera inventory accused of including the Company’s intellectual property. On February 11, 2022, the Court entered an order to confirm the liquidation plan for the two Hytera entities.\nIndemnifications\nThe Company is a party to a variety of agreements pursuant to which it is obligated to indemnify the other party with respect to certain matters. In indemnification cases, payment by the Company is conditioned on the other party making a claim pursuant to the procedures specified in the particular contract, which procedures typically allow the Company to challenge the other party's claims. In some instances, the Company may have recourse against third parties for certain payments made by the Company.\nThe Company may provide indemnifications for losses that result from the breach of general warranties contained in certain commercial and intellectual property agreements. Historically, the Company has not made significant payments under these agreements.\n13.\nInformation by Segment and Geographic Region\nThe Company conducts its business globally and manages it through the following\ntwo\nsegments:\nProducts and Systems Integration:\nThe Products and Systems Integration segment offers an extensive portfolio of infrastructure, devices, accessories, video security devices and infrastructure, and the implementation and integration of such systems, devices, and applications. Within LMR Communications, the Company is a global leader in the two-way radio category, including the Company’s Project 25 (\"P25\"), Terrestrial Trunked Radio (\"TETRA\"), Digital Mobile Radio (\"DMR)\", as well as other professional and commercial radio (“PCR”) solutions. The Company provides LTE solutions for public safety, government and commercial users, including infrastructure and devices operating in 700 MHz, 900 MHz and Citizens' Broadband Radio Service (\"CBRS\") frequencies. The Company's Video Security and Access Control technology includes network video management infrastructure, fixed security and mobile video cameras (body-worn and in-vehicle) and access control solutions. The primary customers of the Products and Systems Integration segment are government, public safety and commercial customers who operate private communications networks and video security solutions and typically manage a mobile workforce. In 2021, the segment’s net sales were $\n5.0\nbillion, representing\n62\n% of the Company's consolidated net sales.\n92\nSoftware and Services:\nThe Software and Services segment provides a broad range of solution offerings for government, public safety and commercial customers. Software includes public safety and enterprise Command Center Software, unified communications applications, and video software solutions, delivered both on-premise and “as a service.” Services includes a continuum of service offerings beginning with repair, technical support and maintenance. More advanced technologies include monitoring, software updates and cybersecurity services. Managed services range from partial to full operation of customer-owned or Motorola Solutions-owned networks. In 2021, the segment’s net sales were $\n3.1\nbillion, representing\n38\n% of the Company's consolidated net sales.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, no single customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales.\nSegment Information\nThe following table summarizes Net sales and Operating earnings by segment:\nThe following table summarizes the Company's capital expenditures and depreciation expense by segment:\nThe Company's \"chief operating decision maker\" does not review or allocate resources based on segment assets.\nGeographic Area Information\nNet sales attributed to geographic area are predominately based on the ultimate destination of the Company's products and services.\n14.\nReorganization of Businesses\nThe Company maintains a formal Involuntary Severance Plan (the “Severance Plan”), which permits the Company to offer eligible employees severance benefits based on years of service and employment grade level in the event that employment is involuntarily terminated as a result of a reduction-in-force or restructuring. The Company recognizes termination benefits based on formulas per the Severance Plan at the point in time that future settlement is probable and can be reasonably estimated based on estimates prepared at the time a restructuring plan is approved by management. Exit costs consist of contractual lease terminations costs. At each reporting date, the Company evaluates its accruals for employee separation and exit costs to ensure the accruals are still appropriate. In certain circumstances, accruals are no longer needed because of efficiencies in carrying out the plans or because employees previously identified for separation resigned from the Company and did not receive severance, or were redeployed due to circumstances not foreseen when the original plans were approved. In these cases, the Company reverses accruals through the Consolidated Statements of Operations where the original charges were recorded when it is determined they are no longer needed.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019 the Company continued to implement various productivity improvement plans aimed at achieving long-term, sustainable profitability by driving efficiencies and reducing operating costs. During 2020, the Company accepted voluntary applications to its Severance Plan from a defined subset of employees within the United States. Voluntary applicants received termination benefits based on the formulas defined in the Severance Plan. However, termination benefits,\n93\nwhich are normally different based on employment level grade and capped at nine months of salary, were equalized for all employment level grades and capped at a full year’s salary for the voluntary applicants. The remainder of the initiatives impacted both of the Company’s segments and affected employees located in all geographic regions.\n2021 Charges\nDuring 2021, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $\n32\nmillion, including $\n8\nmillion of charges in Costs of sales and $\n24\nmillion of charges in Other charges in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in the $\n32\nmillion were charges of $\n42\nmillion for employee separation costs, partially offset by $\n10\nmillion of reversals of accruals no longer needed.\nThe following table displays the net charges incurred by segment:\nReorganization of Businesses Accruals\nEmployee Separation Costs\nAt January 1, 2021, the Company had an accrual of $\n79\nmillion for employee separation costs. The 2021 additional charges of $\n42\nmillion include severance costs for approximately\n600\nemployees, of which\n400\nwere direct employees and\n200\nwere indirect employees. The adjustments of $\n10\nmillion reflect reversals of accruals no longer needed. The $\n77\nmillion used in 2021 reflects cash payments to severed employees. The remaining accrual of $\n34\nmillion, which is included in Accrued liabilities in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021, is expected to be paid, primarily within one year to: (i) severed employees who have already begun to receive payments and (ii) approximately\n100\nemployees to be separated in 2022.\n2020 Charges\nDuring 2020, the Company recorded net reorganization of business charges of $\n86\nmillion, including $\n29\nmillion of charges in Costs of sales and $\n57\nmillion of charges under Other charges in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations. Included in the aggregate $\n86\nmillion were charges of $\n100\nmillion for employee separation costs and $\n2\nmillion for exit costs, partially offset by $\n16\nmillion of reversals of accruals no longer needed.\nThe following table displays the net charges incurred by segment:\nReorganization of Businesses Accruals\nEmployee Separation Costs\nAt January 1, 2020, the Company had an accrual of $\n78\nmillion for employee separation costs. The additional 2020 charges of $\n102\nmillion represent severance costs for approximately an additional\n1,200\nemployees, of which\n800\nwere direct employees and\n400\nwere indirect employees. The adjustments of $\n16\nmillion reflect reversals of accruals no longer needed. The $\n85\nmillion used in 2020 reflects cash payments to severed employees.
