Leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and confidently and efficiently build more effective portfolios.\nInvestors all over the world use our research-driven and technology-enabled tools and solutions to gain insights and improve transparency throughout their investment processes. Our tools and solutions help investors define their investment universe; inform and analyze their asset allocation and portfolio construction decisions; measure and manage portfolio performance and risk; implement sustainable, climate-focused and other investment strategies; conduct performance attribution; construct and manage exchange traded funds (“ETFs”) and other indexed financial products; and facilitate reporting to stakeholders.\nOur products and services include indexes; portfolio construction and risk management tools; environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) and climate solutions; and real estate market and transaction data and analysis. We are increasingly focused on open and flexible technology, and our content and capabilities can be accessed by our clients through multiple channels and platforms.\nWe aim to anticipate the needs of the investment industry with our client-centric focus and our deep understanding of our clients’ workflows, challenges and goals. We are focused on product innovation and data collection to address the evolving needs of an increasingly complex industry. In order to most effectively serve our clients, we are committed to advancing an integrated approach to our offerings, achieving service excellence, enhancing our differentiated research and content, and delivering flexible, cutting-edge technology.\nClients\nOur clients comprise a wide spectrum of the global investment industry and include the following key client types:\nAs of December 31, 2021, we served over 6,300 clients\n1\nin more than 95 countries. For the year ended December 31, 2021, our largest client organization by revenue, BlackRock, accounted for 12.7% of our total revenues, with 93.6% of the revenue from BlackRock coming from fees based on the assets in BlackRock’s ETFs that are based on our indexes.\n2\nIndustry Trends and Competitive Advantages\nWe believe we are uniquely positioned to benefit from emerging trends and to help our clients adapt to a large and rapidly expanding and evolving investment industry. Investing has grown in complexity, with more choices across asset classes, security types and geographies, and more consideration of a wider array of risks, including those related to ESG and climate. In addition, the construction and management of investment portfolios are becoming increasingly outcome-oriented, rules-based and technology-driven. As a result, the investment process is transforming, reflected in several trends we have observed, including:\nWe believe the following competitive advantages position us well to meet client demands in light of these trends:\n3\nStrategy\nWe provide critical tools and solutions that enable investors to manage the transformations taking place in the investment industry, better understand performance and risk, and build portfolios more effectively and efficiently to achieve their investment objectives.\nWe are focused on the following key initiatives to deliver actionable and integrated client solutions:\n4\nFinancial Model\nWe have an attractive financial model due to our recurring revenue and strong cash generation. Clients purchase our products and services primarily through recurring fixed and variable fee arrangements, a business model which has historically delivered stable revenue and predictable cash flows. Finally, our disciplined capital-allocation policy provides us with flexibility to balance internal resources and investment needs, acquisitions and shareholder returns through dividends and opportunistic share repurchases.\nSee Part II, Item 7. “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview” and Note 1, “Introduction and Basis of Presentation—\nSignificant Accounting\nPolicies\n—\nRevenue Recognition\n,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for information on how we generate revenue and our revenue recognition policy.\nSegments\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, we had the following five operating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Estate and The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”), which are presented as the following four reportable segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, and All Other – Private Assets. For reporting purposes, the Real Estate and Burgiss operating segments are combined and presented as All Other – Private Assets, as they did not meet the thresholds for separate presentation. The Burgiss operating segment represents the Company’s equity method investment in Burgiss. Financial results related to MSCI’s acquisition of RCA have been included prospectively as a component of the Real Estate operating segment and presented as a component of the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment, commencing as of September 13, 2021 (the date we completed the acquisition).\nIndex\nClients use our indexes in many areas of the investment process, including for indexed product creation (\ne.g.\n, ETFs, mutual funds, annuities, futures, options, structured products, over-the-counter derivatives), performance benchmarking, portfolio construction and rebalancing,\nand asset allocation.\nWe currently calculate more than 267,000\n2\nend-of-day indexes daily and more than 15,000 indexes in real time\n. Clients receive index data directly from us or from third-party vendors worldwide.\nOur index product offerings include:\n5\nIn 2021,\nwe launched a number of new indexes, including the following:\nOur Index segment also includes revenues from licenses of\nGICS and GICS Direct\n, the global industry classification standard jointly developed and maintained by MSCI and Standard & Poor’s Financial Services, LLC, a subsidiary of S&P Global Inc.  This classification system was developed in response to investors’ need for a comprehensive and consistent framework for classifying companies into industries. GICS is widely accepted as an industry analysis framework for investment research, portfolio management and asset allocation. GICS Direct is a dataset comprised of active companies and securities classified by sector, industry group, industry and sub-industry in accordance with the proprietary GICS methodology. The\nMSCI Sector Indexes\nare comprised of GICS sector, industry group, and industry indexes across countries and regions in Developed, Emerging and select Frontier markets.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 61.3% of our revenues were attributable to our Index segment. A majority of those revenues were attributable to\nannual, recurring subscriptions. A portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexed investment products. Such fees are primarily based on a client’s assets under management (“AUM”) or trading volumes and are referred to herein as asset-based fees. Since market movement and investment trends impact our asset-based fees, our revenues from asset-based fees are subject to volatility. For the year ended December 31, 2021,\nasset-based fees accounted for 44.3% of the total revenues for our Index segment.\nAnalytics\nOur Analytics segment offers risk management, performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return and tools for analyzing market, credit, liquidity, counterparty and climate risk across all major asset classes, spanning short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. Our offerings also support clients’ various regulatory reporting needs.\nOur Analytics tools and capabilities include the following: models to support factor-based analytics (\ne.g.\n,\nBarra\nequity models and fixed income and multi-asset class (“MAC”) models), pricing models and single security analytics, time series-based analytics, stress testing, performance attribution, portfolio optimization and liquidity risk analytics, as well as underlying inputs such as interest rate and credit curves. We continue to develop new and improved tools and capabilities in response to the evolving needs of our clients. In addition, our analytics capabilities are helping to fuel growth in key areas across our business, such as our factor indexes and many of our climate risk and reporting offerings.\n6\nOur clients access our Analytics tools and content through our proprietary applications and application programming interfaces (“APIs”), third-party applications or directly through their own platforms.\nOur Analytics solutions provide clients with tools to construct and manage portfolios, including integrated market data from multiple third parties as well as content from MSCI’s other segments\n, which significantly reduces the operational burden on clients to independently source this information and populate it in our Analytics products. Our key Analytics products include:\nOur Analytics segment also provides various managed services to help clients operate more efficiently, including consolidation of client portfolio data from various sources, review and reconciliation of input data and results, and customized reporting. In addition, our\nRiskMetrics\nHedgePlatform service allows clients such as funds of funds, pension funds and endowments who invest in hedge funds to measure, evaluate and monitor the risk of their hedge fund investments across multiple hedge fund strategies.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 26.6% of our revenues were attributable to our Analytics segment.\nESG and Climate\nThe ESG and Climate segment\n3\noffers products and services that help institutional investors understand how ESG and climate considerations can impact the long-term risk and return of their portfolio and individual security-level investments. We provide data, ratings, research and tools to help investors navigate increasing regulation, meet new client demands and better integrate ESG and climate elements into their investment processes.\n7\nOur ESG and Climate research team analyzes over 9,800\n4\nentities worldwide, and we will continue to expand and deepen our coverage to help investors and others in their asset allocation, portfolio construction and risk management processes. Clients include global asset managers, leading asset owners, consultants, advisers, corporates and academics.\nOur ESG and Climate offerings include:\nMSCI ESG ratings and certain other ESG and climate data provided to our clients are also made available to, and used in, our other operating segments, such as in the construction of MSCI ESG and climate equity and fixed income indexes. These Index products are designed to help institutional investors more effectively benchmark ESG investment performance, issue indexed investment products, as well as manage, measure and report on ESG mandates.\nFor a description of regulation applicable to MSCI ESG Research LLC, see\n“—Government Regulation” below.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 8.1% of our revenues were attributable to our ESG and Climate segment.\nAll Other – Private Assets\nFor reporting purposes, our Real Estate and Burgiss operating segments are combined and presented as All Other – Private Assets.\nOur Real Estate offerings include real estate market and transaction data, benchmarks, return-analytics, climate assessments and market insights for funds, investors, managers and other real estate market participants. In September 2021, we completed our acquisition of RCA to meaningfully accelerate our Private Asset strategy. RCA’s rich transaction and pricing data enhances our offering to clients and allows us to integrate this information in other MSCI products including indexes, climate risk models and other MSCI solutions.\nOur Real Estate performance and risk analytics range from enterprise-wide to property-specific analytics. We also provide business intelligence products to real estate owners, managers, developers and brokers worldwide. Some of the risk analytics generated as part of our Real Estate offerings are also used in the products offered by our other operating segments.\n8\nOur Real Estate offerings include:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 4.0% of our revenues were attributable to our Real Estate offerings.\nResearch and Product Development\nWe apply an integrated team approach to developing content across our operating segments. Our product management, research and product development, data operations and technology, and application development departments are at the center of this process. Our content is developed by a research and product development team comprised of mathematicians, economists, statisticians, financial engineers and investment industry experts.  Content created in one segment can often be used for the creation of products in another segment.\nFor example, the MAC models created in our Analytics segment offer a view of risk across market and asset classes, including private real estate, by incorporating content generated in the Real Estate segment, and MSCI ESG indexes and our new Climate Lab Enterprise analytics product are constructed using data from our ESG and Climate segment.\nThrough our relationships with the world’s largest investment institutions, we monitor investment trends and their drivers globally and support instrument valuation, risk modeling, portfolio construction, portfolio attribution, asset allocation and VaR simulation. An important way we monitor global investment trends and their implications for our business is through direct public consultations and client advisory panels and through the forum provided by our Advisory Council. Our Advisory Council typically meets twice during the year to discuss current and emerging investment industry trends and is comprised of senior investment professionals from around the world and senior members of our research and product development team.\nTechnology\nTechnology plays a pivotal role in our operations and our ability to innovate and launch products and services. Current areas of focus include:\n9\nCompetition\nIndex.\nMany industry participants compete with us by offering one or more indexes in similar categories. Such indexes vary widely in scope, including by geographic region, business sector and weighting methodology, and may be used by clients in a variety of ways in many different markets around the world.  Among our Index competitors are S&P Dow Jones Indices LLC (a joint venture of S&P Global Inc. and CME Group Inc.); FTSE Russell, a subsidiary of the London Stock Exchange Group PLC; and Solactive AG.\nCompetition also exists from industry participants, including asset managers and investment banks, that create their own indexes, often in cooperation with index providers, which may, among other things, provide some form of calculation agent service. Some asset managers also manage funds, including ETFs, based on their proprietary indexes, and some investment banks launch structured products or create over-the-counter derivatives based on their proprietary indexes. This is often referred to as self-indexing.\nAnalytics.\nOur Analytics offerings compete with those from a range of competitors, including Qontigo\n(formerly Axioma Inc.)\n, BlackRock Solutions, Bloomberg Finance\nL.P., and FactSet Research Systems Inc. Additionally, some of the larger broker-dealers have developed proprietary analytics tools for their clients. Similarly, some of the large global investment organizations, such as custodians, have developed internal risk management and performance analytics tools that they offer to their clients.\nESG and Climate.\nOur ESG and Climate offerings compete with a growing number of companies that issue ESG data, ratings or research. For example, our ESG and Climate offerings compete with those from a range of competitors, including Sustainalytics Holding B.V. (a part of Morningstar, Inc.), Institutional Shareholder Services Inc. (majority owned by Deutsche Börse AG), Trucost (an S&P Global Inc. business) and Refinitiv (a London Stock Exchange Group business).\nAll Other\n– Private Assets\n.\nWe also have a variety of competitors for our other offerings that comprise a smaller portion of our revenues, including a growing number of companies that provide data, market intelligence, indexes, and performance and risk attribution services relating to real estate and other private assets.\nIntellectual Property, Other Proprietary Rights and Sources of Data\nWe consider many aspects of our offerings, processes and services to be proprietary. We have registered “MSCI” and other marks as trademarks or service marks in the United States and in certain other countries. We will continue to evaluate the registration of additional trademarks and service marks as appropriate. From time to time, we have also filed patent applications to protect our proprietary rights. Additionally, many of our offerings, processes and services require the use of intellectual property that we license for use from third parties. It may be necessary in the future to seek or renew licenses relating to various aspects of our offerings and services. Our ownership and protection of intellectual property and other proprietary rights and our ability to obtain the rights to use third-party intellectual property are important to our business and contribute in part to our overall success.\nIn addition to our intellectual property, we rely on third-party data to create and deliver our products and services. For example, we require certain stock exchange data to construct equity indexes.\nTermination of or\n10\ndisputes regarding our rights to receive or use\nsuch data could\nlimit\nthe information available for us\nto\nuse or\ndistribute in connection with our products and services\n.\nCorporate Responsibility\nAs a leader in providing ESG and climate solutions to investors, we also aim to demonstrate leading corporate responsibility practices and policies that are meaningful to our various stakeholders, including our clients, employees, shareholders and local communities. The Governance and Corporate Responsibility Committee of our Board of Directors provides oversight of our corporate responsibility strategy and activities.\nRecently we have implemented initiatives to reduce our impact on the environment and promote sustainability. We are committed to continuing to develop and enhance our climate-focused strategies. As part of our corporate responsibility efforts, in 2021 we\npublished our first United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) report and our first Sustainable Finance Disclosure Regulations (SFDR) report. We have also published a Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) report, a Sustainability Accounting Standard Board (SASB) report and a Climate Disclosure Project (CDP) report.\nAdditional information on our corporate responsibility efforts, including our net-zero commitment and carbon-reduction initiatives, can be found on our website at\nhttps://www.msci.com/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility\n.\nInformation contained on our website is not deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the SEC.\nHuman Capital Management\nMSCI is committed to creating a performance culture with high employee engagement. Our talent and leadership development programs are designed to ensure we have the people and skills in place to deliver on MSCI’s strategy, including a workplace that values and promotes diversity, equity and inclusion.\nThe Compensation, Talent and Culture Committee of our Board of Directors has oversight over talent management matters, including efforts relating to our corporate culture, progression planning, career progression and retention strategies, and learning and leadership development programs. In addition, our Chief Human Resources Officer and our Chief Diversity Officer report to our Board on our initiatives on diversity, equity and inclusion. We also engage with our shareholders around our talent initiatives, including our efforts to strengthen and promote a culture of inclusion and diversity.\nThe Board periodically reviews our executive talent including our leadership bench and succession planning. Our CEO and President also meet regularly with our functions to review talent plans with an aim to identify top talent who have the most potential to progress to the senior-most roles at MSCI.\nIn January 2022, following an extensive organizational design assessment conducted in 2021, we announced a number of organization and senior leadership changes, as well as expanded our Executive Committee to reflect MSCI’s ambition to serve as an indispensable partner to clients and the investment community. This expansion brings together and elevates more of the senior leaders who drive MSCI’s strategy and operations into MSCI’s primary leadership committee. The new members of the Executive Committee increase the representation from operating functions, in particular, Research, Technology and Data, and Private Assets. Additional information on our Executive Committee can be found be found at https://www.msci.com/who-we-are/our-leadership. Information contained on our website is not deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the SEC.\nMSCI is a global company with a highly diverse footprint. As of December 31, 2021, we employed 4,303 people, of which 47.4% of MSCI employees were located in the Asia Pacific region, 23.3% in Europe, Middle East and Africa, 20.6% in the U.S. and Canada, and 8.7% in Mexico and Brazil.  For the one-year period ended December 31, 2021, voluntary turnover was 12.5% and involuntary turnover was 2.3%.\nDiversity, Equity and Inclusion\nAt MSCI, diversity, equity and inclusion are core values of our culture. We strive to empower our people to maximize their potential in an environment where all individuals are respected and encouraged to bring their authentic selves to work. This culture embraces diverse experiences and perspectives, which we believe foster\ncreativity\nand innovation. As of December 31, 2021, women represented 35.2% of our global employees, and people of color (defined as those who identify as Asian, Black or African American, Hispanic or Latino, American Indian\n11\nor Alaska Native\n,\nNative\nHawaiian\nor Other\nPacific Islander or two or more races) represented\n4\n6.1\n% of our U.S. employees\nand\n41.6\n% of our U.S. employees in\nmanagement\nroles\n5\n.\nT\nhe U.S. represents\n1\n9.9\n% of our global workforce\n.\nIn 2021, we appointed our first Chief Diversity Officer, who is responsible for operating across MSCI to align our diversity, equity and inclusion goals with business outcomes. Our Executive Diversity Council (the “EDC”) champions a diverse and inclusive culture by advising on corporate initiatives and facilitating collaboration across MSCI. Members of the EDC partner with our employee\nresource\ngroups (the Women’s Leadership Forum, Women in Tech, MSCI Pride, the Black Leadership Network, Asian Support Network (formed in 2021), All Abilities Network (formed in 2021) and Hola! MSCI (formed in 2021)) to raise awareness, conduct events around the globe and serve as sponsors in their respective locations.\nOur Employer Brand Council and the Diversity Engagement and Sourcing team focus on:\nThe team not only aims to create a pipeline of diverse talent for MSCI but also works to position MSCI more broadly as a leading organization that puts diversity, equity and inclusion at the center of its strategy. We believe that a diverse team is a stronger team and an important part of our success.\nAdditional information on our diversity metrics and programs can be found on our website at\nhttps://www.msci.com/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility/social-responsibility/diversity-\nequity-and-inclusion.\nInformation contained on our website is not deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the SEC.\nCompensation, Benefits and Well-being\nWe offer a broad range of highly competitive compensation and benefits programs to our employees and their families, including same-sex domestic partners. These programs include health and welfare benefits, including an Employee Assistance Program; enhanced maternity and paternity leave policies, including a Global Minimum Standard applicable to all offices worldwide; contributions to defined contribution and defined benefit pensions plans globally and Health Savings Accounts in the U.S.; life insurance; a global wellness initiative that can help employees improve their health and well-being; presentations on well-being topics, including retirement planning, parenting, meditation, stress management and nutrition; ergonomic equipment and desk assessments; and wellness rooms in all MSCI office locations.\nCompensation at MSCI supports a culture of high performance and accountability. Our goal is to provide competitive compensation in the markets where we compete for talent. We believe in linking all employee compensation to Company, Product/Function and individual performance by making 100% of our employees\neligible\nfor annual cash bonuses. We strongly differentiate cash bonus payouts based on actual results against goals and for managers, how effectively they demonstrate behaviors consistent with our values and culture.\nSenior employees of the Company and select other employees are eligible to participate in the MSCI Long-Term Incentive Program with awards of\nMSCI\nstock that vest over a multi-year period. The goal of the Long-Term Incentive Program is to: (i) align the interests of eligible employees with those of our shareholders, (ii) enhance our “owner-operator” philosophy, (iii) recognize and reward potential long-term contributions, (iv) retain key leaders and top performers.\nIn June 2020, MSCI announced an innovation initiative called the Future of Work at MSCI, and we began implementing this initiative in January 2022. For most of our employees, the Future of Work introduced a hybrid work environment allowing employees to work at times at the office and other times remotely, depending on the requirements of a specific role. As we continue to adapt and iterate how we work, employee feedback will remain central to this initiative.\nCultivating Talent and Employee Engagement\nMSCI is committed to investing in employee learning and development. Throughout the year, we offer tools and workshops\nto\nhelp employees better understand how their work aligns with MSCI’s overall strategy, seek and receive real-time and transparent feedback and coaching, successfully deliver on their goals, and more effectively plan and develop their careers.\nMSCI conducts an employee engagement survey at least annually that measures whether our approaches to performance, growth and career development are driving employee engagement. Managers receive anonymous feedback and are accountable for improving and enhancing the work environment to drive higher engagement.\nIn our December 2021 employee engagement survey, we achieved a 79% response rate and the percentage of respondents characterized as fully engaged equaled the highest since we implemented the engagement survey (not including employees from RCA, a newly acquired business).\nAdditional information on our\ntraining programs and engagement\nmetrics can be found on our website at\nhttps://www.msci.com/who-we-are/corporate-responsibility/social-responsibility/cultivating-talent\n. Information contained on our website is not deemed part of or incorporated by reference into this Annual Report on Form 10-K or any other report filed with the SEC.\nSupporting our Employees Through COVID-19\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has underscored for us the importance of keeping our employees safe and healthy. In response to the pandemic, we immediately implemented an employee communication strategy that was direct, transparent and inclusive. Through townhalls, firmwide e-mail communications and broad cross-functional meetings, management delivered key messages around employee safety and well-being, leadership, remaining productive, engaging with clients, promoting community and having empathy for others. We also increased communications around employee assistance programs that provide mental health and emotional\nwell\n-being support, and resources to help manage stress and care for individuals and their families. Finally, we paid for or reimbursed employees for the cost of COVID-19 testing and enhanced our sick leave policies.\nAt the outset of the COVID-19 pandemic our technology infrastructure allowed us to seamlessly transition to a remote work environment. We increased technology effectiveness to allow our employees to remain fully engaged, productive and well. We also provided individualized support and equipment to our employees as needed to facilitate productivity. We continue to closely monitor and manage the situation regarding the COVID-19 pandemic and follow the recommended practices and guidelines from the World Health Organization as well as local requirements where our offices are located globally.\nAs noted above, in January 2022, we transitioned to our Future of Work at MSCI, which introduced increased flexibility to how and where employees work, reimagined our use of our offices and modernized technology to enhance MSCI’s interactions with clients and employees. For most of our employees, the Future of Work introduced a hybrid work environment allowing employees to work flexibly, sometimes at the office and other times remotely, based on the requirements of their specific roles. The Future of Work at MSCI unites our inclusive culture with modern ways of working to give employees the accountability, responsibility and empowerment to perform at their very best, while keeping our clients at the center of all we do. We believe these efforts will be iterative and adaptable, and feedback from our employees will be critical to ensure this initiative remains relevant and positions MSCI and its employees for success.\n12\nGovernment Regulation\nThe Company is subject to reporting, disclosure and recordkeeping obligations pursuant to SEC req\nuirements applicable to U.S. public companies.\nPursuant to the European Union’s benchmark regulation, the United Kingdom’s Financial Conduct Authority (“UK FCA”) authorized MSCI Limited (a subsidiary of MSCI Inc.) to be the benchmark administrator for applicable MSCI indexes.\nInformation about index regulation is periodically updated on our website at\nhttps://www.msci.com/index-regulation\n.\nThe contents of our website, including this webpage, are not, however, a part of or incorporated by reference in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nMSCI ESG Research LLC is a registered investment adviser and must comply with the requirements of the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act”) and related SEC regulations.

    "text": "You should carefully consider the following risks and all of the other information set forth in this Annual Report on Form 10-K. If any of the following risks actually occurs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. You should read the section titled “Forward-Looking Statements” on page 1 for a description of the types of statements that are considered forward-looking statements, as well as the significance of such statements in the context of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. This information should be read in conjunction with \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Result of Operations\" and the consolidated financial statements and related notes. These factors could cause our future results to differ materially from our historical results and from expectations reflected in forward-looking statements.\nSummary of Risk Factors\nOur business is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties, discussed in more detail in the following section. These risks include\n, among others, the following key risks:\n15\nOperational Risks\nWe are dependent on third parties to supply data, applications and services for our products and services and are dependent on certain vendors to distribute our products. A refusal or failure by a key vendor to distribute our products or any loss of key outside suppliers of data, applications or services or a reduction in the accuracy or quality of such data, applications or services or any failure by us to comply with our suppliers’ or distributors’ licensing requirements could impair our ability to provide our clients with our products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe rely on third-party suppliers of data, applications and services, including data from stock exchanges (“Vendor Products”), and depend on the accuracy and quality of Vendor Products and the ability and willingness of such suppliers to deliver, support, enhance and develop new Vendor Products on a timely and cost-effective basis, and respond to emerging industry needs and other changes in order to produce, deliver and develop our products and services. Additionally, we depend on clients to supply certain data in order to provide our services to them. Any failure to supply, errors or reduction in the amount, accuracy or quality of such data supplied from clients impairs our ability to provide them with our products and services.\nIf Vendor Products include errors, design defects, are delayed, become incompatible with future versions of our products, are unavailable on acceptable terms or are not available at all, we may not be able to deliver our products and services. In addition, in the ordinary course suppliers of Vendor Products are subject to various forms of cyber-attacks. Breaches of our suppliers’ systems and networks may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or such suppliers’ websites, applications or data processing, or may compromise the confidentiality and integrity of affected information.\nSome of our agreements with third-party suppliers allow them to cancel on short notice and from time to time we receive notices from third-party suppliers threatening to terminate the provision of their products or services to us, and some data suppliers have terminated the provision of their data to us. Termination of the provision of Vendor Products by one or more of our significant suppliers or exclusion from, or restricted use of, or litigation in connection with Vendor Products could decrease the data and materials available for us to use and deliver to our clients. In addition, some of our competitors could enter into exclusive contracts with our data suppliers, including with certain stock exchanges. If our competitors enter into such exclusive contracts, we may be precluded from receiving certain data or other materials from these suppliers or restricted in our use of such data or other materials, which would give our competitors a competitive advantage. Such exclusive contracts could hinder our ability to create our products and services or to provide our clients with the data or other products or services they prefer, which could lead to a decrease in our client base.\nDespite our efforts to comply with the licensing requirements of Vendor Products, our use of certain Vendor Products has been challenged in the past and there can be no assurance that third parties may not challenge our use in the future, resulting in increased acquisition or licensing costs, loss of rights and/or costly legal actions. Our business could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to timely or effectively replace the data or functionality provided by Vendor Products that become unavailable or fail to operate effectively for any reason. Our operating costs could increase if additional license fees are imposed or current license fees increase or the efforts to incorporate enhancements to Vendor Products are substantial and we are unable to negotiate acceptable licensing arrangements with these suppliers or find alternative sources of equivalent products or services. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe also rely on certain third-party vendors to distribute our data to clients. While some of our vendors generate revenue in connection with distributing our data, others do not derive a direct financial benefit. Should any of our key vendors refuse to distribute our data for any reason or require that we pay them new or additional fees in connection with the distribution of our data, we would need to find alternative ways to distribute our data or lose revenue or profitability for certain products, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIf our products contain undetected errors or fail to perform properly due to defects, malfunctions or similar problems, we may, among other things, become subject to increased costs or liability based on the use of our products or services to support our clients’ investment processes, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur products and services support the investment processes of our clients, which relate to, in the aggregate, trillions of dollars in assets. Products or services we develop or license may contain undetected errors or defects despite testing or other quality assurance practices. Use of our products or services as part of the investment process\n16\ncreates the risk that our clients, the parties whose assets are managed by our clients\n, investors in investment products linked to our indexes,\nthe companies that we rate or assess in our ESG\nsolutions\nor the shareholders of those companies,\nmay pursue claims against us based on even a small error in our data, calculations, methodologies or analysis or a malfunction or failure in our systems, products or services.\nErrors or defects can exist at any point in a product’s lifecycle, but are frequently found after introduction of new products or services or enhancements to existing products. We continually introduce new methodologies and products, and new versions of and updates to our existing products or services. Despite internal testing and in some cases testing or use by clients, our products or services may contain errors in our data, calculations, methodologies or analysis, including serious defects or malfunctions. If we detect any errors before we release or deliver a product or service or publish a methodology or analysis, we might have to suspend or delay the product or service release or delivery for an extended period of time while we address the problem. We may not discover errors that affect our products or services or enhancements until after they are deployed, and we may need to provide enhancements or corrections to address such errors, and in certain cases it may be impracticable to do so. If undetected errors exist in our products or services, or if our products or services fail to perform properly due to defects, malfunctions or similar problems, it could result in harm to our brand or reputation, significantly increased costs, lost sales, delays in commercial release, third-party claims, contractual disputes, negative publicity, delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products or services, license terminations or renegotiations and/or unexpected expenses and diversion of resources to remedy or mitigate such errors, defects or malfunctions. The realization of any of these events could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWhile we have provisions in our client contracts that are designed to limit our liability from claims brought by our clients or third parties relating to our products or services, these provisions could be invalidated or fail to adequately limit our liability. In addition, clients also increasingly require us to provide contractual assurances regarding our risk management and security practices or policies, and many of our clients in the financial services sector are subject to regulations and requirements to adopt risk management processes to oversee their third-party relationships. Contractual disputes could result in the provision of credits, adverse monetary judgments and other penalties and damages. Any such claims brought against us, even if the outcome were to be ultimately favorable to us, would require attention of our management, personnel, financial and other resources and could have a negative impact on our reputation or pose a significant disruption to our normal business operations. In addition, the duration or outcome of such claims and lawsuits is difficult to predict, which could further exacerbate the adverse effect they may have on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic, or other widespread health crises, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant economic disruption, including volatility in the global equity markets. Our operations have been affected by a range of external factors related to the COVID-19 pandemic that are not within our control, including the imposition in many jurisdictions of a wide range of restrictions on the physical movement of our employees and vendors to limit the spread of COVID-19. Even though some initial measures have been relaxed, certain restrictions have been reinstated as new variants of COVID-19 have emerged, and other measures may be put back into place or increased if the spread of the COVID-19 pandemic continues or increases in the future. While we were not materially impacted in 2021, due to ongoing uncertainty related to the duration, magnitude and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic, its potential effects on our business are uncertain and difficult to predict, but may include:\n17\nThese effects, alone or taken together, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. If the COVID-19 pandemic is sustained or prolonged, these effects could be exacerbated. Additionally, many of the other risk factors described in this Item may be exacerbated or the likelihood of such risks materializing may be increased by global widespread health crises such as the COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from the pandemic and responses to the pandemic.\nWe cannot assure you that we will be successful in our attempts to mitigate any negative effects of this global pandemic on our business, including implementing our business continuity plans and processes, transitioning to remote and flexible-work models globally, proactively reducing costs intended to allow us to protect against further downside revenue risk, and investing in additional initiatives to support our long-term growth, while also focusing on maintaining liquidity and capital structure flexibility.\nWe closely monitor the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic and continually assess its potential effects on our business and take appropriate actions in accordance with the recommendations and requirements of relevant authorities. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic may impact our operational and financial performance remains uncertain and will depend on many factors outside of our control, including the timing, extent, trajectory and duration of the pandemic; the emergence, spread and severity of new variants of COVID-19; the development, availability, distribution and effectiveness of vaccines and treatments; the imposition of protective public safety measures, including vaccine and testing mandates; and the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, including financial markets.\nThis situation is changing rapidly, and additional effects may arise that we are not presently aware of or that we currently do not consider significant risks to our operations. If we are not able to respond to and manage the impact of such events effectively, our business, financial condition or results of operations may be negatively impacted.\nMSCI is exposed to potential reputational and credibility concerns.\nTo the extent that any of MSCI’s operating segments or product lines or MSCI as a whole suffers a reputational or other loss in credibility, it could have a material adverse impact on MSCI’s business. Real or perceived factors that may have already affected credibility, or which could potentially have an impact in this regard, include: the appearance of a conflict of interest; the editorial independence of our index composition and ESG rating and assessment processes and decisions; the influence of third parties, including governments and large investors or asset owners, on our editorial decisions; the performance of companies relative to their ESG ratings, index inclusion, risk characteristics or other MSCI content or analytics; the timing and nature of changes to our indexes or ESG ratings and assessments; disagreement with our methodologies or models, including for calculating indexes, value-at-risk and other risk measures, ESG ratings and assessments, data, information and analysis; the accuracy and completeness of our data; views expressed by the media, politicians, other government officials or representatives, regulators or other third parties regarding our company or our industry or our role in the investment process; our own sustainability and corporate responsibility policies or practices, including as a result of (i) failure to meet publicly disclosed ESG and climate-related targets or goals, or (ii) misalignment with evolving market standards or the methodologies and standards used in our products and ESG ratings; and the impact of political tensions relating to countries, industries, companies or issues relevant to our products and services, such as the inclusion of certain Chinese companies in our indexes or the focus on sustainable investing and climate considerations in our offerings. In some cases, our ESG and Climate offerings, such as our company ESG ratings and our Net-Zero Tracker, may insert MSCI into a public spotlight or debate regarding the environment, social concerns or corporate responsibility. In addition, our position as a leading source of ESG research, ratings, data and\n18\nassessments may at times become contentious or controversial and lead to disputes with companies or investors or other interested stakeholders and create negative media or regulatory attention\n. Errors and other actions by\nMSCI competitor\ns could also damage the reputation of the industries that we operate in and, therefore\n, harm the reputation of the Company or\ncertain of our products\n.\nIn addition, we believe that MSCI’s corporate culture and reputation contribute to our ability to attract and retain talent, and reputational damage could negatively affect both our hiring and employee retention.\nDamage to\nour\nreputation\n, brand\nor\ncredibility could have a material adverse impact on MSCI’s business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations\n.\nClient Risks\nOur clients that pay us a fee based on the assets under management or total expense ratio of an indexed investment product may seek to negotiate a lower asset-based fee percentage or lower the total expense ratio of such products or may cease using our indexes, which could limit the growth of or decrease our revenues from asset-based fees.\nA portion of our revenues are from asset-based fees and these revenue streams are concentrated in some of our largest clients, including BlackRock, and in our largest market, the U.S. Our clients, including our largest clients, may seek for a variety of reasons to negotiate to pay us lower asset-based fee percentages, which are sometimes calculated as a percentage of the relevant product’s total expense ratio (“TER”). Additionally, competition is intense among our clients that offer or manage indexed investment products, including ETFs, and low fees are one of the competitive differentiators. Where an investment product’s TER determines our fees, a reduction in the TER may negatively impact our revenues. Additionally, our clients, including our largest clients, may seek to renegotiate existing asset-based fee models with the objective of achieving lower fees, either on a rate basis or in aggregate, which may have a negative impact on our operating revenues.\nMoreover, clients that have licensed our indexes to serve as the basis of indexed investment products are generally not required to continue to use our indexes and could elect at any time to cease offering the investment product or switch to using a non-MSCI index. Clients that license our indexes to serve as the basis for listed futures and options contracts might also discontinue such contracts. Additionally, we have a differentiated licensing strategy for our indexes and from time to time experience faster growth from lower fee products, resulting in a lower average asset-based fee percentage from indexed investment products. While we aim to maximize the price and volume trade-off over the long-term, there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so. Results for any given quarter could be materially adversely affected by stronger growth in assets in indexed investment products with lower-than-average fees not sufficiently offset by growth in assets in indexed investment products with higher-than-average fees. Our asset-based fees could dramatically decrease, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. Finally, to the extent that multiple investment products are based on the same index, (i) assets under management in one product could shift to products that pay MSCI lower fee levels, (ii) the products could compete for the same assets such that none of the products becomes large enough to be successful or sustained, or (iii) the failure or discontinuance of one product (\ne.g.\n, derivatives used for hedging) could have a detrimental effect on the use of the other products (\ne.g.\n, ETFs).\nCancellations or reductions by any of our largest clients could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nA material portion of our revenues is concentrated in some of our largest customers. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, our largest client organization by revenue, BlackRock, accounted for 12.7% of our total revenues. For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020, BlackRock accounted for 11.0% of our total revenues. Our revenue growth depends on our ability to obtain new clients, sell additional services to existing clients and achieve and sustain a high level of renewal rates with respect to our existing licenses. Failure to achieve one or more of these objectives could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. If one or more of our largest clients cancels or reduces its licenses and we are unsuccessful in replacing those licenses, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur clients may become more self-sufficient, which may reduce demand for our products or services and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur clients may internally develop certain functionality contained in the products or services they currently license from us. For example, a number of our clients have obtained regulatory clearance to create indexes for use as the basis of ETFs that they manage and others have invested in direct indexing strategies, allowing investors to purchase individual stocks making up an index rather than investing in a fund or ETF. Similarly, some of our clients who currently license our risk or ESG and climate data to analyze their portfolio risk may develop their own tools to collect data and assess risk or embed ESG and climate considerations into their investment processes, making our products or services unnecessary for them. A growing number of asset managers and investment banks, in partnership with index providers that offer calculation agent services, or acting together with an industry group or\n19\nassociation, have created or may create their own range of proprietary indexes, which they use to manage funds or as the basis of ETFs, structured products or over-the-counter derivatives. To the extent that our clients become more self-sufficient, demand for our products or services may be reduced, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations.\nTechnology Risks\nAny failures, disruptions, instability or vulnerabilities in our information technology architecture, platforms, vendors and service providers, production and delivery systems, software, code, internal network, the Internet or other systems or applications may disrupt our operations, cause our products to be unavailable or fail and impose delays or additional costs in deploying our products, or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or keep them confidential and result in reputational and other harm and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe depend heavily on the capacity, reliability and security of our information technology systems and platforms and their components, including our data centers, cloud providers and other vendors and service providers, production and delivery systems as well the Internet, to create and deliver our products and service our clients. Our employees also depend on these systems, platforms and providers for internal use. Heavy use of our electronic delivery systems and other factors such as loss of service from third parties, operational failures, human error, terrorist or other attacks affecting systems or sites where we are located, climate or weather related events (\ne.g.\n, hurricanes, floods or other natural disasters), another outbreak of pandemic or contagious disease, power loss, telecommunications failures, technical breakdowns, Internet failures or malicious software could impair our systems’ operations or interrupt their availability for extended periods of time or impact the availability of personnel. Our ability to effectively use the Internet, including our remote work force’s ability to access the Internet, may also be impaired due to infrastructure failures, service outages at third-party Internet providers or increased government regulation.\nDisruptions, failures or slowdowns that could occur with respect to our operations, including to our information technology systems and platforms, our electronic delivery systems or the Internet, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation and negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients, including delivering managed services or delivering real-time index data. To the extent we grow through acquisitions, newly acquired businesses may not have invested in technological infrastructure and disaster recovery to the same extent as we have. As their systems are integrated into ours, a vulnerability could be introduced, which could impact our platforms across the Company.\nThere is no assurance that we will be able to successfully defend against such disruptions or that our disaster recovery or business continuity plans, or those of our third-party service providers (including cloud providers), will be effective in mitigating the risks and associated costs, which could be exacerbated by our shift to an increasingly remote working environment, and which could have a material impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nAny failure to ensure and protect the confidentiality of data could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nMany of our products, as well as our internal systems and processes, involve the collection, retrieval, processing, storage and transmission of proprietary, third party and client confidential information. We also handle personal information of our employees in connection with their employment. We rely on a complex system of internal processes and IT controls along with policies, procedures and training to protect this information, including sensitive client data such as material non-public information and client portfolio data that may be provided to us or hosted on our systems, against unauthorized access or disclosure. In addition, we believe that when we change the composition of our indexes, in some cases the changes can have an indirect effect on the prices of constituent securities and on certain indexed investment products as a result of trading activity related to tracking our indexes. As the usage and types of uses of our ESG ratings increase, the ratings and changes to the ratings in some cases could also potentially have an impact on the companies that we rate, the price of their securities and the price of other securities that reference their securities.\nIf our internal processes, confidentiality policies, conflict of interest policies or information barrier procedures fail or are insufficient, including as a result of human error or manual processes, system error or other failure, or if an employee purposely circumvents or violates our internal controls, policies or procedures, then unauthorized access to, or disclosure or misappropriation of, data, including material non-public or other confidential information (\ne.g.\n, certain index composition data or ESG rating data), our brand and reputation may suffer and we may become subject to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other penalties, leading to a loss of client confidence, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n20\nSuccessful cyber-attacks and the failure of cyber-security plans, systems and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe Company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of data and information, and on those of our third-party vendors. We and our vendors are subject to cyber risks, including cyber-attacks, such as phishing scams, hacking, tampering, intrusions, viruses, ransomware, malware and denial-of-service attacks. In some cases, these risks are heightened when employees are working remotely. Our and our vendors’ use of mobile and cloud technologies may also increase our risk for such threats. The Company may be exposed to more targeted and more sophisticated cyber-attacks aimed at accessing certain information on our systems because of our role or prominence in the global marketplace, including client portfolio data, the composition of our indexes and MSCI ESG Research ratings of corporate issuers. Any such threats may cause material interruptions or malfunctions in our or our vendors’ products or services, networks, systems, websites, applications, data or data processing, or may otherwise compromise the availability, confidentiality or integrity of data or information in our possession. While the Company has not experienced cyber incidents that are individually, or in the aggregate, material, the Company has experienced cyber-attacks of varying degrees in the past, including denial-of-service attacks, and there can be no assurance that there will not be a material adverse effect in the future.\nOur security measures or those of our third-party providers, including any cloud-based technologies, may prove insufficient depending upon the attack or threat posed. Cyber-attacks, security breaches or third-party reports of perceived security vulnerability to the Company’s systems, even if no breach has occurred, could damage our brand and reputation, result in litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions or other penalties, lead to loss of client confidence, which would harm our ability to retain clients and gain new ones, and lead to financial losses. Any of the foregoing could lead to unexpected or higher than estimated costs. We may also incur additional costs as a result of increasing and refining our internal processes and IT controls and policies and procedures related to security, processing integrity and confidentiality or privacy.\nMigration of our applications, systems, processes and infrastructure to new technologies, cloud providers, data centers, processes, platforms or applications could result in unanticipated failures, interruptions or delays in the performance and delivery of our products, services and client support.  Such incidents could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn the past, we have experienced unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain products after we migrated applications and infrastructure to new data centers. While we have taken steps to mitigate such interruptions and delays, we cannot provide assurance that they will not occur again in the future as part of migration efforts to new technologies, applications or processes (\ne.g.\n, cloud migration), even after extensive testing of new systems, processes, applications and hardware, or if we experience significant growth of our customer base or increases in the number of products or services or in the speed at which we are required to provide products and services. Such disruptions may result in cancellations and reduced demand for our products and services, resulting in decreased revenues, or in cost increases relating to our use of power and data storage. After adopting new technologies, applications and processes, such as cloud computing, virtualization and agile software development, we may experience unanticipated interruption and delay in the performance and delivery of certain of our products, services and client support. We may also incur increased operating expenses to recover data, repair, replace or remediate systems, equipment or facilities, and to protect ourselves from such disruptions. Accordingly, any significant failures, disruptions or instability affecting our information technology platform, cloud providers, data centers, production and delivery systems, applications, processes or the Internet could negatively affect our ability to distribute our products effectively and to service our clients, damage our brand and reputation and result in litigation, which may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur use of open source code could introduce security vulnerabilities, impose unanticipated delays or costs in deploying our products or services, or impose conditions or restrictions on our ability to commercialize our products or services or keep them confidential.\nWe rely on open source code to develop software and to incorporate it in our products and internal systems. The use of open source code may entail greater risks than the use of third-party commercial software, as open source licensors generally do not provide warranties or other contractual protections regarding infringement claims, the quality of the code or the security of the code. Some open source licenses provide that if we combine our proprietary code with open source code and distribute it in a certain manner, we could be required to release the source code of our proprietary applications to the public. This would allow our competitors to create similar products with less development effort and time and ultimately put us at a competitive disadvantage. Additionally, the terms of many open source code licenses are ambiguous and have not been interpreted by U.S. courts. Therefore, we could be required to seek licenses from third parties on terms that are not commercially feasible, to make generally available portions of our proprietary code, to re-engineer our products or systems, to discontinue the licensing of our products if re-engineering could not be accomplished on a timely or cost-effective basis, or to take other remedial action that\n21\ncould divert resources away from our development efforts. Any of these requirements could materially adversely affect our business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations\n.\nStrategy and Growth Risks\nOur business may be affected by changes in the global capital markets, including adverse equity market conditions, volatility in the financial markets and evolving investment trends. Such changes could decrease the use of our products and services which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur business is impacted by economic conditions and volatility in the global capital markets. Our clients use our products for a variety of purposes, including benchmarking, performance attribution, portfolio construction and risk management, and to support investment strategies including ESG, climate, factor, thematic, private asset and MAC investing. Volatile capital markets may impact whether, how, where and when investors choose to invest, for example between developed or emerging markets, U.S. or non-U.S. markets, as well as whether to adopt different investment strategies.\nA portion of our revenues comes from clients who use our indexes as the basis for indexed investment products. These fees are primarily based on a client’s assets under management or trading volumes. The value of an investment product’s assets may increase or decrease in response to changes in market performance and cash inflows and outflows, which could impact our revenues.\nAdditionally, an increasing portion of our revenues comes from products and services that relate to certain investment trends, such as ESG and climate, factor, thematic, private asset and MAC investing. A decline in the equity markets or movement away from such investment trends could decrease demand for our related products and services, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition and financial and budgetary pressures affecting clients in our industry may cause price reductions or loss of market share, which may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nCompetition exists across all markets for our products and services. Our competitors range in size from large companies with substantial resources to small, single-product businesses that are highly specialized. Our larger competitors may have access to more resources and may be able to achieve greater economies of scale, and our specialized competitors may be more effective in devoting technical, marketing and financial resources to compete with us with respect to a particular product or service. Some competitors may offer price incentives or different pricing structures that are more attractive to clients. The competitive landscape may also experience consolidation in the form of mergers and acquisitions, joint ventures or strategic partnerships, which result in a narrower pool of competitors that are better capitalized or that are able to gain a competitive advantage through synergies.\nBarriers to entry may be low or declining in many of the markets for our products and services, including for single-purpose product companies, which could lead to the emergence of new competitors. For example, more broker-dealers, data suppliers, credit rating agencies or other market participants or vendors could begin developing their own content such as proprietary risk analytics, ESG and climate data or indexes. Recent developments, including increases in the availability of free or relatively inexpensive information through Internet sources or other low-cost delivery systems, advances in cloud computing, increased use of open source code, the ability of machine learning and other artificial intelligence systems to process and organize large data sets, as well as client development of proprietary applications in specific areas, have further reduced barriers to entry in some cases.\nWe may experience pressures to reduce our fees on account of financial and budgetary pressures affecting our clients, including those resulting from weak or volatile economic or market conditions, including uncertainty regarding the duration and long-term economic and societal consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may lead certain clients to reduce their overall spending on our products or services, including by seeking similar products or services at a lower cost than what we are able to provide, by consolidating their spending with fewer providers, by consolidating with other clients or by self-sourcing certain of their information and analytical needs. Accordingly, competitive and market pressures may result in fewer clients or reduced sales, including as a result of client closures and consolidations, price reductions, prolonged selling and renewal cycles and increased operating costs, such as for marketing and product development, which could, individually or in the aggregate, result in a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n22\nTo remain competitive, we must successfully develop new and enhanced products and services and effectively manage product transitions and integrations.\nTo remain competitive, we must continually introduce new products and services, enhance existing products and services, including through integration of products and services within MSCI and with third-party platforms, and effectively generate customer demand for new and enhanced products and services. We may not be successful in developing, introducing, implementing, marketing, pricing, launching or licensing new products or enhancements on a timely or cost-effective basis or without impacting the stability and efficiency of existing products and systems. Any new products and enhancements may not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or industry standards or achieve market acceptance.\nThe process of developing and enhancing our products and services is complex and may become increasingly complex and expensive in the future due to the introduction of new platforms, operating systems, technologies and customer expectations. In addition, our reputation could be harmed if we are perceived as not innovating rapidly enough to meet the changing needs of investors or their advisors. We must make long-term investments and commit significant resources before knowing whether these investments will eventually result in new or enhanced products and services that satisfy our clients’ needs and generate adequate revenues. From time to time, we also incur costs to integrate existing products and services and transition clients to enhanced products and services, which also present execution risks and challenges and could lead to price reductions or other concessions. If we are unable to effectively manage the development of new or enhanced products and services, we may not be able to remain competitive and our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur global operations and any future expansions may continue to place significant strain on our management and other resources, as well as subject us to additional, and in some cases unanticipated, risks and costs in connection with political, economic, legal, operational and other issues resulting from our increased global footprint, which could materially adversely impact our businesses.\nOur global operations and any future expansion are expected to continue to place significant demands on our personnel, management and other resources. Whether we expand organically or by way of acquisition, there can be no assurance that we will effectively attract, engage and retain additional qualified personnel, including additional managers or key employees, develop effective leadership in all our locations; expand our physical facilities and information technology, legal and compliance infrastructure; integrate acquired businesses; or otherwise adequately manage expansion. Additionally, new hires require significant training and may, in some cases, take a significant amount of time before becoming fully productive.\nOur global operations also expose us to political, economic, legal, operational, franchise and other risks that are inherent in operating in many countries, including risks of possible capital controls, exchange controls, customs duties, sanctions compliance, tax penalties, levies or assessments, legal uncertainty, broad regulatory discretion and other restrictive governmental actions, as well as the outbreak of hostilities or political and governmental instability in certain of the countries or regions in which we conduct operations. The majority of our employees are located in offices outside of the U.S. and a number of those employees are located in emerging market locations. The cost of establishing and maintaining these offices, including costs related to information technology infrastructure, as well as the costs of attracting, training and retaining employees in these locations may be higher, or may increase at a faster rate, than we anticipate. Additionally, public health epidemics impacting the global economy and our employees, such as the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic, may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe laws and regulations in many countries applicable to our business are uncertain and evolving, and it may be difficult or costly for us to determine and remain compliant with the exact requirements of local laws in every market. Our inability to maintain consistent internal policies and procedures across our offices and remain in compliance with local laws in a particular market could have a significant and negative effect not only on our businesses in that market but also on our reputation generally.\nDemand for our products and services is still nascent in many parts of the world, particularly in emerging market locations where risk management and ESG and climate integration practices are often not fully developed.  In addition, the data required to model local securities in some emerging markets might be difficult to source and local investment product nuances may be difficult or costly to model. If we do not appropriately tailor our products and services to fit the needs of the local market, we may be unable to effectively grow sales of our products and\n23\nservices\nin some locations\noutside of the U.S. There can be no assurances that demand for our products and services will develop in these countries.\nAny failure to effectively manage expansion or to effectively manage the business globally could damage our brand and reputation, result in increased costs and litigation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nLegal and Regulatory Risks\nFailure to comply with regulations, or the introduction of new regulations or changes to existing regulations could materially adversely affect our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nFailure to comply with any applicable laws, rules, orders, regulations or other requirements could subject us to litigation, regulatory actions, sanctions, fines or other penalties, as well as damage our brand and reputation. The financial services industry, within which we and many of our clients operate, is subject to extensive laws, rules and regulations at the federal and state levels, as well as by foreign governments, with some jurisdictions regulating indexes directly. These laws, rules and regulations are complex, evolve frequently and sometimes quickly and unexpectedly, and are subject to administrative interpretation and judicial construction in ways that are difficult to predict, and could materially adversely affect our business and our clients’ businesses. Uncertainty caused by political change globally heightens regulatory uncertainty. Additionally, we may be required to comply with multiple and potentially conflicting laws, rules or regulations in various jurisdictions, which could, individually or in the aggregate, result in materially higher compliance costs to us. It is possible that laws, rules or regulations could cause us to restrict or change the way we license and price our products and services or could impose additional costs on us. Changes to the laws, rules and regulations applicable to our clients could limit our clients’ ability to use our products and services or could otherwise impact our clients’ demand for our products and services. As such, to the extent that our clients become subject to certain laws, rules or regulations, we may incur higher costs in connection with modifying our products or services. To the extent that we rely on our clients and vendors to provide data for our products and services and certain laws, rules or regulations impact our clients’ and vendors’ ability or willingness to provide that data to us or regulate the fees for which such data can be provided, our ability to continue to produce our products and services or the related costs could be negatively impacted. The regulations and regulatory developments that most significantly impact us are described below:\nThe EU-UK Trade and Cooperation Agreement and the MOU provide some clarity regarding the future relationship between the UK and the EU including some detailed matters of trade and cooperation, but there remain uncertainties related to Brexit and the new relationship between the UK and EU that will continue to be developed and defined, as well as uncertainties related to the wider trading, legal, regulatory, tax and labor environments, and the resulting impact on our business and that of our clients. Because we have significant operations in the EU and certain members of our senior management team are based in the UK, any of these uncertainties could increase our costs of doing business, or in some cases, affect our ability to do business, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\n24\nFor example, the benchmark industry is subject to regulations in the\nEU\n, such as\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1011 (as amended),\nwhich is also applicable in the UK\nas it forms part of UK domestic law by virtue of the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended)\n, as well as increased scrutiny and potential new or increased regulation in various other jurisdictions. Additionally, the European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) issues guidance from time to time regarding interpretations of the\nEU\nbenchmark regulation\n(such as\nRegulation (EU) 2016/1011\n(as amended)\nand Regulation (EU) No 600/2014\n)\n. The ESMA Guidelines on ETFs and other UCITS Issues limit the types of indexes that can be used as the basis of Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (“UCITS”) funds and require, among other things, index constituents, together with their respective weightings, to be made easily accessible free of charge, such as via the internet, to investors and prospective investors on a delayed and periodic basis. The International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”) recommends that benchmark administrators, on a voluntary basis, publicly disclose whether they comply with the principles for financial benchmarks published by IOSCO.\nOther jurisdictions have also indicated they may consider potential benchmark regulation or conduct reviews of the benchmark industry.\nFor instance, the UK FCA has announced that it will conduct a market study into how competition is working\nin the markets for benchmarks and indices.\nThe heightened attention and scrutiny on benchmarks and index providers by regulators, policymakers and the media in the EU, the U.S. and other jurisdictions around the world could result in negative publicity or comments about the role or influence of our company or the index industry generally, which could harm our reputation and credibility.\nFurther, laws, rules, regulations and orders affecting users of our indexes can have an indirect impact on our indexes, including their construction and composition, such as sanctions that prohibit users of our indexes from investing or transacting in securities included in our indexes.\nIn some instances, in connection with the provision of data and services, we have incurred additional costs to implement processes and systems at the request of our clients to ensure that the products and services that they in turn provide to their clients using our data are compliant with the financial regulations to which our clients may be subject. For example, a U.S. Executive Order prohibiting many of our clients from transacting in the securities of certain Chinese companies resulted in our decision to remove these companies from relevant indexes in order to support our clients’ needs that our indexes meet their objective to be replicable in investment portfolios. To the\n25\nextent that our clients are subject to increased regulation, we may be indirectly impacted and could incur increased costs that could have a negative impact on the profitability of certain products.\nAdditionally, there has been increased attention on and scrutiny of index and ESG rating providers by politicians, regulators, policymakers and the media, which could create negative publicity that could harm our reputation or credibility as well as result in new or additional regulation that could increase our costs and have a negative impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations. For example, IOSCO has asked regulators to consider focusing more attention on the use of ESG ratings and data products and ESG ratings and data products providers that may be subject to their jurisdiction, and ESMA has called for entities issuing ESG ratings and assessments to be registered and supervised. These or similar regulatory regimes could impose significant compliance burdens and costs on our ESG and Climate products and services. Furthermore, regulation in multiple jurisdictions may be inconsistent, which could create implementation challenges and result in inadvertent noncompliance.\nLegal protections for our intellectual property rights and other rights may not be sufficient or available to protect our competitive advantages. Third parties may infringe on our intellectual property rights or we may infringe upon their intellectual property rights, which, in each case, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe consider many aspects of our products and services to be proprietary. We rely primarily on a combination of trade secrets, patents, copyrights and trademark rights, laws regarding unfair competition and the misappropriation of intellectual property, as well as technical measures and contractual protections, such as non-disclosure obligations, to protect our products and services. Despite our best efforts, we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken to protect our intellectual property rights, and the rights of those from whom we license intellectual property, are adequate to prevent unauthorized use, misappropriation, distribution or theft of our intellectual property.\nIntellectual property laws in various jurisdictions in which we operate are subject to change or varying interpretations at any time and could further restrict our ability to protect our intellectual property rights. The enforceability of intellectual property rights and obligations under our agreements, as well as the availability of remedies in the event of a breach, may vary due to the different jurisdictions in which our clients and employees are located. Failure to protect our intellectual property adequately could harm us, our brand or reputation and affect our ability to compete effectively.\nThere is no guarantee that any intellectual property rights that we may obtain will protect our competitive advantages, nor is there any assurance that our competitors will not infringe upon our rights. Furthermore, our competitors may independently develop and protect products and services that are the same or similar to ours. We may be unable to detect the unauthorized use or disclosure of our intellectual property or confidential information, or to take the necessary steps to enforce our rights. In addition, our products and services, or third-party products that we provide to our clients, could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others.\nPursuing intellectual property claims to preserve our intellectual property rights or responding to intellectual property claims, regardless of merit, can consume valuable time, and result in costly litigation or delays, and there is no guarantee that we will be successful. From time to time, we receive claims or notices from third parties alleging infringement or potential infringement of their intellectual property rights; and the number of these claims may grow. These intellectual property claims would likely be costly to defend and could require us to pay damages, limit our future use of certain technologies, harm our brand and reputation, significantly increase our costs and prevent us from offering some services or products. We may need to settle such claims on unfavorable terms, pay damages, stop providing or using the affected products or services or enter into royalty or licensing agreements, which may include terms that are not commercially acceptable to us. From time to time, we receive notices calling upon us to defend partners, clients, suppliers or distributors against third-party claims under indemnification clauses in our contracts. If any of these risks materialize, they could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nThere have been a number of lawsuits in multiple jurisdictions, including in the U.S. and Germany, regarding whether issuers of indexed investment products are required to obtain a license from the index owner or whether issuers may issue investment products based on publicly available index-level data without obtaining permission from (or making payment to) the index owner. The outcome of these cases depends on a number of factors, including the governing law, the amount of information about the index available without a license and the other\n26\nparticular facts and circumstances of the cases. In some instances, the results have been unfavorable to the index owner. If courts or regulators or other governmental bodies in relevant jurisdictions determine that a license is not required to issue investment products linked to indexes, this could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations. It might also lead to changes in current industry practices such that we would no longer make our index level data publicly available, such as via our website or news media, on a timely basis.\nSome of our products and services help our clients to meet their regulatory requirements. Changes to regulatory requirements may obviate the need for these products or services or may cause us to invest in enhancing the products or services to help our clients meet the new regulatory requirements.\nFinancial Risks\nOur revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk.\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation risk. Exchange rate movements can impact the U.S. dollar reported value of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded. Additionally, the value of assets in indexed investment products can fluctuate significantly over short periods of time and such volatility may be further impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nWe manage certain portions of our foreign currency exchange rate risk, in part, through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. Any derivative financial instruments that we are currently party to or may enter into in the future may not be successful, resulting in an adverse impact on our results of operations.\nIn addition, Brexit has caused, and may continue to cause, significant volatility in currency exchange rates, especially between the U.S. dollar and the British pound sterling. To the extent that our international activities recorded in local currencies increase or decrease in the future, our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may correspondingly increase or decrease and could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nOur indebtedness could materially adversely affect our cash flows and financial flexibility.\nFor an overview of our current outstanding indebtedness and history of our debt offerings, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations” below. Although we believe that our cash flows will be sufficient to service our outstanding indebtedness, we cannot provide assurance that we will generate and maintain cash flows sufficient to permit us to pay the principal, premium, if any, and interest on our indebtedness. Our ability to make payments on indebtedness and to fund planned capital expenditures depends on our ability to generate and access cash in the future, which, in turn, is subject to general economic, financial, competitive, regulatory and other factors, many of which are beyond our control. If we are unable to pay our obligations as they mature, we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity. If we are unable to secure additional financing on terms favorable or acceptable to us or at all, we could also be forced to sell assets to make up for any shortfall in our payment obligations. The restrictive covenants in our debt agreements, however, limit our and our subsidiaries’ ability to sell assets and also restrict the use of proceeds from such a sale. If we cannot refinance or otherwise pay our obligations as they mature and fund our liquidity needs, our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, liquidity, ability to obtain financing and ability to compete in our industry could be materially adversely affected.\nWe may need or want to refinance our existing debt or incur additional debt from time to time to finance working capital, capital expenditures, investments or acquisitions, or for other purposes. If we do so, we may be subject to less favorable terms. The risks related to our level of indebtedness could also intensify, including by making it difficult for us to optimally capitalize and manage the cash flow for our business or placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less indebtedness.\nFurthermore, the terms of our debt agreements include restrictive covenants that limit, among other things, our and our existing and future subsidiaries’ financial flexibility. If we are unable to comply with the restrictions and covenants in our debt agreements, there could be a default that, in some cases, if continuing, could result in the accelerated payment of our debt obligations or the termination of borrowing commitments on the part of the lenders under the Credit Agreement, dated as of November 20, 2014, by and among the Company, the guarantors party\n27\nthereto, JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent and the lenders from\ntime to time party thereto, as amended, supplemented, modified or amended and restated from time to time (as amended, the “\nRevolving Credit\nFacility\n”).\nIn 2017, the UK Financial Conduct Authority (the “FCA”), which regulates London Interbank Offered Rate (“LIBOR”), announced that the FCA will no longer persuade or compel banks to submit rates for the calculation of the LIBOR benchmark after 2021. The administrator for LIBOR announced on March 5, 2021 that it will permanently cease to publish most LIBOR settings beginning on January 1, 2022 and cease to publish the overnight, one-month, three-month, six-month and 12-month USD LIBOR settings on July 1, 2023. Accordingly, the FCA has stated that is does not intend to persuade or compel banks to submit to LIBOR after such respective dates. Until such time, however, FCA panel banks have agreed to continue to support LIBOR. The U.S. Federal Reserve, in conjunction with the Alternative Reference Rates Committee, a steering committee comprised of large U.S. financial institutions, is recommending replacing USD LIBOR with the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (“SOFR”), a new index calculated by short-term repurchase agreements, backed by Treasury securities. It is unknown whether SOFR will attain market acceptance as replacement for LIBOR and, because SOFR differs fundamentally from LIBOR, there is no assurance that SOFR will perform in the same way as LIBOR would have performed at any time, and there is no guarantee that it is a comparable substitute for LIBOR. At this time, it is not possible to predict the effect that these developments may have on any floating rate debt instruments, including borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility. As of December 31, 2021, there were no amounts outstanding under our Revolving Credit Facility. Pursuant to the Credit Agreement Amendment that became effective on March 29, 2021, we updated the LIBOR succession provisions in our Revolving Credit Facility to contemplate a mechanism for replacing LIBOR with a new benchmark rate without an amendment to the terms of the Credit Agreement governing the Revolving Credit Facility. Since the conditions for the implementation of this mechanism have not yet been triggered, we cannot determine with certainty what such replacement rate would be. As a result, we cannot reasonably predict the potential effect of a discontinuation or replacement of LIBOR, other reforms or the establishment of alternative reference rates on our business, financial condition or results of operations. In addition, if we were to incur any variable rate indebtedness under our Revolving Credit Facility, we would be subject to interest rate risk generally, which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly.\nA change in our credit ratings could materially adversely affect our financial condition.\nOur credit ratings are not recommendations to buy, sell or hold any of our common stock or outstanding debt. Our outstanding debt under the Senior Notes currently has non-investment grade ratings. Any rating assigned to such debt is subject to ongoing evaluation by the credit rating agencies and could be lowered or withdrawn entirely at any time by any of the agencies if, in the agency’s judgment, future circumstances relating to the basis of the rating so warrant. Such future circumstances include, but are not limited to, adverse changes to our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows, or revisions to our corporate strategy pertaining to capitalization or leverage. Any such downgrade or withdrawal could adversely affect the amount of capital we can access, as well as the terms of any financing we obtain.\nIn addition, our debt covenants contain certain obligations that are triggered by a change in our credit rating, including obligations to make repurchase offers to the noteholders of our Senior Notes if we experience one of the specified kinds of changes in control and related lowering of our credit ratings, as detailed in the indentures governing our Senior Notes.\nAny adverse change in our credit rating could have a negative effect on our liquidity and future growth through transactions in which we rely on the ability to receive debt capital at an advantageous cost and on favorable terms. Accordingly, actual or anticipated changes or downgrades to or withdrawal of our credit ratings, including any announcement that our ratings are under review or have been assigned a negative outlook, could result in damage to our brand and reputation and have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows and on the market value of our common stock and outstanding debt.\nWe may have exposure to tax liabilities in various jurisdictions. Future changes in tax law could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate.\nWe are subject to income taxes, as well as non-income or indirect taxes, in the U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our global provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities. In the ordinary course of a global business, there are many intercompany transactions and calculations\n28\nwhere the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. Changes in domestic and international tax laws could negatively impact our overall effective tax rate.\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities. We may be subject to additional tax liabilities as the jurisdictions in which we do business globally are increasingly focused on digital taxes and the treatment of remote workforces. Although we believe that our tax provisions are reasonable, there can be no assurance that the final determination of tax audits or tax disputes will not be different from what is reflected in our historical income tax provisions and accruals. To the extent we are required to pay amounts in excess of our reserves, such differences could have a material adverse effect on our Consolidated Statement of Income for a particular future period. In addition, an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs.\nGeneral Risks\nOur business performance might not be sufficient for us to meet the full-year financial guidance or long-term targets that we provide publicly.\nWe provide certain full-year financial guidance and long-term targets to the public based upon our assumptions regarding our expected financial performance that may not always prove to be accurate and may vary from actual results. If we fail to meet the full-year financial guidance or achieve the long-term targets that we provide, or if we find it necessary to revise such guidance or targets, the market value of our common stock or other securities could be adversely affected.\nOur growth and profitability may not continue at the same rate as we have experienced in the past for several reasons, including if our operating costs are higher than expected, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nWe have experienced significant revenue and earnings growth since we began operations. There can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain the levels of growth and profitability that we have experienced in the past. If we experience higher than expected operating costs, including increased compensation costs, regulatory compliance costs, occupancy costs, selling and marketing costs, investments in geographic expansion, market data costs, software license costs, communication costs, travel costs, application development costs, professional fees, costs related to information technology infrastructure, cloud usage and other IT costs, and we cannot adjust to these costs, our operating results may fluctuate significantly or our anticipated profitability may be reduced and our anticipated results of operations and financial position may be materially adversely affected. Additionally, there can be no assurance that we will be as successful in our product development, selling and marketing efforts, or capital return or allocation strategies as we have been in the past, or that such efforts will result in growth or profit margins comparable to those we have experienced in the past.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities as a result of failure to comply with laws and regulations relating to our global operations, including anti-corruption laws, and any determination that we violated these laws could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to complex laws and regulations that are applicable to our global operations, such as laws and regulations governing economic and trade sanctions, tariffs, embargoes, anti-boycott restrictions and anti-corruption and other similar laws and regulations. Any determination that we have violated these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations.\nIn particular, we are subject to various anti-corruption laws that prohibit improper payments or benefits or offers of payments or benefits to foreign governments and their officials and, in some cases, to employees of a business for the purpose of directing, obtaining or retaining business. We conduct business in countries and regions that are less developed than the U.S. and in some cases are generally recognized as potentially more corrupt business environments. Our activities in these countries create the risk of unauthorized payments or offers of payments by one of our employees or agents that could be in violation of various anti-corruption laws including the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, as amended (the “FCPA”) and the UK Bribery Act 2010.\nWe have implemented safeguards and policies to discourage these types of practices by our employees and agents. However, our existing safeguards and any future improvements may prove to be less than fully effective, and\n29\nour employees or agents may engage in conduct for which we might be held responsible. If employees violate our policies or we fail to maintain adequate record-keeping and internal accounting practices to accurately record our transactions we may be subject to regulatory fines, sanctions, damages or other penalties or costs. Violations of any of these laws, including the FCPA or other anti-corruption laws, may result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and penalties, damage our brand and reputation and subject us to other liabilities which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial\ncondition\nor results of operations.\nIf we are unable to successfully identify, execute and realize expected returns and synergies from acquisitions or strategic partnerships or investments, or if we experience integration, financing, or other risks resulting from our acquisitions or strategic partnerships or investments, our financial results may be materially adversely affected.\nAn element of our growth strategy is growth through acquisitions, strategic partnerships and investments. Despite our best efforts to continue pursuing such transactions, there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify suitable strategic partners, investment opportunities or attractive acquisition candidates at acceptable terms. In addition, we may require additional debt or equity financing for future acquisitions and doing so may be made more difficult by the terms of our existing indebtedness.\nOur ability to achieve the expected returns and synergies from our past and future acquisitions, including our recent acquisition of RCA, strategic partnerships and investments depends, in part, upon our ability to effectively leverage or integrate the offerings, technology, sales, administrative functions and personnel of these businesses. We cannot provide assurance that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses, that our acquired businesses will perform at the levels we anticipate or that our strategic partnerships and investments will advance the long-term growth strategy of our company. Our past and future acquisitions, strategic partnerships and investments may subject us to unanticipated risks or liabilities, including the potential to disrupt our operations. Additionally, strategic partnerships may increase our reliance on third parties, which may result in future disruptions if those partnerships are unsuccessful or discontinued or the content or level of support provided by strategic partners is diminished.\nIf we experience a high level of acquisition, strategic partnership or investment-related activity within a limited period of time, the probability that certain of these risks would occur would likely increase. In addition, if we are unsuccessful in completing acquisitions of other businesses or assets, executing strategic partnerships or investments, or if such opportunities for expansion do not arise, our brand or reputation could suffer, and our future growth, business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nOur goodwill and other intangible assets resulting from our acquisitions could be impaired as a result of future business conditions, requiring us to record substantial write-downs that would reduce our operating income.\nWe evaluate the recoverability of recorded goodwill amounts annually or when evidence of potential impairment exists. Intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. These impairment tests are based on several factors requiring management’s judgment. Changes in fair market valuations and our operating performance or business conditions, in general, could result in future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets which could materially adversely affect our results of operations. In addition, if we are not successful in achieving anticipated operating efficiencies associated with acquisitions, our goodwill and intangible assets may become impaired.\nIf we fail to attract or retain the necessary qualified personnel, including through our compensation programs, our business, financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected.\nThe development, maintenance and support of our products and services are dependent upon the knowledge, skills, experience and abilities of our employees. Accordingly, we believe the success of our business depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our executives and other key employees. Although we do not believe that we are overly dependent upon any individual employee, our management and other employees may terminate employment at any time, and the loss of any of our key employees and our inability to replace them with suitable candidates quickly or at all, as well as any negative market perception resulting from such loss, could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition or results of operations. We compete for key employees not only with other companies in our industry but also with companies in other industries, such as software services, engineering services and financial services companies, and there is a limited pool of employees who have the skills and training needed to do our work. If our compensation programs do not adequately engage our key employees or are not competitive, or if we fail to attract, engage and retain the necessary qualified personnel, the quality of our\n30\nproducts and services as well as our ability to support and retain our clients and achieve business objectives may suffer.\nWe cannot provide any guaranty that we will continue to repurchase shares of our common stock pursuant to our share repurchase program.\nThe timing, price and volume of repurchases of shares of our common stock will be based on market conditions, relevant securities laws and other factors. The stock repurchases may be made from time to time, through one or more open market repurchases or privately negotiated transactions, including, without limitation, accelerated share repurchase transactions, trading plans or derivative transactions, or otherwise.\nShare repurchases under our share repurchase program constitute components of our capital return strategy, which we fund with free operating cash flow and borrowings. However, we are not required to make any share repurchases under our share repurchase program. The share repurchase program does not obligate us to repurchase any set dollar amount or number of shares and may be modified, suspended, or terminated at any time without prior notice. The reduction or elimination of our share repurchase program could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. Additionally, the existence of a share repurchase program could cause the market price of our common stock to be higher than it would be in the absence of such a program and could potentially reduce the market liquidity for our shares. As a result, any repurchase program may not ultimately result in enhanced value to our shareholders and may not prove to be the best use of our cash resources."

The operating segments of Real Estate and The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”) do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment.\nOur growth strategy includes: (a) extending leadership in research-enhanced content across asset classes, (b) leading the enablement of ESG and climate investment integration, (c) enhancing distribution and content-enabling technology, (d) expanding solutions that empower client customization, (e) strengthening client relationships and growing into strategic partnerships with clients and (f) executing strategic relationships and acquisitions with complementary content and technology companies. For more information about our Company’s operations, see “\nItem 1: Business\n”.\nKey Financial and Operating Metrics and Drivers\nIn evaluating our financial performance, we focus on revenue and profit growth, including results accounted for under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (“GAAP”) as well as non-GAAP measures, for the Company as a whole and by operating segment.\nWe present revenues disaggregated by types and by segments, which represent our major product lines. We also review expenses by activity, which provides more transparency into how resources are being deployed. In addition, we utilize operating metrics including Run Rate, subscription sales and Retention Rate to manage and assess performance and to provide deeper insights into the recurring portion of our business.\nIn the discussion that follows, we provide certain variances excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and acquisitions. Foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations reflect the difference between the current period results as reported compared to the current period results recalculated using the foreign currency exchange rates in effect for the comparable prior period. While operating revenues adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations includes asset-based fees that have been adjusted for the impact of foreign currency fluctuations, the underlying AUM, which is the primary component of asset-based fees, is not adjusted for foreign currency fluctuations. Approximately three-fifths of the AUM is invested in securities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar, and accordingly, any such impact is excluded from the disclosed foreign currency-adjusted variances.\nRevenues\nOur revenues are presented by type and by reportable segment. For each reportable segment, we present revenues disaggregated by the nature of the revenues, which are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues.\n35\nRecurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts and are generally recognized ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms. The fees are recognized as we provide the product and service to the client over the license period and are generally billed in advance, prior to the license start date.\nAsset-based fees represent fees earned that are variable in nature, as they are calculated based on the AUM linked to our indexes. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are primarily based on trading volumes.\nNon-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal contracts. Non-recurring revenues primarily include revenues from licenses of historical data, indexed derivative financial products, certain implementation services and other special client requests, which are generally recognized at a point in time, but may also be recognized over the license period.\nOperating Expenses\nWe group our operating expenses into the following activity categories:\nCosts are assigned to these activity categories based on the nature of the expense or, when not directly attributable, an estimated allocation based on the type of effort involved. Cost of revenues, selling and marketing, R&D and G&A all include both compensation as well as non-compensation related expenses\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues expenses consist of costs related to the production and servicing of our products and services and primarily includes related information technology costs, including data center, cloud service, platform and infrastructure costs; costs to acquire, produce and maintain market data information; costs of research to support and maintain existing products; costs of product management teams; costs of client service and consultant teams to support customer needs; as well as other support costs directly attributable to the cost of revenues including certain human resources, finance and legal costs.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses consist of costs associated with acquiring new clients or selling new products or product renewals to existing clients and primarily includes the costs of our sales and marketing teams, as well as costs incurred in other departments associated with acquiring new business, including product management, research, technology and sales operations.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses consist of costs to develop new or enhance existing products and the costs to develop new or enhanced technologies and service platforms for the delivery of our products and services and primarily include the costs of development, research, product management, project management and the technology support directly associated with these activities.\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses consist of costs primarily related to finance operations, human resources, office of the CEO, legal, corporate technology, corporate development, impairment charges associated with right of use assets and certain other administrative costs that are not directly attributed, but are instead allocated, to a product or service.\n36\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets expense relates to definite-lived intangible assets arising from past acquisitions and capitalization of internally developed software projects. Intangibles arising from past acquisitions consist of customer relationships, proprietary data, trademarks and trade names and technology and software. We amortize definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. We have no indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements consists of expenses related to depreciating or amortizing the cost of computer and related equipment, leasehold improvements, software and furniture and fixtures over the estimated useful life of the assets.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nOther expense (income), net consists primarily of interest we pay on our outstanding indebtedness, including losses on early extinguishment of debt, income and losses associated with our equity method investment, foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses, interest we collect on cash and short-term investments, as well as other non-operating income and expense items that may arise from time to time.\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\nAdjusted EBITDA\n“Adjusted EBITDA,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as net income before (1) provision for income taxes, (2) other expense (income), net, (3) depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, (4) amortization of intangible assets and, at times, (5) certain other transactions or adjustments, including impairment related to sublease of leased property, certain non-recurring acquisition-related integration and transaction costs and the impact related to the vesting of multi-year restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multi-year total shareholder return targets, which are performance targets with a market condition (the “2016 Multi-Year PSUs”).\n“Adjusted EBITDA expenses,” a non-GAAP measure used by management to assess operating performance, is defined as operating expenses less depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements and amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including impairment related to sublease of leased property, certain non-recurring acquisition-related integration and transaction costs and the impact related to the vesting of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs.\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA expenses are believed to be meaningful measures for management to assess the operating performance of the Company because they adjust for significant one-time, unusual or non-recurring items as well as eliminate the accounting effects of certain capital spending and acquisitions that do not directly affect what management considers to be the Company’s ongoing operating performance in the period. All companies do not calculate adjusted EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA expenses in the same way. These measures can differ significantly from company to company depending on, among other things, long-term strategic decisions regarding capital structure, the tax jurisdictions in which companies operate and capital investments. Accordingly, the Company’s computation of the Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA expenses measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures computed by other companies.\nRun Rate\nRun Rate is a key operating metric and is important because an increase or decrease in our Run Rate ultimately impacts our future operating revenues over time. At the end of any period, we generally have subscription and investment product license agreements in place for a large portion of total revenues for the following 12 months. We measure the fees related to these agreements and refer to this as “Run Rate.” See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nRun Rate\n” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.\n37\nSubscription Sales\nSubscription sales is a key operating metric and is important to management because new subscription sales increase our Run Rate and represent future operating revenues that will be recognized over time. See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nSales\n” below for additional information.\nRetention Rate\nRetention Rate is a key operating metric and is important to management because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. See “—\nOperating Metrics\n—\nRetention Rate\n” below for additional information on the calculation of this metric.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nOur consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with GAAP. These accounting principles require us to make certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. We believe the estimates and judgments upon which we rely are reasonable based upon information available to us at the time these estimates and judgments are made. To the extent there are material differences between these estimates and actual results, our consolidated financial statements will be affected.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded as a result of business combinations undertaken by the Company when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible assets and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1\nst\nand on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist. The test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. In testing goodwill for impairment, the company used the income approach to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit. Under the income approach, we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit based on the present value of estimated future cash flows.  Estimating discounted future cash flows requires significant management judgment including in estimating forecasted future cash flows and determining both discount rates and terminal growth rates.  Forecasted future cash flows are estimated based on a combination of historical experience and assumptions regarding future growth and profitability of each reporting unit.  Discount rates are selected based on discount rates of similar public companies to the reporting unit being valued and terminal growth rates are selected based on consideration of growth rates used during the reporting unit’s forecast period in combination with economic conditions.  These assumptions require management’s judgment and changes to these estimates or assumptions could materially affect the determination of the reporting unit’s fair value. Any impairment is measured as the difference between the carrying amount and its fair value. Based on our quantitative assessment as of July 1, 2021, we determined that the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values, so no impairment of goodwill was recorded.\nDefinite Lived Intangible Assets\nDefinite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable.  These events or circumstances include adverse changes in the manner in which the asset will be used, adverse changes in legal factors related to the asset or negative changes in expected financial performance of the asset, including accumulation of costs and operating losses.  Determining whether an event or changes in circumstances warrant an impairment review involves management judgment.\nOnce it is determined that an impairment review is necessary, determination of recoverability is determined based on comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows.  If the carrying amount exceeds the estimated future undiscounted cash flows, the asset grouping is considered to be impaired. Measurement of impairment for intangible assets is based on the amount the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the asset, which is based on estimated discounted future cash flows. Estimated undiscounted and discounted cash flows used in the determination and calculation of impairments represent management forecasts and require significant management judgment. While management believes that its forecasts are reasonable, differences between forecasts and actual experience could materially affect the valuations.  There were no events or changes in\n38\ncircumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable during the years presented.\nWith respect to our acquisition of RCA on September 13, 2021, the initial valuation of intangible assets, as part of the acquisition method of accounting, is subjective and based, in part, on inputs that are unobservable. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included, forecasted cash flows which were determined based on certain assumptions which included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates. These estimates are inherently uncertain and unpredictable, and if different estimates were used, the purchase price for the acquisition could be allocated to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities differently from the allocation that we have made.\nThe Company amortizes its intangible assets over the estimated period of economic benefit.  If the estimated period of economic benefit is changed, the prospective amortization of the intangible asset could materially change.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company is subject to income taxes in the U.S. and other foreign jurisdictions.  Our tax provision is an estimate based on our understanding of laws in federal, state and foreign tax jurisdictions. These laws can be complicated and are difficult to apply to any business. The tax laws also require us to allocate our taxable income to many jurisdictions based on subjective allocation methodologies and information collection processes.\nProvision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates.  Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when, in our opinion, it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management is required to estimate future taxable income which requires judgment.\nThe Company must regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns and adjust unrecognized tax benefits when additional information is available or when an event occurs.  This assessment requires significant judgment in assessment of tax laws, frequency of tax examinations, and the nature of intercompany transactions and tax positions.\nFactors Affecting the Comparability of Results\nAcquisition of RCA\nOn September 13, 2021, MSCI completed the acquisition of RCA for an aggregate cash purchase price of $949.0 million, subject to working capital adjustments. See Note 5, “Acquisitions,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on the acquisition of RCA.\nResults of Operations\nOperating Revenues\nOur operating revenues are grouped by the following types: recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring. We also group operating revenues by major product or reportable segment as follows: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other – Private Assets, which includes the Real Estate product line and our equity method investment in Burgiss.\nThe following table presents operating revenues by type for the years indicated:\n39\nTotal operating revenues increased 20.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 18.7%.\nOperating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 14.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by strong growth in Index products, which increased $70.2 million, or 12.1%, strong growth in ESG and Climate products, which increased $52.7 million, or 47.9%, strong growth in All Other - Private Assets products, which increased $28.1 million, or 54.5%, and growth in Analytics products, which increased $26.9 million, or 5.3%. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 11.8%.\nOperating revenues from asset-based fees increased 38.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by growth in operating revenues from all index-linked investment product categories. Operating revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes increased by 41.9%, primarily driven by an increase in average AUM, partially offset by a decrease in average basis point fees. The increase in asset-based fees operating revenues was also driven by revenues from non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes which increased by 39.4%, primarily driven by an increase in average AUM.\nTotal operating revenues grew 8.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, total operating revenues would have increased 8.7%.\nOperating revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 8.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by growth in Index products, which increased $49.4 million, or 9.3%, growth in ESG and Climate products, which increased $20.4 million, or 22.8%, and growth in Analytics products, which increased $20.0 million, or 4.1%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, operating revenues from recurring subscriptions would have increased 8.1%.\nOperating revenues from asset-based fees increased 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in asset-based fees was driven by growth in revenues from all of our indexed investment product categories, including an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes that were primarily driven by price increases. The increase in operating revenues from asset-based fees was also driven by higher revenues from non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes, which was driven by price increases and an increase in average AUM. Revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes also increased, driven by an 8.9% increase in average AUM in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by lower fees resulting from the impact of a change in product mix. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating revenues from asset-based fees was negligible.\nThe following table presents the value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes and the sequential change of such assets as of the end of each of the periods indicated:\n40\nThe following table presents the average value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes for the periods indicated:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the average value of AUM in ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes was up $422.9 billion, or 47.7%, compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nThe following table presents operating revenues by reportable segment and revenue type for the years indicated:\nRefer to the section titled “Segment Results” that follows for further discussion of segment revenues.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses increased 19.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the increase would have been 18.2%.\nTotal operating expenses increased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, the increase would have been 1.6%.\n41\nThe following table presents operating expenses by activity\ncategory\nfor the years indicated:\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues increased 23.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting increases across all segments. The change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries and incentive compensation and benefits costs, as well as higher non-compensation costs, primarily reflecting higher professional fees, information technology costs and market data costs.\nCost of revenues decreased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was driven by the absence of $7.0 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by increases in other compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries, as well as higher non-compensation costs, reflecting higher information technology costs, partially offset by lower travel and entertainment costs. Cost of revenues reflects increases across the ESG and Climate and Index reportable segments, partially offset by decreases in the Analytics and All Other – Private Assets reportable segments.\nSelling and Marketing\nSelling and marketing expenses increased 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting increases across all segments. The change was primarily driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, including higher incentive compensation, wages and salaries and benefits costs, partially offset by a decline in severance costs.\nSelling and marketing expenses decreased 1.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was driven by lower non-compensation costs, including travel and entertainment costs, and the absence of $4.5 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019, partially offset by increases in compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries. Selling and marketing expenses reflect increases across the ESG and Climate, Analytics and All Other – Private Assets reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in the Index reportable segment.\nResearch and Development\nR&D expenses increased 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily reflecting higher investment in the Index and ESG and Climate reportable segments, partially offset by lower investment in the Analytics reportable segment. The change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher incentive compensation, as well as higher non-compensation costs, reflecting higher information technology costs.\nR&D expenses increased 2.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, including wages and salaries and benefits costs. R&D expenses reflect higher investments in the All Other – Private Assets, Index and ESG and Climate reportable segments, partially offset by lower investment in the Analytics reportable segment.\n42\nGeneral and Administrative\nG&A expenses increased 29.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting increases across all segments. The change was driven by increases in non-compensation costs, primarily relating to impairment charges associated with right of use assets, non-recurring transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of RCA and higher information technology costs and professional fees. The change was also driven by higher compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher wages and salaries and incentive compensation.\nG&A expenses increased 4.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The change was driven by increases in compensation and benefits costs, primarily relating to higher incentive compensation and wages and salaries, partially offset by the absence of $3.5 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 and lower non-compensation costs. G&A expenses reflect increases across the ESG and Climate, Analytics and Index reportable segments, partially offset by a decrease in the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment.\nThe following table presents operating expenses using compensation and non-compensation categories, rather than using activity categories, for the years indicated:\nA significant portion of the incentive compensation component of operating expenses is based on the achievement of a number of financial and operating metrics. In a scenario where operating revenue growth and profitability moderate, incentive compensation would be expected to decrease accordingly.\nFixed costs constitute a significant portion of the non-compensation component of operating expenses. The discretionary non-compensation component of operating expenses could, however, be reduced in the near-term in a scenario where operating revenue growth moderates.\nWe had 4,303 employees as of December 31, 2021, compared to 3,633 employees as of December 31, 2020, reflecting a 18.4% growth in the number of employees. Continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. As of December 31, 2021, 63.2% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 64.6% as of December 31, 2020.\nCompensation and benefits costs increased 16.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by headcount growth and higher incentive compensation.\nNon-compensation expenses increased 25.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by higher information technology costs, professional fees, impairment charges associated with right of use assets, non-recurring transaction and integration costs related to the acquisition of RCA and market data costs.\nWe had 3,633 employees as of December 31, 2020 compared to 3,396 employees as of December 31, 2019, reflecting a 7.0% growth in the number of employees. Continued growth of our emerging market centers around the world is an important factor in our ability to manage and control the growth of our compensation and benefits costs. As of December 31, 2020, 64.6% of our employees were located in emerging market centers compared to 62.9% as of December 31, 2019.\n43\nCompensation and benefits costs increased 1.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, driven by higher wages and salaries, incentive compensation and benefits costs, partially offset by the absence of $15.4 million of payroll tax expense associated with the vesting of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nNon-compensation expenses decreased 3.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower travel and entertainment and marketing costs, partially offset by higher information technology costs.\nAmortization of Intangible Assets\nAmortization of intangible assets expense increased 41.5% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by a write-off of $16.0 million of certain internally developed capitalized software intangible assets following management’s decision to discontinue development and cease related sales activities of certain Analytics segment products and transition existing customers to other product offerings, as well as additional amortization recognized on acquired intangible assets following the acquisition of RCA.\nAmortization of intangible assets expense increased 15.2% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher amortization of internally-developed capitalized software.\nDepreciation and Amortization of Property, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements decreased 3.0% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The decrease was primarily the result of lower amortization on software and depreciation on computer and related equipment, partially offset by impairment charges on leasehold improvements.\nDepreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements for the year ended December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $29.8 million and $30.0 million, respectively.\nOther Expense (Income), Net\nThe following table shows our other expense (income), net for the years indicated:\nOther expense (income), net increased 8.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020. The increase in net expenses was primarily driven by the approximately $37.3 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2027 Senior Notes (the “2027 Senior Notes Redemption”) and $21.8 million expense from the redemption of all of the $500.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2026 Senior Notes (the “2026 Senior Notes Redemption”) during the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2027 Senior Notes Redemption included an applicable premium of approximately $33.6 million (as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2027 Senior Notes) and the write-off of approximately $3.7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2027 Senior Notes. The loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2026 Senior Notes Redemption included an applicable premium of approximately $18.2 million (as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2026 Senior Notes) and the write-off of approximately $3.6 million of unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the 2026 Senior Notes.\n44\nThe increase in net expenses was partially offset by the absence of the $35.0 million and $10.0 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the outstanding $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes and the redemption of all of the remaining $300.0 million of the 5.250% Senior\nNotes due 2024 during the year ended December 31, 2020, respectively, and by a one-time gain of $7.0 million related to the gain resulting from changes in\nour\nownership interest of\nBurgiss\n.\nOther expense (income), net increased 30.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in net expenses was primarily driven by the $35.0 million and $10.0 million loss on debt extinguishment associated with the redemption of all of the outstanding $800.0 million aggregate principal amount of the 2025 Senior Notes (“2025 Senior Notes Redemption”) and the redemption of all of the remaining $300.0 million of the 2024 Senior Notes (“2024 Senior Notes Redemption”), respectively.\nThe loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2025 Senior Notes Redemption included an applicable premium of approximately $29.5 million (as defined in the indenture governing the terms of the 2025 Senior Notes) and the write-off of approximately $5.5 million of unamortized debt issuance costs. The loss on debt extinguishment associated with the 2024 Senior Notes Redemption included a redemption price of approximately $7.9 million (as set forth in the indenture governing the terms of the 2024 Senior Notes) and the write-off of approximately $2.1 million of unamortized debt issuance costs.\nIn addition, the increase in net expenses reflects higher interest expense associated with the higher outstanding debt and lower interest income due to lower rates earned on cash balances, offset by the absence of the $16.8 million loss on extinguishment associated with the partial pre-maturity redemption of the 2024 Senior Notes recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019.\nIncome Taxes\nThe following table shows our income tax provision and effective tax rate for the years indicated:\nThe effective tax rate of 15.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021, reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $28.3 million, in relation to pretax income, primarily related to $22.7 million of excess tax benefits recognized on share-based compensation vested during the period, a $5.1 million benefit related to prior year settlements, a $2.3 million benefit related to the revaluation of deferred taxes as a result of the enactment of an increase in the UK corporate tax rate and a $2.0 million benefit related to the filing of prior year refund claims, partially offset by a $3.8 million expense related to other prior year items. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by the level of earnings.\nThe effective tax rate of 12.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020, reflects the impact of certain discrete items totaling $47.9 million. These discrete items primarily relate to $22.2 million of excess tax benefits recognized on the vesting of equity awards during the period and $20.8 million released during the year related to the favorable impact on prior years from final regulations clarifying certain provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act that was enacted on December 22, 2017 (“Tax Reform”). Also included in the discrete items is a $6.3 million benefit related to the revaluation of the cost of deemed repatriation of foreign earnings.\nThe effective tax rate of 6.6% for the year ended December 31, 2019, reflects the impact of certain favorable discrete items totaling $85.7 million. These discrete items primarily relate to $66.6 million of excess tax benefits recognized upon vesting of the 2016 Multi-Year PSUs and $16.1 million of excess tax benefits on other share-based compensation recognized during the period. In addition, the effective tax rate was impacted by a beneficial geographic mix of earnings.\n45\nNet Income\nThe following table shows our net income for the years indicated:\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income increased 20.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020.\nAs a result of the factors described above, net income increased 6.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019.\nWeighted Average Shares and Common Shares Outstanding\nThe following table shows our weighted average shares and common shares outstanding for the years indicated:\nThe decrease in weighted average shares and common shares outstanding primarily reflects the impact of share repurchases made pursuant to the stock repurchase program.\nAdjusted EBITDA\nThe following table presents the calculation of the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure for the years indicated:\nThe increase in Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin reflects a higher rate of growth in operating revenues as compared to the rate of growth of Adjusted EBITDA expenses, driven by the factors previously described.\n46\nReconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to Net Income and Adjusted EBITDA Expenses to Operating Expenses\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA to net income for the years indicated:\nThe following table presents the reconciliation of Adjusted EBITDA expenses to operating expenses for the years indicated:\nSegment Results\nThe results for each of our four reportable segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are presented below:\n47\nIndex Segment\nThe following table presents the results for the Index segment for the years indicated:\nIndex operating revenues increased 23.1% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by growth from asset-based fees and recurring subscriptions. Revenues from recurring subscriptions increased 12.1%, primarily driven by growth from market cap-weighted index products and factor, ESG and climate index products. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Index operating revenues was negligible.\nOperating revenues from asset-based fees increased 38.6% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, driven by growth in operating revenues from all index-linked investment product categories. Operating revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI equity indexes increased by 41.9%, primarily driven by an increase in average AUM, partially offset by a decrease in average basis point fees. The increase in asset-based fees operating revenues was also driven by revenues from non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes which increased by 39.4%, primarily driven by an increase in average AUM.\nNon-recurring operating revenues increased 29.8% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by client license and usage fees related to prior periods, as well as licenses to derivatives products.\nIndex segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 20.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting higher compensation expenses to support growth across all expense activity categories. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Index segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 18.3%.\nIndex operating revenues increased 10.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. Revenues from recurring subscriptions were up 9.3%. The increase was primarily driven by growth in market cap-weighted index products, strong growth in factor, ESG and climate and in custom index products. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on revenues from recurring subscriptions was negligible.\nOperating revenues from asset-based fees increased 10.5% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019. The increase in asset-based fees was driven by growth in revenues from all of our indexed investment product categories, including an increase in revenues from exchange traded futures and options contracts linked to MSCI indexes that were primarily driven by price increases. The increase in revenues from asset-based fees was also driven by higher revenues from non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes, which was driven by price increases and an increase in average AUM. Revenues from ETFs linked to MSCI indexes also increased, driven by an 8.9% increase in average AUM in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by a change in fee levels of certain products as well as change in product mix. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on operating revenues from asset-based fees was negligible.\nIndex segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses decreased 0.3% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting lower expenses across selling and marketing expense activity category, partially offset by higher expenses across the G&A, cost of revenues and R&D expense activity categories.\n48\nAdjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations,\nIndex segment\nAdjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 0.2%.\nAnalytics Segment\nThe following table presents the results for the Analytics segment for the years indicated:\nAnalytics operating revenues increased 5.9% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by growth from recurring subscriptions related to Multi-Asset Class and Equity Analytics products. The impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on Analytics operating revenues was negligible.\nAnalytics segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 1.4% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting higher compensation expenses primarily driven by the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on compensation expenses and higher market data costs, partially offset by lower R&D expenses. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Analytics segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 0.1%.\nAnalytics operating revenues increased 3.4% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by growth in Multi-Asset Class Analytics products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Analytics operating revenues would have increased 3.3%.\nAnalytics segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses decreased 1.1% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by lower expenses across the cost of revenues and R&D expense activity categories, partially offset by higher expenses across the selling and marketing and G&A expense activity categories. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Analytics segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have decreased 0.4%.\nESG and Climate Segment\nThe following table presents the results for the ESG and Climate segment for the years indicated:\nESG and Climate operating revenues increased 49.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by growth from recurring subscriptions related to Ratings, Climate\n49\nand Screening products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, ESG and Climate operating revenues would have increased 43.4%.\nESG and Climate segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 54.2% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, reflecting higher compensation expenses to support growth, reflected across all expense activity categories. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, ESG and Climate segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 51.8%.\nESG and Climate operating revenues increased 22.8% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by strong growth from recurring subscriptions related to Ratings, Climate, and Screening products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, ESG and Climate operating revenues would have increased 22.3%.\nESG and Climate segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 28.6% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, reflecting higher compensation expenses to support growth, reflected across all expense activity categories. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, ESG and Climate segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 28.4%.\nAll Other – Private Assets Segment\nThe following table presents the results for the All Other – Private Assets segment for the years indicated:\nAll Other – Private Assets operating revenues increased 51.3% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by revenues attributable to the acquisition of RCA included as of September 13, 2021 (the date we completed the acquisition). Excluding the acquisition of RCA, the increase in operating revenues was primarily driven by growth from recurring subscriptions related to both Enterprise Analytics and Global Intel products and benefits from foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. Adjusting for both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other – Private Assets operating revenues would have increased 4.0%. All Other - Private Assets operating revenues would have increased 10.0% when excluding the impact of acquisitions and increased 45.3% when excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAll Other – Private Assets segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 44.7% for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020, primarily driven by the acquisition of RCA. All Other - Private Assets segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have decreased 0.2% when excluding the impact of acquisitions and increased 41.9% when excluding the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations.\nAll Other – Private Assets operating revenues increased 9.0% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by growth from recurring subscriptions related to both Enterprise Analytics and Global Intel products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other – Private Assets operating revenues would have increased 9.2%.\nAll Other – Private Assets segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses increased 3.7% for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared to the year ended December 31, 2019, primarily driven by higher expenses across the R&D and selling and marketing expense activity categories, partially offset by lower expenses across the cost of revenues and\n50\nG&A expense activity categories. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other – Private Assets segment Adjusted EBITDA expenses would have increased 4.8%.\nOperating Metrics\nRun Rate\n“Run Rate” estimates at a particular point in time the annualized value of the recurring revenues under our client license agreements (“Client Contracts”) for the next 12 months, assuming all Client Contracts that come up for renewal, or reach the end of the committed subscription period, are renewed and assuming then-current currency exchange rates, subject to the adjustments and exclusions described below. For any Client Contract where fees are linked to an investment product’s assets or trading volume/fees, the Run Rate calculation reflects, for ETFs, the market value on the last trading day of the period, for futures and options, the most recent quarterly volumes and/or reported exchange fees, and for other non-ETF products, the most recent client-reported assets. Run Rate does not include fees associated with “one-time” and other non-recurring transactions. In addition, we add to Run Rate the annualized fee value of recurring new sales, whether to existing or new clients, when we execute Client Contracts, even though the license start date, and associated revenue recognition, may not be effective until a later date. We remove from Run Rate the annualized fee value associated with products or services under any Client Contract with respect to which we have received a notice of termination, non-renewal or an indication the client does not intend to continue their subscription during the period and have determined that such notice evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable products or services, even though such notice is not effective until a later date.\nChanges in our recurring revenues typically lag changes in Run Rate. The actual amount of recurring revenues we will realize over the following 12 months will differ from Run Rate for numerous reasons, including:\n51\nThe following table presents Run Rates by reportable segment as of the dates indicated and the growth percentages over the years indicated:\nDecember 31, 2021 Compared to December 31, 2020\nTotal Run Rate increased 20.3%, driven by an 18.0% increase from recurring subscriptions and 27.0% increase from asset-based fees. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recurring subscriptions Run Rate would have increased 12.4% and 19.0%, respectively.\nRun Rate from Index asset-based fees increased 27.0%, primarily driven by higher AUM in ETFs and non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes, partially offset by a 0.13 average basis point fee decrease in ETFs.\nRun Rate from Index recurring subscriptions increased 12.3%, primarily driven by growth from market cap-weighted index products and strong growth from factor, ESG and climate index products and reflected growth across all regions and client segments.\nRun Rate from Analytics products increased 5.4%, primarily driven by growth in both Multi-Asset Class and Equity Analytics products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Analytics Run Rate would have increased 6.8%.\nRun Rate from ESG and Climate products increased 44.3%, driven by growth in all products, primarily driven by growth in Ratings, Climate and Screening products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency, ESG and Climate Run Rate would have increased 47.1%.\nRun Rate from All Other - Private Assets increased 139.2%, primarily driven by the acquisition of RCA and growth in the Global Intel products. Adjusting for both the impact of acquisitions and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other - Private Assets Run Rate would have increased 7.6%. Adjusting for the impact of acquisitions or foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other - Private Assets Run Rate would have increased 4.7% and 143.5%, respectively.\nDecember 31, 2020 Compared to December 31, 2019\nTotal Run Rate grew 12.1%. Recurring subscription Run Rate grew 10.5%. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, recurring subscriptions Run Rate would have increased 9.4%.\n52\nRun Rate from asset-based fees increased 17.2%, driven by higher AUM in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes, higher prices in futures and options and higher prices in non-ETF indexed funds linked to MSCI indexes. Partially offsetting the impact of the increase in AUM in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes was a change in fee levels of certain products as well as change in product mix, which was the primary driver of a decline in average basis point fees to 2.67\nat\nDecember 31, 2020 from 2.82 at December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2020, the value of AUM in equity ETFs linked to MSCI indexes was $1,103.6 billion, up $169.2 billion, or 18.1%, from $934.4 billion as of December 31, 2019. The increase of $169.2 billion consisted of market appreciation of $93.6 billion and net inflows of $75.6 billion.\nIndex recurring subscription Run Rate grew 10.6%, primarily driven by strong growth in market cap-weighted index products, custom and specialized index products and factor and ESG and climate index products.\nRun Rate from Analytics products increased 5.4%, driven by growth in both Multi-Asset Class and Equity Analytics products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, Analytics Run Rate would have increased 4.0%.\nRun Rate from ESG and Climate products increased 36.4%, primarily driven by strong growth in Ratings and Climate products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, ESG and Climate Run Rate would have increased 32.6%.\nRun Rate from All Other - Private Assets increased 11.2%, primarily driven by growth in both Enterprise Analytics and Global Intel products. Adjusting for the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations, All Other – Private Assets Run Rate would have increased 6.6%.\nSales\nSales represents the annualized value of products and services clients commit to purchase from MSCI and will result in additional operating revenues. Non-recurring sales represent the actual value of the customer agreements entered into during the period and are not a component of Run Rate. New recurring subscription sales represent additional selling activities, such as new customer agreements, additions to existing agreements or increases in price that occurred during the period and are additions to Run Rate. Subscription cancellations reflect client activities during the period, such as discontinuing products and services and/or reductions in price, resulting in reductions to Run Rate. Net new recurring subscription sales represent the amount of new recurring subscription sales net of subscription cancellations during the period, which reflects the net impact to Run Rate during the period.\nTotal gross sales represent the sum of new recurring subscription sales and non-recurring sales. Total net sales represent the total gross sales net of the impact from subscription cancellations.\n53\nThe following table presents our recurring subscription sales,\ncancellations\nand non-recurring sales by reportable segment for the years indicated:\n54\nRetention Rate\nAnother key metric is our “Retention Rate.” The following table presents our Retention Rate by reportable segment for the periods indicated:\nRetention Rate is an important metric because subscription cancellations decrease our Run Rate and ultimately our future operating revenues over time. The annual Retention Rate represents the retained subscription Run Rate (subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year less actual cancels during the year) as a percentage of the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year.\nThe Retention Rate for a non-annual period is calculated by annualizing the cancellations for which we have received a notice of termination or for which we believe there is an intention not to renew or discontinue the subscription during the non-annual period, and we believe that such notice or intention evidences the client’s final decision to terminate or not renew the applicable agreement, even though such notice is not effective until a later date. This annualized cancellation figure is then divided by the subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the fiscal year to calculate a cancellation rate. This cancellation rate is then subtracted from 100% to derive the annualized Retention Rate for the period.\nFor example, in the fourth quarter of 2021, we recorded cancellations of $20.3 million. To derive the Retention Rate for the fourth quarter, we annualized the actual cancellations during the quarter of $20.3 million to derive $81.4 million of annualized cancellations. This $81.4 million was then divided by the $1,444.2 million subscription Run Rate at the beginning of the year, which included RCA's Run Rate as of the date of acquisition, to derive a cancellation rate of 5.6%. The 5.6% was then subtracted from 100.0% to derive a Retention Rate of 94.4% for the fourth quarter.\nRetention Rate is computed by operating segment on a product/service-by-product/service basis. In general, if a client reduces the number of products or services to which it subscribes within a segment, or switches between products or services within a segment, we treat it as a cancellation for purposes of calculating our Retention Rate except in the case of a product or service switch that management considers to be a replacement product or service. In those replacement cases, only the net change to the client subscription, if a decrease, is reported as a cancel. In the Analytics and the ESG and Climate operating segments, substantially all product or service switches are treated as replacement products or services and netted in this manner, while in our Index and Real Estate operating segments, product or service switches that are treated as replacement products or services and receive netting treatment occur\n55\nonly in certain limited instances. In addition, we treat any reduction in fees resulting from a down-\nsell\nof the same product or service as a cancellation to the extent of the reduction. We do not calculate Retention Rate for that portion of our Run Rate attributable to assets in index\n-linked\ninvestment products or futures and options contracts, in each case, linked to our indexes.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, 29.0% of our cancellations occurred in the fourth quarter. In our product lines, Retention Rate is generally higher during the first three quarters and lower in the fourth quarter, as the fourth quarter is traditionally the largest renewal period in the year.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nWe require capital to fund ongoing operations, internal growth initiatives and acquisitions. Our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from our operations, existing cash and cash equivalents and credit capacity under our existing credit facility. In addition, we believe we have access to additional funding in the public and private markets. We intend to use these sources of liquidity to, among other things, service our existing and future debt obligations, fund our working capital requirements for capital expenditures, investments, acquisitions and dividend payments, and make repurchases of our common stock. In connection with our business strategy, we regularly evaluate acquisition and strategic partnership opportunities. We believe our liquidity, along with other financing alternatives, will provide the necessary capital to fund these transactions and achieve our planned growth.\nSenior Notes and Credit Agreement\nWe have an aggregate of $4,200.0 million in senior unsecured notes (collectively, the “Senior Notes”) outstanding and a $500.0 million undrawn Revolving Credit Agreement with a syndicate of banks as of December 31, 2021. See Note 6, “Commitments and Contingencies,” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on the Senior Notes and Revolving Credit Agreement.\nThe Senior Notes and the Revolving Credit Agreement are fully and unconditionally, and jointly and severally, guaranteed by our direct or indirect wholly owned domestic subsidiaries that account for more than 5% of our and our subsidiaries’ consolidated assets, other than certain excluded subsidiaries (the “subsidiary guarantors”). Amounts due under the Revolving Credit Agreement are our and the subsidiary guarantors’ senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with the Senior Notes and any of our other unsecured, unsubordinated debt, senior to any of our subordinated debt and effectively subordinated to our secured debt to the extent of the assets securing such debt.\nThe indentures governing our Senior Notes (the “Indentures”) among us, each of the subsidiary guarantors, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee, contain covenants that limit our and certain of our subsidiaries’ ability to, among other things, incur liens, enter into sale/leaseback transactions and consolidate, merge or sell all or substantially all of our assets. In addition, the Indentures restrict our non-guarantor subsidiaries’ ability to create, assume, incur or guarantee additional indebtedness without such non-guarantor subsidiaries guaranteeing the Senior Notes on a\npari passu\nbasis.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement contains affirmative and restrictive covenants that, among other things, limit our ability and/or the ability of our existing or future subsidiaries to:\n56\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement and the Indentures also contain customary events of default, including those relating to non-payment, breach of representations, warranties or covenants, cross-default and cross-acceleration, and bankruptcy and insolvency events, and, in the case of the Revolving Credit Agreement, invalidity or impairment of loan documentation, change of control and customary ERISA defaults in addition to the foregoing. None of the restrictions above are expected to impact our ability to effectively operate the business.\nThe Revolving Credit Agreement also requires us and our subsidiaries to achieve financial and operating results sufficient to maintain compliance with the following financial ratios on a consolidated basis through the termination of the Revolving Credit Agreement: (1) the maximum Consolidated Leverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall not exceed 4.25:1.00 (or 4.50:1.00 for two fiscal quarters following a material acquisition) and (2) the minimum Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio (as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement) measured quarterly on a rolling four-quarter basis shall be at least 4.00:1.00. As of December 31, 2021, our Consolidated Leverage Ratio was 3.28:1.00 and our Consolidated Interest Coverage Ratio was 8.27:1.00. As of December 31, 2021, there were no amounts drawn and outstanding under the Revolving Credit Agreement.\nOur non-guarantor subsidiaries under the Senior Notes consist of: (i) domestic subsidiaries of the Company that account for 5% or less of consolidated assets of the Company and its subsidiaries and (ii) any foreign or domestic subsidiary of the Company that is deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation within the meaning of Section 957 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. Our non-guarantor subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021, accounted for approximately $1,258.4 million, or 61.6%, of our total revenue for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, approximately $452.2 million, or 42.2%, of our consolidated operating income for the 12 months ended December 31, 2021, and approximately $2,334.9 million, or 42.4%, of our consolidated total assets (excluding intercompany assets) and $1,004.6 million, or 17.7%, of our consolidated total liabilities, in each case as of December 31, 2021.\nShare Repurchases\nOur Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program for the purchase of shares of the Company’s common stock in the open market. See Note 11, “Shareholders’ Equity (Deficit),” of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for additional information on our stock repurchase program.\nAs of trade date February 10, 2022, a total of $955.1 million remained available on the share repurchase authorization. This authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice.\nCash Dividends\nOn September 17, 2014, our Board of Directors approved a plan to initiate a regular quarterly cash dividend to our shareholders. On October 30, 2014, we began paying regular quarterly cash dividends and have paid such dividends each quarter thereafter.\nOn January 24, 2022, the Board of Directors declared a quarterly dividend of $1.04 per share of common stock to be paid on February 28, 2022 to shareholders of record as of the close of trading on February 18, 2022.\n57\nCash Flows\nThe following table presents the Company’s cash and cash equivalents as of the dates indicated:\nThe following table presents the breakdown of the Company’s cash flows for the periods indicated:\nnm: not meaningful\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nWe typically seek to maintain minimum cash balances globally of approximately $200.0 million to $250.0 million for general operating purposes. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, $542.2 million and $423.4 million, respectively, of the cash and cash equivalents were held by foreign subsidiaries. Repatriation of some foreign cash may be subject to certain withholding taxes in local jurisdictions and other distribution restrictions. We believe the global cash and cash equivalent balances that are maintained will be available to meet our global needs whether for general corporate purposes or other needs, including acquisitions or expansion of our products.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nCash flows from operating activities consist of net income adjusted for certain non-cash items and changes in assets and liabilities. The year-over-year increase for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by higher cash collections from customers, partially offset by higher payments for income taxes and cash expenses.\nOur primary uses of cash from operating activities are for the payment of cash compensation expenses, interest expenses, income taxes, technology costs, market data costs and office rent. Historically, the payment of cash for compensation and benefits is at its highest level in the first quarter when we pay discretionary employee compensation related to the previous fiscal year.\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nThe year-over-year change for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the acquisition of RCA, partially offset by the absence of the $190.8 million equity method investment in Burgiss.\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nThe year-over-year change for the year ended December 31, 2021 compared to the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily driven by the impact of lower share repurchases and higher proceeds from the senior notes offerings made during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n58\nWe believe that global cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents\nand funds available under our existing\nrevolving\ncredit facility and our ability to access the debt and capital markets for additional funds\n, will continue to be sufficient to fund our global operating activities and cash commitments for investing and financing activities, such as material capital expenditures and share repurchases, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter. In addition, we expect that foreign cash flows from operations, together with existing cash and cash equivalents, will continue to be sufficient to fund our foreign operating activities and cash commitments for investing activities, such as material capital expenditures, for at least the 12 months following issuance of this Form 10-K and for the foreseeable future thereafter.\nContractual Obligations\nOur contractual obligations consist primarily of our debt obligations arising from the issuance of the Senior Notes, leases for office space, leases for equipment and other operating leases and obligations to vendors arising out of market data contracts. The following table summarizes our contractual obligations for the periods indicated as of December 31, 2021:\nThe obligations related to our uncertain tax positions, which are not considered material, have been excluded from the table above because of the uncertainty surrounding the timing and final amounts of any settlement.\nRecent Accounting Standards Updates\nSee Note 2, “Recent Accounting Standards Updates,” of the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements included herein for further information."

    "text": "Foreign Currency Risk\nWe are subject to foreign currency exchange fluctuation risk. Exchange rate movements can impact the U.S. dollar-reported value of our revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities denominated in non-U.S. dollar currencies or where the currency of such items is different than the functional currency of the entity where these items were recorded.\nWe generally invoice our clients in U.S. dollars; however, we invoice a portion of our clients in Euros, British pounds sterling, Japanese yen and a limited number of other non-U.S. dollar currencies. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 15.1% and 14.1%, respectively, of our revenues were subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk and primarily included clients billed in foreign currency as well as U.S. dollar exposures on non-U.S. dollar foreign operating entities. Of the 15.1% of non-U.S. dollar exposure for the year ended December 31, 2021, 41.6% was in Euros, 26.5% was in British pounds sterling and 23.8% was in Japanese yen. Of the 14.1% of non-U.S. dollar exposure for the year ended December 31, 2020, 40.2% was in Euros, 27.2% was in Japanese yen and 24.6% was in British pounds sterling.\nRevenues from asset-based fees represented 27.1% and 23.6% of operating revenues for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. While a substantial portion of our asset-based fees are invoiced in U.S. dollars, the fees are based on the assets in investment products, of which approximately three-fifths are invested in\n59\nsecurities denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, declines in such other currencies against the U.S. dollar will decrease the fees payable to us under such licenses. In addition, declines in such currencies against the U.S. dollar could impact the attractiveness of such investment products resulting in net fund outflows, which would further reduce the fees payable under such licenses.\nWe are exposed to additional foreign currency risk in certain of our operating costs. Approximately 41.1% and 40.8% of our operating expenses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, were denominated in foreign currencies, the significant majority of which were denominated in British pounds sterling, Indian rupees, Hungarian forints, Euros, Swiss francs, Mexican pesos and Hong Kong dollars.\nWe have certain monetary assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than local functional amounts and when these balances are remeasured into their local functional currency, either a gain or a loss results from the change of the value of the functional currency as compared to the originating currencies. We manage foreign currency exchange rate risk, in part, through the use of derivative financial instruments comprised principally of forward contracts on foreign currency which are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes. The objective of the derivative instruments is to minimize the impact on the income statement of the volatility of amounts denominated in certain foreign currencies. We recognized total foreign currency exchange losses of $1.9 million for the year ended December 31, 2021 and foreign currency exchange losses of $2.8 million for the year ended December 31, 2020.\n60"

We also have audited the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nIn our opinion, the consolidated financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework\n(2013) issued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company's management is responsible for these consolidated financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in Management's Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting appearing under Item 9A. Our responsibility is to express opinions on the Company’s consolidated financial statements and on the Company's internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the consolidated financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the consolidated financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the consolidated financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nAs described in Management’s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting, management has excluded Real Capital Analytics, Inc. from its assessment of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, because it was acquired by the Company in a purchase business combination during 2021. We have also excluded Real Capital Analytics, Inc. from our audit of internal control over financial reporting. Real Capital Analytics, Inc. is a wholly-owned subsidiary whose total assets and total operating revenues excluded from management’s assessment and our audit of internal control over financial reporting represent 0.9% and 1.1%, respectively, of the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n62\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current period audit of the consolidated financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (i) relates to accounts or disclosures that are material to the consolidated financial statements and (ii) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matter below, providing a separate opinion on the critical audit matter or on the accounts or disclosures to which it relates.\nAcquisition of Real Capital Analytics, Inc. - Valuation of Customer Relationships and Proprietary Data Intangible Assets\nAs described in Note 5 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company completed the acquisition of Real Capital Analytics, Inc. for an aggregate cash purchase price of $949 million in 2021, which resulted in $394 million of acquired intangible assets, including customer relationships of $176 million and proprietary data of $186 million, being recorded. The fair values of acquired intangible assets were determined using the relief from royalty method, the replacement cost method and multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included, forecasted cash flows which were determined based on certain assumptions which included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates, and discount rates.\nThe principal considerations for our determination that performing procedures relating to the valuation of customer relationships and proprietary data intangible assets acquired in the Real Capital Analytics, Inc. acquisition is a critical audit matter are (i) the significant judgment by management when developing the fair value of the customer relationships and proprietary data intangible assets acquired; (ii) a high degree of auditor judgment, subjectivity, and effort in performing procedures and evaluating  management’s aforementioned significant assumptions related to forecasted cash flows, expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates, and discount rates; and (iii) the audit effort involved the use of professionals with specialized skill and knowledge.\nAddressing the matter involved performing procedures and evaluating audit evidence in connection with forming our overall opinion on the consolidated financial statements. These procedures included testing the effectiveness of controls relating to the acquisition accounting, including controls over management’s valuation of the customer relationships and proprietary data intangible assets and controls over the development of the aforementioned significant assumptions related to forecasted cash flows, expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates, and discount rates. These procedures also included, among others (i) reading the purchase agreement and (ii) testing management’s process for developing the fair value of the customer relationships and proprietary data intangible assets. Testing management’s process included (i) evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation methods; (ii) testing the completeness and accuracy of data provided by management; and (iii) evaluating the reasonableness of the aforementioned significant assumptions related to forecasted cash flows, expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates, and discount rates for the customer relationships and proprietary data intangible assets. Evaluating the reasonableness of the forecasted cash flows involved considering company specific factors and the past performance of the acquired business and comparable businesses. Professionals with specialized skill and knowledge were used to assist in the evaluation of the appropriateness of the valuation methods and in the evaluation of the reasonableness of certain significant assumptions related to the forecasted cash flows as well as the expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates, and discount rates.\n/s/\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP\nNew York, New York\nFebruary 11, 2022\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 2014.\n63\nMSCI INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n64\nMSCI INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n65\nMSCI INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n66\nMSCI INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n67\nMSCI INC.\nCONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n68\nMSCI INC.\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n1. INTRODUCTION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION\nOrganization\nMSCI Inc., together with its wholly owned subsidiaries (the “Company” or “MSCI”) is a leading provider of critical decision support tools and solutions for the global investment community. Our mission-critical offerings help investors address the challenges of a transforming investment landscape and power better investment decisions. Leveraging our knowledge of the global investment process and our expertise in research, data and technology, we enable our clients to understand and analyze key drivers of risk and return and confidently and efficiently build more effective portfolios. Our products and services include indexes; portfolio construction and risk management tools; environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) and climate solutions; and real estate market and transaction data and analysis.\nBasis of Presentation\nThe consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to financial statements, which include the accounts of MSCI Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries, are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”).\nCertain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation. Effective January 1, 2021, the ESG and Climate operating segment is being presented as a separate reportable segment. The operating segments of Real Estate and The Burgiss Group, LLC (“Burgiss”) do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had an approximately $\n218.8\nmillion equity method investment in Burgiss, representing a\n33.6\n% equity ownership.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nBasis of Financial Statements and Use of Estimates\nThe Company makes certain estimates and judgments that can affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements, as well as the reported amounts of operating revenues and expenses during the periods presented. Significant estimates and judgments made by management include such examples as assessment of impairment of goodwill and intangible assets and income taxes. The Company believes that estimates used in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are reasonable; however, actual results could differ materially from these estimates. Inter-company balances and transactions are eliminated in consolidation.\nRevenue Recognition\nPerformance Obligations and Transaction Price\nThe Company recognizes revenues for products and services when performance obligations are satisfied. For revenue arrangements containing multiple products or services, the Company accounts for the individual products or services as a separate performance obligation if they are distinct. A product or service is distinct if a client can benefit from it either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available to the client, and the Company’s promise to transfer the product or service to the client is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract.  If both criteria are not met, the promised products or services are accounted for as a combined performance obligation.\nThe transaction price is the amount of consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring products or services to the client. The Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation identified in the contract based on the best estimate of a relative standalone selling price of each distinct product or service in the contract. To allocate the transaction price to each performance obligation on a relative standalone selling price basis, at contract inception the Company determines the standalone selling prices of the distinct products or services underlying each performance obligation in proportion to the total transaction price. This standalone selling price may be the contract price but is more often than not the best estimate of the price the\n69\nCompany would receive for selling the product or service separately in similar circumstances and to other similar customers. A client can receive a discount for purchasing a bundle of products or services if the sum of the standalone selling price of those promised products or services in the contract exceeds the promised consideration in the contract.\nFor services where the transaction price is variable based upon assets under management (“AUM”), volume of trades, fee levels or number of investments linked to MSCI’s indexes, the transaction price is based upon pricing models and is not allocated at the inception of the contract but rather falls within the sales and usage-based royalty exception under which the price and associated revenue are based upon actual known performance or best estimates of actual performance during the performance period.\nRevenue is recognized when a client obtains control of promised products or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the entity expects to receive in exchange for those products or services. Determining when control has transferred can sometimes require management’s judgment (\ne.g.\n, implementation services), which could affect the timing of revenue recognition. Revenue is recognized exclusive of any applicable sales or other indirect taxes.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nRevenues are characterized by type, which broadly reflects the nature of how they are recognized or earned. Our revenue types are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. We also group our revenues by segment.\nRevenues By Type\nRecurring subscription revenues represent fees earned from clients primarily under renewable contracts or agreements and are generally paid annually or quarterly in advance and recognized in most cases ratably over the term of the license or service pursuant to the contract terms.  Revenues from subscription agreements for the receipt of periodic benchmark reports, digests and other publications, which are most often associated with our real estate offerings, are generally billed and recognized upon delivery of such reports or data updates.\nAsset-based fees are principally recognized based on the estimated AUM linked to our indexes from independent third-party sources or the most recently reported information provided by the client. Asset-based fees also include revenues related to futures and options contracts linked to our indexes, which are primarily based on trading volumes and fee levels. Asset-based fees are generally variable based upon AUM or the volume of trades or fee levels and are generally billed quarterly in arrears.\nNon-recurring revenues primarily represent fees earned on products and services where we do not have renewal clauses within the contract and revenues for providing customized reports, historical data sets, certain derivative financial products and certain implementation and consulting services. Based on the nature of the services provided, non-recurring revenues are generally billed upon delivery and recognized upon delivery or over the service period.\nRevenues By Segment\nIndex segment operating revenues consist of fees earned for licenses of index data subscriptions, performance obligations to deliver the data are satisfied over time and, accordingly, revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the agreement pursuant to the contract terms. With respect to licenses to create indexed investment products, such as ETFs, passively managed funds, or licenses which allow certain exchanges to use MSCI’s indexes as the basis for futures and options contracts, MSCI’s performance obligation allows customers to use the Company’s intellectual property (\ne.g.\n, the indexes) as the basis of the funds or other investment products the customers create over the term of the agreement. The fees earned for these rights are typically variable, in which case they are accrued under the sales and usage-based royalty exception pursuant to the level of performance achieved, which is measured based on AUM, volume of trades or other variable factors. The level of performance achieved is based on information obtained from independent third-party sources or best estimates taking into account the most recently reported information from the client.\nAnalytics segment operating revenues are recognized as MSCI satisfies performance obligations through providing access to its proprietary models or hosted applications and, in some cases, delivery of managed services, which are typically satisfied over time, and accordingly, operating revenues are recognized ratably over the term of the service period. For implementation services, MSCI meets its performance obligation once the implementation is\n70\ncomplete\nand the related\nservice\nis avai\nlable for the client to use\n.\nOperating r\nevenue\ns\nare\nrecognized at the point in time when the implementation service is completed.\nESG and Climate segment operating revenues are recognized as MSCI’s performance obligations to provide data to or update data for clients are satisfied. The majority of these performance obligations are satisfied over the term of the license period, with operating revenues recognized ratably. For custom ESG research data, the performance obligation is typically satisfied, and revenue is recognized, at the point in time when the data is updated and available to the client.\nAll Other – Private Assets segment operating revenues are recognized based on performance obligations satisfied over time and at a point in time.  Operating revenues for many Real Estate products including Market Information products and publications, subscriptions to Enterprise Analytics, Global Intel, and Income Analytics, Climate Value-at-Risk solutions and licenses to transaction and market insights data, are recognized over time as publications, analysis, insights and data are updated and made available to clients throughout the year.  Operating revenues for select Real Estate products, including benchmark reports, are recognized at the point in time when the Company satisfies the performance obligation through delivery to the client.\nShare-Based Compensation\nCertain of the Company’s employees have received share-based compensation under various compensation programs. The Company’s compensation expense reflects the fair value method of accounting for share-based payments under ASC Subtopic 718-10, “\nCompensation—Stock Compensation.\n” ASC Subtopic 718-10 requires measurement of compensation cost for equity-based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures per the Company’s policy.\nThe fair value of MSCI restricted stock units (“RSUs”) is measured using the price of MSCI’s common stock. Restricted stock units that are subject to the achievement of multi-year total shareholder return targets (“PSUs”) are performance awards with a market condition. The fair value of PSUs is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation model that creates a normal distribution of future stock prices, which is then used to value the awards based on their individual terms. From time to time, the Company awards restricted stock units subject to performance conditions that are not linked to a market condition but are based on performance measures that impact the amount of shares that each recipient will receive upon vesting. The fair value of such awards is measured using the price of MSCI’s common stock.\nResearch and Development\nThe Company accounts for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including ASC Subtopic 730-10, “\nResearch and Development\n.” ASC Subtopic 730-10 requires that research and development costs generally be expensed as incurred. The majority of the Company’s research and development costs are incurred in developing, reviewing and enhancing the methodologies and data models offered within its product portfolio by monitoring investment trends and drivers globally, as well as analyzing product-specific needs in areas such as capitalization-weighted, factor and specialized indexes, and instrument valuation, risk modeling, portfolio construction, asset allocation and value-at-risk simulation.\nInternal Use Software\nThe Company applies the provisions of ASC Subtopic 350-40, “\nInternal Use Software\n,” and accounts for the cost of computer software developed for internal use by capitalizing qualifying costs, which are substantially incurred during the application development stage. The amounts capitalized are included in Intangible Assets on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition and include external direct costs of services used in developing internal-use software and payroll and payroll-related costs of employees directly associated with the development activities. Additionally, costs incurred relating to upgrades and enhancements to the software are capitalized if it is determined that these upgrades or enhancements provide additional functionality to the software.\nCapitalized software development costs are typically amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the related product, which is typically\nthree\nto\nfive\nyears\n, beginning with the date the software is placed into service.\n71\nCosts incurred in the preliminary and post-implementation stages of MSCI’s products are expensed as incurred.\nIncome Taxes\nProvision for income taxes is provided for using the asset and liability method, under which deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are determined based on the temporary differences between the financial statement and income tax bases of assets and liabilities using currently enacted tax rates. The Company elects to account for Global Intangible Low-Taxed Income (“GILTI”) in the year the tax is incurred. The Company recognizes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nThe Company regularly evaluates the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it is required to file income tax returns. The Company has recorded additional tax expense related to open tax years, which the Company’s management believes is adequate in relation to the potential for assessments. These amounts have been recorded in “Other non-current liabilities” on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition. The Company’s management believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the Company’s consolidated financial condition. However, to the extent the Company is required to pay amounts in excess of its reserves, a resolution could have a material impact on its Consolidated Statement of Income for a particular future period. In addition, an unfavorable tax settlement could require use of cash and result in an increase in the effective tax rate in the period in which such resolution occurs.\nDeferred Revenue\nDeferred revenues represent both cash received and the amounts billed to clients for products and services in advance of satisfying performance obligations. Deferred revenue generally results in ratable recognition of operating revenues over the license or subscription period, as the performance obligations are satisfied.\nAccounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts\nThe Company’s clients generally pay subscription fees annually or quarterly in advance.  MSCI’s policy is to record to a receivable when a client is billed. For products and services that are provided in advance of billing, such as for our asset-based fee products, unbilled revenue (or a “contract asset”) is included in Accounts Receivable on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nThe Company recognizes an allowance for doubtful accounts at the time invoices are sent to clients by applying an estimate of the uncollectable amount based on client profiles, credit considerations and historical write-offs. The Company does not require collateral from clients to mitigate credit risk.\nChanges in the allowance for doubtful accounts from December 31, 2018 to December 31, 2021 were as follows:\n72\nGoodwill\nGoodwill is recorded as part of the Company’s acquisitions of businesses when the purchase price exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and separately identifiable intangible assets acquired. The Company’s goodwill is not amortized, but rather is subject to an impairment test each year, or more often if conditions indicate impairment may have occurred, pursuant to ASC Subtopic 350-10, “\nIntangibles—Goodwill and Other\n.”\nThe Company tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis on July 1\nst\nand on an interim basis when certain events and circumstances exist. The test for impairment is performed at the reporting unit level. Goodwill impairment is determined by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying value. If the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying value, goodwill at the reporting unit level is not deemed to be impaired. If the estimated fair value is below carrying value, an impairment charge will be recorded up to, but not more than, the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nThe Company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of July 1, 2021 on its Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and Real Estate reporting units, and\nno\nimpairments were noted. The Company performed a quantitative test for impairment and determined that the estimated fair value of the Company’s reporting units substantially exceeded their respective carrying values.\nBased on the results of the annual goodwill impairment testing performed and given there were no impairment triggers identified as part of interim assessments,\nno\nimpairment of goodwill was recorded during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nIntangible Assets\nThe Company amortizes definite-lived intangible assets over their estimated useful lives. Definite-lived intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable. The Company also reviews the useful lives on a quarterly basis to determine if the period of economic benefit has changed. If the carrying value of an intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge would\nbe recognized in an amount equal to the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its fair value.\nThere were no\nevents or changes in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of the definite-lived intangible assets may not be recoverable\nduring the years\nended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nThe Company had no indefinite-lived intangible assets.\nForeign Currency Translation\nAssets and liabilities of operations having non-U.S. dollar functional currencies are translated at year-end exchange rates, and income statement accounts are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the year. Gains or losses resulting from translating foreign currency financial statements, net of any related tax effects, are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive loss, a separate component of shareholders’ equity (deficit). Gains or losses resulting from foreign currency transactions incurred in currencies other than the local functional currency are included in non-operating “Other expense (income)” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nLeases\nMSCI leases office space, data centers and certain equipment under non-cancellable operating lease agreements and determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. The Company does not currently have any financing lease arrangements.\nRight of use assets represent the Company’s right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent the Company’s obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Right of use assets are recognized on the commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term adjusted for initial direct costs and lease incentives received or deemed probable of being received. MSCI uses its incremental borrowing rate based on the information available on the commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments. The lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise that option.\n73\nRight of use\nassets\nand associated\nleasehold improvements are tested for impairment when there is a trigger for impairment testing at the appropriate asset group level. When a trigger exists, the asset group is tested for recoverability by comparing the estimated undiscounted cash flows to the asset group’s carrying value.\nIf the asset group fails the recoverability test, the Company will measure impairment loss as the difference between the fair value and carrying value of the\nasset group\n.\nLease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and is included in “Operating expenses” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. In situations where a right of use asset has been impaired, the subsequent amortization of the right of use asset is then recorded on a straight-line basis over the remaining lease term and is combined with accretion expense on the lease liability to result in single operating lease cost.\nSome of the Company’s lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation which are accounted for as variable lease amounts but are not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. Certain leases also require the Company to pay real estate taxes, insurance, maintenance and other operating expenses associated with the leased premises or equipment which are also not reflected as a component of the Company’s lease liability. The Company also subleases a small portion of its leased office space to third parties and thereby applies sublessor accounting. Sublease income is presented in “Operating expenses” as an offset.\nProperty, Equipment and Leasehold Improvements\nProperty, equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation and amortization of furniture and fixtures, and computer and communications equipment are accounted for using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life, and for leasehold improvements, over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the lease term.\nTreasury Stock\nThe Company holds repurchased shares of common stock as treasury stock. The Company accounts for treasury stock under the cost method and includes treasury stock as a component of shareholders’ equity (deficit).\nAccrued Compensation\nA significant portion of the Company’s employee incentive compensation programs are discretionary. The Company makes significant estimates in determining its accrued compensation and benefits expenses. Accrued cash incentive estimates reflect an assessment of performance versus targets and other key performance indicators at the Company, operating segment and employee level. The Company also reviews compensation and benefits expenses throughout the year to determine how overall performance compares to management’s expectations. These and other factors, including historical performance, are taken into account in accruing discretionary cash compensation estimates quarterly.\nConcentrations\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, BlackRock, Inc. accounted for\n12.7\n%,\n11.0\n%, and\n11.5\n% of the Company’s consolidated operating revenues, respectively. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, BlackRock, Inc. accounted for\n20.4\n%,\n18.0\n% and\n18.9\n% of the Index segment’s operating revenues, respectively.\nNo\nsingle customer accounted for 10.0% or more of operating revenues within the Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other – Private Assets segments for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n2. RECENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES\nIn October 2021, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2021-08, “Business Combinations (Topic 805): Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers,” or ASU 2021-08, which requires contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination to be recognized in accordance with ASC Topic 606. The Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 as of the issuance date and is therefore required to retrospectively apply the standard to business combinations which occurred this fiscal year. The Company’s adoption of the standard resulted in recognition of an additional $\n7.0\nmillion in deferred revenue and a reduction in deferred tax liabilities of $\n1.8\nmillion as of September 13, 2021, associated with the acquisition of Real Capital Analytics, Inc. (“RCA”).\n74\n3. REVENUE RECOGNITION\nMSCI’s operating revenues are reported by product type, which generally reflects the timing of recognition. The Company’s operating revenues types are recurring subscriptions, asset-based fees and non-recurring revenues. The Company also disaggregates operating revenues by segment.\nThe tables that follow present the disaggregated operating revenues for the periods indicated:\nThe table that follows presents the change in accounts receivable and deferred revenue between the dates indicated:\n75\nThe amount of revenue recognized in the period that was included in the opening current deferred revenue, which reflects the contract liability amounts, was $\n672.5\nmillion, $\n555.8\nmillion and $\n522.7\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively. The difference between the opening and closing balances of the Company’s deferred revenue was primarily driven by an increase in billings, partially offset by an increase in amortization of deferred revenue to operating revenues. As of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company carried a long-term deferred revenue balance of $\n23.4\nmillion, $\n7.1\nmillion and $\n4.3\nmillion, respectively, in “Other non-current liabilities” on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition.\nFor contracts that have a duration of one year or less, the Company has not disclosed either the remaining performance obligation as of the end of the reporting period or when the Company expects to recognize the revenue.\nThe remaining performance obligations for contracts that have a duration of greater than one year and the periods in which they are expected to be recognized are as follows:\n4. EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE\nBasic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed by dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Common shares outstanding include common stock and vested restricted stock unit awards where recipients have satisfied the explicit vesting terms. Diluted EPS reflects the assumed conversion of all dilutive securities.\nThe following table presents the computation of basic and diluted EPS:\n5. ACQUISITIONS\nOn\nSeptember 13, 2021\n, MSCI acquired all of the issued and outstanding preferred and common shares of RCA for an aggregate cash purchase price of $\n949.0\nmillion. This acquisition expands MSCI’s suite of real estate solutions, providing the real estate industry with data, analytics, and support tools to manage investments and understand performance and risk, including climate risk, within their portfolios. RCA has been accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting and has been integrated into the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment, as a component of the Real Estate operating segment. A portion of RCA’s client\n76\nagreements do not have automatic renewal clauses at the end of the subscription period. Due to the historically high retention rate and expectation that a substantial portion of the client agreements will be renewed, the associated revenue is recorded as recurring subscription revenue.\nThe components of the preliminary purchase price allocation were as follows:\nThe purchase price allocation is based on preliminary valuations and assessments. The estimates and assumptions used may be subject to change within the measurement period, particularly for acquired intangible assets and deferred taxes. As discussed in Note 2, the Company early adopted ASU 2021-08 which resulted in an increase to deferred revenue and goodwill and a decrease in deferred tax liabilities recorded as of the opening balance sheet date.\nThe Company, with the assistance of third-party valuation experts, utilized the following methodologies to estimate the fair values of acquired intangible assets: the relief from royalty method, the replacement cost method and the multi-period excess earnings method. The significant assumptions used to estimate the fair value of the acquired intangible assets included, forecasted cash flows which were determined based on certain assumptions which included, among others, projected future revenues, and expected market royalty rate, technology obsolescence rates and discount rates.\nThe recorded goodwill is primarily attributable to the utilization of the acquired data as well as expanded market opportunities.

EMPLOYEE BENEFITS\nThe Company sponsors a 401(k) plan for eligible U.S. employees and defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans that cover substantially all of its non-U.S. employees. Eligible employees may participate in the MSCI 401(k) plan (or any other regional defined contribution plan sponsored by MSCI) immediately upon hire. Eligible employees receive 401(k) and other defined contribution plan matching contributions, which are subject to vesting and certain other limitations. Additionally, some non-US employees are eligible to participate in and receive contributions to defined benefit plans.\nThe following table reflects the employee benefits expense by cost, type and location in the Statement of Income for the periods indicated:\nThe Company uses a measurement date of December 31\nst\nto calculate obligations under its pension and postretirement plans.

The fair value of the defined benefit plan assets was $\n30.2\nmillion and $\n28.5\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Company’s retiree benefit plans include defined benefit plans for employees in Switzerland, as well as other countries where MSCI maintains an operating presence.\nOur Switzerland plans are government-mandated retirement funds that provide employees with a minimum investment return, which is determined annually by the Swiss government and was\n1.0\n% in the years ended December 31,\n2021\n, 2020 and 2019. Under the Switzerland plans, the Company and our employees are required to make contributions into a fund managed by an independent investment fiduciary. Employer contributions must be in an amount at least equal to the employee’s contribution. Employee contributions are based on the respective employee’s age, salary and chosen contribution scale. As of December 31,\n2021\nand 2020, the Switzerland plans had a gross pension liability of $\n34.0\nmillion and $\n34.8\nmillion, respectively, and plan assets that totaled $\n26.1\nmillion and $\n24.6\nmillion, respectively. In the years ended December 31,\n2021\n, 2020 and 2019, we recognized net periodic benefit expense of $\n0.3\nmillion, $\n0.5\nmillion and $\n1.0\nmillion, respectively, related to our Switzerland plans.\nThe discount rate for the Switzerland defined benefit pension plan was\n0.30\n% and\n0.10\n%, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n83\nThe investment strategies of the non-U.S. defined benefit plans vary according to the plan provisions and local laws.\nThe majority of\nthe assets in the non-U.S. plans are in the Switzerland plans. The Switzerland plans are associated with an insured collective retirement foundation, whereby assets are held in trust and the assets are comingled with those of other participating companies. Investment decisions are made by a board of the collective retirement foundation, comprised of participating company representatives and representatives from the insurer. The overall strategy is to manage risk while maximizing total returns.\n11. SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY (DEFICIT)\nThis note reflects the share repurchases and related activity as well as share-based compensation activity recognized by the Company, for all periods referenced.\nReturn of capital\nOn October 29, 2020, the Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to $\n1,000.0\nmillion worth of shares of MSCI’s common stock\nin addition to the\n$\n804.5\nmillion of authorization\nthen remaining under a previously existing share repurchase program\n(the “2020 Repurchase Program”)\nfor a total of $\n1,804.5\nmillion of stock repurchase authorization\n.\nShare repurchases made pursuant to the 2020 Repurchase Program may take place in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time based on market and other conditions. This authorization may be modified, suspended or terminated by the Board of Directors at any time without prior notice. As of December 31, 2021, there was $\n1,589.2\nmillion of available authorization remaining under the 2020 Repurchase Program.\nThe following table provides information with respect to repurchases of the Company’s common stock made on the open market:\n84\nThe following table presents dividends declared per common share as well as total amounts declared, distributed and deferred for the periods indicated\nCommon Stock\nThe following table presents activity related to shares of common stock issued and repurchased for the periods indicated:\nShare-Based Compensation\nThe Company regularly issues share-based compensation to its employees and directors who are not employees of the Company. The accounting guidance for share-based compensation requires measurement of\n85\ncompensation cost for share-based awards at fair value and recognition of compensation cost over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures.\nIn February 2022, the Company granted a portion of its employees awards in the form of RSUs, PSUs and performance stock options (“PSOs”). The total number of units and options granted was\n227,684\n. The aggregate fair value of the awards was $\n79.6\nmillion. The RSUs granted in 2022 vest at the end of a\nthree-year\nservice period. The PSUs granted in 2022 vest at the end of a\nthree-year\nservice period, are subject to a\none-year\nsale restriction and are also subject to the achievement of an absolute total shareholder return compounded annual growth rate, measured over a\nthree-year\nperiod. The PSOs granted in 2022 vest and become exercisable at the end of a\nthree-year\nservice period and are subject to a performance condition based on the combined level of achievement of a cumulative revenue performance goal and a cumulative adjusted EPS performance goal, measured over a three-year period. All of these awards are subject to forfeiture under specific criteria set in the award agreements.\nIn connection with awards under its equity-based compensation and benefit plans, the Company is authorized to use newly-issued shares or certain shares of common stock held in treasury.\nThe following table presents the amount of share-based compensation expense by category for the periods indicated:\nThe windfall tax benefits for share-based compensation expense related to RSUs, PSUs and other restricted stock unit awards (together, the “Share-based Awards”) as well as stock options granted to Company employees and to directors who are not employees of the Company were $\n22.3\nmillion, $\n20.9\nmillion and $\n82.5\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, $\n52.3\nmillion of compensation cost related to MSCI unvested share-based awards granted to the Company’s employees and to directors who are not employees of the Company had not yet been recognized. The unrecognized compensation cost relating to unvested stock-based awards expected to vest will be recognized primarily over the next\none\nto\nfive\nyears\n.\nIn connection with awards under its equity-based compensation and benefit plans, the Company is authorized to issue shares of common stock. As of December 31, 2021,\n3.8\nmillion shares of common stock were available for future grants under these plans.\nCertain Company employees have been granted Share-based Awards pursuant to a share-based compensation plan. The plan provides for the deferral of a portion of certain employees’ discretionary compensation with awards made in the form of Share-based Awards. Recipients of Share-based Awards generally have rights to receive dividend equivalents that are subject to vesting. The Company reports the target number of PSUs granted unless it has determined, based on the actual achievement of performance measures, that an employee will receive a different amount of shares underlying the PSUs, in which case the Company reports the amount of shares employees are likely to receive.\n86\nThe fair value of the PSUs on the award dates were estimated under the Monte Carlo method using the following assumptions:\nThe risk-free interest rate was determined based on the yields available on U.S. Constant Maturity Treasury yield curve as of the valuation dates with a maturity commensurate with the terms.  The expected stock price volatility was determined using historical volatility. Since the PSU awards are dividend-protected, the assumed dividend yield applied in the valuation was\n0.0\n%.\nThe following table presents activity concerning the Company’s vested and unvested Share-based Awards applicable to its employees (share data in thousands) for the period indicated:\nThe total fair value of Share-based Awards held by the Company’s employees that converted to MSCI common stock during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n152.6\nmillion, $\n133.6\nmillion and $\n401.7\nmillion, respectively.\nThe following table presents activity concerning the Company’s unvested Share-based Awards related to its employees (share data in thousands):\nThere were\nno\nremaining stock options outstanding that could be exercised during any of the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020. The intrinsic value of the stock options exercised by the Company’s employees during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $\n22.1\nmillion.\n87\n12. INCOME TAXES\nThe provision for income taxes (benefits) by taxing jurisdiction consisted of:\nThe following table reconciles the U.S. federal statutory income tax rate to the effective income tax rate:\n88\nDeferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when such differences are expected to reverse.\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:\nAs presented in the table above, the Company has certain loss and interest carryforward items. The tax value of the U.S. portion of the interest carryforward was\nzero\nand $\n0.7\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The tax value of the non-U.S. portion of the interest carryforward was $\n11.2\nmillion and $\n7.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively.  These carryforwards are subject to annual limitations on utilization over an indefinite life.\nNet operating loss carryforwards in the U.S. were $\n69.7\nmillion with a tax value of $\n17.9\nmillion and $\n8.7\nmillion with a tax value of $\n1.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. The increase in the net operating loss carryforward in the U.S. is primarily attributable to the September 13, 2021 acquisition of RCA. These carryforwards are subject to annual limitations and will begin to expire in\n2026\n. The tax value of the non-U.S. portion of the net operating loss was $\n0.3\nmillion and $\n1.2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 respectively. These carryforwards are subject to annual limitations and will begin to expire in\n2023\n.\nThe Company believes the majority of the deferred tax assets at December 31, 2021 are more likely than not to be realized based on expectations as to future taxable income in the jurisdictions in which it operates with the exception of a loss carryforward in one jurisdiction where it has established a valuation allowance of $\n0.04\nmillion.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has recorded prepayments of taxes in the amount of $\n36.5\nmillion in “Other non-current assets” on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Condition, as the amounts are not anticipated to be received until after December 31, 2022.\n89\nThe following table presents changes\nin the Company’s deferred tax asset valuation allowance for the periods indicated:\nThe following table presents the components of income before provision for income taxes generated by domestic or foreign operations for the periods indicated:\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has provided for applicable state income and foreign withholding taxes on all undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.\nThe Company regularly assesses the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the taxing jurisdictions in which it files income tax returns. The Company has established unrecognized tax benefits that the Company believes are adequate in relation to the potential for additional assessments. Once established, the Company adjusts unrecognized tax benefits only when more information is available or when an event occurs necessitating a change. Based on the current status of income tax audits, the Company believes it is reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized benefits may decrease by approximately $\n31.6\nmillion in the next twelve months as a result of the resolution of tax examinations.\nThe Company believes the resolution of tax matters will not have a material effect on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition of the Company, although a resolution could have a material impact on the Company’s Consolidated Statement of Income for a particular future period and on the Company’s effective tax rate for any period in which such resolution occurs.\n90\nThe following table presents a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of the gross unrecognized tax benefits, excluding interest and penalties, for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nThe total amount of unrecognized tax benefits was $\n33.0\nmillion, $\n16.6\nmillion and $\n15.8\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which, if recognized, would favorably affect the effective tax rate in future periods. The increase in unrecognized tax benefits in the year ended December 31, 2021 is principally due to the filing of prior year refund claims. The Company recognizes the accrual of interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in the “Provision for income taxes” in the Consolidated Statement of Income. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company recognized\nzero\nand for the year ended December 31, 2019, the Company recognized $\n0.4\nmillion of interest in the Consolidated Statement of Income with respect to unrecognized tax benefits. Penalties of $\n0.3\nmillion, $\n0.4\nmillion and\nzero\nwere recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income and the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The amount of accrued interest, which includes interest related to uncertain tax positions and accrued income tax expense, recorded on the Consolidated Statement of Financial Condition as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n0.9\nmillion.\nThe Company is under examination by tax authorities in certain jurisdictions, including foreign jurisdictions, such as the United Kingdom, Switzerland and India, and states in the U.S. in which the Company has significant operations, such as New York and California. The tax years currently under examination vary by jurisdiction but include years ranging from\n2008\nthrough\n2020\n.\n13. SEGMENT INFORMATION\nASC Subtopic 280-10,\n“Segment Reporting,”\nestablishes standards for reporting information about operating segments. Operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker, or CODM, in deciding how to allocate resources and assess performance. MSCI’s Chief Executive Officer and its President and Chief Operating Officer, who are together considered to be its CODM, review financial information presented on an operating segment basis for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing financial performance.\nThe CODM measures and evaluates reportable segments based on segment operating revenues as well as Adjusted EBITDA and other measures. The Company excludes the following items from segment Adjusted EBITDA: provision for income taxes, other expense (income), net, depreciation and amortization of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, amortization of intangible assets and, at times, certain other transactions or adjustments, including impairment related to sublease of leased property, certain non-recurring acquisition-related integration and transaction costs and the impact related to the vesting of multi-year restricted stock units granted in 2016 to certain senior executives that are subject to the achievement of multi-year total shareholder return targets, which are performance targets with a market condition (the “2016 Multi-Year PSUs”), that the CODM does not consider for the purposes of making decisions to allocate resources among segments or to assess segment performance. Although these amounts are excluded from segment Adjusted EBITDA, they are included in reported consolidated net income and are included in the reconciliation that follows.\n91\nThe Company’s computation of segment Adjusted EBITDA may not be comparable to other\nsimilarly-titled\nmeasures computed by other companies because all companies do not calculate segment Adjusted EBITDA in the same fashion.\nOperating revenues and expenses directly associated with each segment are included in determining its operating results. Other expenses that are not directly attributable to a particular segment are based upon allocation methodologies, including time estimates, revenue, headcount, sales targets, data center consumption and other relevant usage measures. Due to the integrated structure of MSCI’s business, certain costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. A segment may use the content and data produced by another segment without incurring an arm’s-length intersegment charge.\nThe CODM does not review any information regarding total assets on an operating segment basis. Operating segments do not record intersegment revenues, and, accordingly, there is none to be reported. The accounting policies for segment reporting are the same as for MSCI as a whole.\nThe Company has\nfive\noperating segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate, Real Estate and Burgiss, which are presented as the following four reportable segments: Index, Analytics, ESG and Climate and All Other – Private Assets.\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company began presenting\nfour\nreportable segments with the ESG and Climate operating segment being presented as a separate reportable segment. The operating segments of Real Estate and Burgiss do not individually meet the segment reporting thresholds and have been combined and presented as part of All Other – Private Assets reportable segment. The Company’s ownership interest in Burgiss is classified as an equity-method investment. Therefore, the All Other – Private Assets segment does not include the Company’s proportionate share of operating revenues and Adjusted EBITDA related to Burgiss. The Company’s proportionate share of the income or loss from its equity-method investment in Burgiss is not a component of Adjusted EBITDA as it is reported as a component of other (expense) income, net. Prior period amounts have been recast to reflect the current presentation.\nThe Index operating segment offers equity and fixed income indexes. The indexes are used in many areas of the investment process, including indexed product creation (e.g.,\nETFs, mutual funds, annuities, futures, options, structured products, over-the-counter derivatives\n), performance benchmarking, portfolio construction and rebalancing, and asset allocation.\nThe Analytics operating segment offers risk management, performance attribution and portfolio management content, applications and services that provide clients with an integrated view of risk and return and tools for analyzing market, credit, liquidity, counterparty and climate risk across all major asset classes, spanning short-, medium- and long-term time horizons. Clients access Analytics tools and content through MSCI’s proprietary applications and application programming interfaces, third-party applications or directly through their own platforms. Additionally, the Analytics operating segment also provides various managed services to help clients operate more efficiently, including consolidation of client portfolio data from various sources, review and reconciliation of input data and results, and customized reporting.\nThe ESG and Climate operating segment offers products and services that help institutional investors understand how ESG and climate considerations can impact the long-term risk and return of their portfolio and individual security-level investments. In addition, the\nESG and Climate operating segment provides data, ratings, research and tools to help investors navigate increasing regulation, meet new client demands and better integrate ESG and climate elements into their investment processes\n.\nThe Real Estate operating segment offers real estate market and transaction data, benchmarks, return-analytics, climate assessments and market insights for funds, investors, managers and other real estate market participants. In addition, Real Estate performance and risk analytics range from enterprise-wide to property-specific analysis. The Real Estate operating segment also provides business intelligence products to real estate owners, managers, developers and brokers worldwide. Financial results related to the acquisition of RCA have been included prospectively as a component of the Real Estate operating segment, presented as a component of the All Other – Private Assets reportable segment, as of September 13, 2021.\nThe Burgiss operating segment represents the Company’s equity method investment in Burgiss, a global provider of investment decision support tools for private capital.\n92\nThe change in reportable segments has not resulted in any changes to MSCI’s Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) or the basis for segment profitability. The CODM continues to measure and evaluate reportable segments based on segment operating revenues as well as Adjusted EBITDA and other measures.\nThe following table presents operating revenues by reportable segment for the periods indicated:\nThe following table presents segment profitability and a reconciliation to net income for the periods indicated:\n93\nOperating revenues by geography are based on the shipping address of the ultimate customer utilizing the product. The following table presents revenue by geographic area for the periods indicated:\nLong-lived assets consist of property, equipment and leasehold improvements, right of use assets and internally developed capitalized software, net of accumulated depreciation and amortization. The following table presents long-lived assets by geographic area on the dates indicated:\n94\n14. QUARTERLY RESULTS OF OPERATIONS (unaudited):\n15. SUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nSubsequent to the year ended December 31, 2021 and through trade date of February 10, 2022, the Company repurchased an additional\n1.2\nmillion shares of common stock at an average price of $\n515.83\nper share for a total value of $\n634.1\nmillion.\nOn\nJanuary 24, 2022\n, the Board of Directors of the Company declared a quarterly dividend of $\n1.04\nper share of common stock to be paid on\nFebruary 28, 2022\nto shareholders of record as of the close of trading on\nFebruary 18, 2022\n.\n95"

Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company maintains disclosure controls and procedures that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the Company’s reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”), is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to management, including our Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”) as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nManagement of the Company, with the participation of its CEO and CFO, evaluated the effectiveness of the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based on their evaluation, as of December 31, 2021, the end of the period covered by this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s CEO and CFO have concluded that the Company’s disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in Rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the Exchange Act) were effective.\n(b). Management’s Annual Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nOur management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) promulgated under the Exchange Act as a process designed by, or under the supervision of, our principal executive and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the Company’s Board of Directors, management and other personnel, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP and includes those policies and procedures that:\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021 based on the criteria described in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).\nBased on this assessment, management, including the Company’s CEO and CFO, concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, our internal control over financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Management excluded Real Capital Analytics, Inc. (“RCA”), acquired on September 13, 2021, from its evaluation of internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, total assets of RCA, excluding acquisition method fair value adjustments, represented 0.9% of our consolidated total assets. RCA represented 1.1% of our consolidated operating revenues for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, has audited and issued a report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, which appears on page 63 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\n96\n(c). Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) under the Exchange Act) during the fiscal quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting."

The Directors Plan replaced the Company’s then existing non-employee director compensation plan, the MSCI Inc. Independent Directors’ Equity Compensation Plan (the “2011 Plan”). The total number of shares authorized to be awarded under the Directors Plan is 352,460, which is equal to the number of shares that remained available for issuance under the 2011 Plan. Under the MSCI Inc. Non-Employee Directors Deferral Plan, directors may elect to defer receipt of all or any portion of any shares of our common stock issuable upon conversion of any stock unit or any retainer elected to be paid in shares of our common stock until (i) 60 days following separation of service or (ii) the earlier of a specified date or 60 days following separation of service.\nOn February 18, 2016, the Board of Directors, upon the recommendation of the Compensation Committee, approved the MSCI Inc. 2016 Omnibus Plan (“Omnibus Plan”), an equity incentive compensation plan that was approved by shareholders at the Company’s 2016 annual meeting of shareholders. The Omnibus Plan replaced the Company’s then existing equity compensation plan, the MSCI Inc. Amended and Restated 2007 Equity Incentive Compensation Plan (as amended, the “2007 Plan”). Compensation paid to the Company’s executive officers historically complied with the performance-based compensation exception under 162(m) of the IRC (“162(m)”) by being granted pursuant to the MSCI Inc. Performance Formula and Incentive Plan (the “Performance Plan”). Shareholder approval of the Omnibus Plan constituted approval of the material terms of the performance goals under the Omnibus Plan for purposes of 162(m). In light of the final Section 162(m) regulations published in December 2020, which, among other things, eliminated the performance-based compensation exception under Section 162(m), the Compensation Committee determined to cease awarding compensation to the Company’s executive officers under the Performance Plan starting with calendar year 2021.\n98\nPursuant to the Omnibus Plan, the Company reserved 7,565,483 shares of common stock for issuance;\nplus\nany additional shares which become available due to forfeiture, expiration or cancellation of outstanding awards, which were registered under the Securities Act following approval by the Company’s shareholders. This is in addition to currently outstanding awards under the 2007 Plan. The Omnibus Plan permits the Compensation Committee to make grants of a variety of equity-based awards (such as stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock units, restricted stock, performance awards and other stock-based awards) totaling up to 7,565,483 and other cash-based awards to eligible recipients, including employees and consultants. No awards will be granted under the Omnibus Plan after the earliest to occur of (\ni\n) April 28, 2026, (ii) the maximum number of shares available for issuance having been issued and (iii) the Board of Directors terminating the Omnibus Plan in accordance with its terms.\nThe following table presents certain information with respect to our equity compensation plans at December 31, 2021:"
