    "text": "Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (\"the Company\") was founded in 1843 by Frederick T. Stanley and incorporated in Connecticut in 1852. In March 2010, the Company completed a merger (\"the Merger\") with The Black & Decker Corporation (“Black & Decker”), a company founded by S. Duncan Black and Alonzo G. Decker and incorporated in Maryland in 1910. At that time, the Company changed its name from The Stanley Works to Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. The Company’s principal executive office is located at 1000 Stanley Drive, New Britain, Connecticut 06053 and its telephone number is (860) 225-5111.\nThe Company is a diversified global provider of hand tools, power tools, outdoor products and related accessories, engineered fastening systems and products, services and equipment for oil & gas and infrastructure applications, and automatic doors, with 2021 consolidated annual revenues of $15.6 billion. Approximately 60% of the Company’s 2021 revenues were generated in the United States, with the remainder largely from Europe (17%), emerging markets (14%) and Canada (5%).\nThe Company continues to execute a growth and acquisition strategy that involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth. The Company remains focused on delivering above-market organic growth with margin expansion by leveraging its proven and long-standing Stanley Black & Decker Operating Model (“SBD Operating Model”) which has continually evolved over the past 15 years as times have changed. At the center of the SBD Operating Model is the concept of the interrelationship between people and technology, which intersect and interact with the other key elements: Performance Resiliency, Extreme Innovation, Operations Excellence and Extraordinary Customer Experience. Each of these elements co-exists synergistically with the others in a systems-based approach. The Company will leverage the SBD Operating Model to continue making strides towards achieving its vision of delivering top-quartile financial performance, becoming known as one of the world’s leading innovators and elevating its commitment to social responsibility.\nThe above strategy has also resulted in approximately $13.5 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (excluding the Merger), which was enabled by strong cash flow generation and increased debt capacity. In recent years, the Company completed the acquisitions of the remaining 80 percent ownership stake of MTD Holdings Inc. (\"MTD\") for approximately $1.5 billion, Excel Industries (\"Excel\") for approximately $374 million, Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing, LLC (\"CAM\") for approximately $1.4 billion, and International Equipment Solutions Attachments Group (\"IES Attachments\") for approximately $654 million. The MTD acquisition expands the Company's presence in the $25 billion and growing outdoor category, with strong brands and growth opportunities. Excel is a strategically important bolt-on acquisition that bolsters the presence in the independent dealer network. The CAM acquisition further diversified the Company's presence in the industrial markets and expanded its portfolio of specialty fasteners in the aerospace and defense markets. The IES Attachments acquisition further diversified the Company's presence in the industrial markets, expanded its portfolio of attachment solutions and provided a meaningful platform for continued growth.\nFurthermore, in December 2021, the Company announced that it had reached a definitive agreement for the sale of most of its Security assets to Securitas AB for $3.2 billion in cash. The proposed transaction includes the Company's Convergent Security Solutions (\"CSS\") business comprising of commercial electronic security and healthcare businesses. The transaction does not include the Company's automatic doors business. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first half of 2022. Net proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to fund, in part, an approximately $4 billion share repurchase which is planned to be completed in 2022. The use of net proceeds towards a planned share repurchase program is consistent with the Company's long-term capital allocation strategy focused on value maximization.\nIn May 2019, the Company sold its Sargent and Greenleaf mechanical locks business for net proceeds of $79 million. The Company has also divested several smaller businesses in recent years that did not fit into its long-term strategic objectives. These divestitures allowed the Company to invest in other areas of the Company that fit into its long-term growth strategy.\nRefer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments,\nand\nNote T, Divestitures\n, of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin\nItem 8\nfor further discussion.\nThe Company’s growth and acquisition strategy is interdependent with its social responsibility strategy focused on workforce upskilling, product innovation, and environmental preservation including mitigating the impacts of climate change. These are core business issues that ensure the long-term viability of the Company, its customers, suppliers, and communities. The Company has established environmental, social and corporate governance (\"ESG\") targets embodied in its 2030 ESG strategy that include empowering 10 million makers and creators, enhancing 500 million lives through purpose-driven product\n3\ninnovation, becoming carbon-neutral, landfill-free across its operations, and reducing water use in water stressed and scarce areas. The carbon neutrality target includes third-party approved science-based targets to reduce absolute scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions by greater than 100% by 2030, and to reduce supply chain emissions by 35%. The Company’s ESG strategy considers all life-cycle stages including material procurement from supply chain partners, product design, manufacturing, distribution and transportation, product use, product service and end-of-life. Refer to section \"Human Capital Management\" for additional information regarding the Company's commitment to upskilling its employees and improving diversity, equity and inclusion.\nDescription of the Business\nThe Company’s operations are classified into two reportable business segments: Tools & Storage and Industrial. The Company has one non-reportable business operating segment, Mechanical Access Solutions (\"MAS\"). All reportable segments have significant international operations and are exposed to translational and transactional impacts from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.\nAdditional information regarding the Company’s business segments and geographic areas is incorporated herein by reference to the material captioned “\nBusiness Segment Results\n” in\nItem 7\nand\nNote P, Business Segments and Geographic Areas\n, of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin\nItem 8\n.\nTools & Storage\nThe Tools & Storage segment is comprised of the Power Tools Group (\"PTG\"), Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage (\"HTAS\"), and Outdoor Power Equipment (\"Outdoor\") businesses. Annual revenues in the Tools & Storage segment were $12.8 billion in 2021, representing 82% of the Company’s total revenues.\nThe PTG business includes both professional and consumer products.

The majority of sales are distributed through retailers, including home centers, mass merchants, hardware stores, and retail lumber yards, as well as third-party distributors, independent dealers, and a direct sales force.\nIndustrial\nThe Industrial segment is comprised of the Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure businesses. Annual revenues in the Industrial segment were $2.5 billion in 2021, representing 16% of the Company’s total revenues.\nThe Engineered Fastening business primarily sells highly engineered components such as fasteners, fittings and various engineered products, which are designed for specific application across multiple verticals. The product lines include externally threaded fasteners, blind rivets and tools, blind inserts and tools, drawn arc weld studs and systems, engineered plastic and mechanical fasteners, self-piercing riveting systems, precision nut running systems, micro fasteners, high-strength structural fasteners, axel swage, latches, heat shields, pins, and couplings. The business sells to customers in the automotive, manufacturing, electronics, construction, and aerospace industries, amongst others, and its products are distributed through direct sales forces and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors.\nThe Infrastructure business consists of the Attachment Tools and Oil & Gas product lines. Attachment Tools sells hydraulic tools and high quality, performance-driven heavy equipment attachment tools for off-highway applications. Oil & Gas sells and\n4\nrents custom pipe handling, joint welding and coating equipment used in the construction of large and small diameter pipelines, and provides pipeline inspection services. The Infrastructure business sells to the oil and natural gas pipeline industry and other industrial customers. The products and services are primarily distributed through a direct sales force and, to a lesser extent, third-party distributors.\nMechanical Access Solutions\nAnnual revenues for the MAS segment were $0.3 billion in 2021, representing 2% of the Company’s total revenues. The MAS business primarily sells automatic doors to commercial customers. Products are sold predominantly on a direct sales basis.\nOther Information\nCompetition\nThe Company competes on the basis of its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands, its commitment to customer service, its strong customer relationships, the breadth of its product lines, its innovative products and customer value propositions.\nThe Company encounters active competition in the Tools & Storage and Industrial segments from both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services. Certain large customers offer private label brands (“house brands”) that compete across a wide spectrum of the Company’s Tools & Storage segment product offerings.\nMajor Customers\nA significant portion of the Company’s Tools & Storage products are sold to home centers and mass merchants in the U.S. and Europe. A consolidation of retailers both in North America and abroad has occurred over time. While this consolidation and the domestic and international expansion of these large retailers have provided the Company with opportunities for growth, the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates a certain degree of exposure to potential sales volume loss. Lowe's accounted for approximately 15%, 17% and 17% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while The Home Depot accounted for approximately 15%, 14% and 12% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No other customer exceeded 10% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nWorking Capital\nThe Company continues to practice the five operating principles encompassed by Operations Excellence, one element of the SBD Operating Model, which work in concert: sales and operations planning, operational lean, complexity reduction, global supply management, order-to-cash excellence, the application of Industry 4.0 and upskilling the Company's workforce.  The Company develops standardized business processes and system platforms to reduce costs and provide scalability. Working capital turns were 5.1 at the end of 2021, down 6.0 turns from 2020, due to inventory investments to support the sustained strong demand outlook and longer lead times related to the challenged global supply chain which has substantially increased inventory in transit. The Company plans to continue leveraging Operations Excellence to generate ongoing improvements, both in the existing business and future acquisitions, in working capital turns, cycle times, complexity reduction and customer service levels, with a long-term goal of delivering 10+ working capital turns.\nRaw Materials\nThe Company’s products are manufactured using resins, ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum and nickel. The Company also purchases components such as batteries, motors, engines, transmissions, and electronic components to use in manufacturing and assembly operations along with resin-based molded parts. The raw materials required are procured globally and generally available from multiple sources at competitive prices. As part of the Company's Enterprise Risk Management, the Company has implemented a supplier risk mitigation strategy in order to identify and address any potential supply disruption or material scarcity issues associated with commodities, components, finished goods and critical services. Similar to other industries, the Company is experiencing supply chain constraints in semiconductors that is limiting its ability to fully serve its customer demand, however the Company has taken steps in 2021 to add supply and the Company's supply chain outlook for these electronic components continues to improve. The Company does not anticipate difficulties in obtaining supplies for any raw materials or energy used in its production processes.\nPatents and Trademarks\nNo business segment is solely dependent, to any significant degree, on patents, licenses, franchises or concessions, and the loss of one or several of these patents, licenses, franchises or concessions would not have a material adverse effect on any of the Company's businesses. The Company owns numerous patents, none of which individually is material to the Company's\n5\noperations as a whole. These patents expire at various times over the next 20 years. The Company holds licenses, franchises and concessions, none of which individually or in the aggregate are material to the Company's operations as a whole. These licenses, franchises and concessions vary in duration, but generally run from one to 40 years.\nThe Company has numerous trademarks that are used in its businesses worldwide. In the Tools & Storage segment, significant trademarks include STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER®, DEWALT®, FLEXVOLT®, IRWIN®, LENOX®, CRAFTSMAN®, PORTER-CABLE®, BOSTITCH®, FATMAX®, Powers®, Guaranteed Tough®, MAC TOOLS®, PROTO®, Vidmar®, FACOM®, Expert®, LISTA®, MTD®, CUB CADET®, TROY-BILT®, HUSTLER®, and the yellow & black color scheme for power tools and accessories. Significant trademarks in the Industrial segment include STANLEY®, CRC®, NELSON®, LaBounty®, Dubuis®, CribMaster®, POP®, Avdel®, Heli-Coil®, Tucker®, NPR®, Spiralock®, PALADIN®, CAM®, Bristol Industries®, Voss™, Aerofit™, EA Patten™, Integra®, Optia®, PENGO® and STANLEY® Assembly Technologies. The MAS segment includes significant trademarks such as STANLEY® and Stanley Access Technologies™. The terms of these trademarks typically vary from 10 to 20 years, with most trademarks being renewable indefinitely for like terms.\nGovernmental Regulations\nThe Company's operations are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations, both within and outside the U.S., in areas such as environmental protection, international trade, data privacy, tax, consumer protection, government contracts, climate change and others. The Company is subject to import and export controls, tariffs, and other trade-related regulations and restrictions in the countries in which it has operations or otherwise does business. These controls, tariffs, regulations, and restrictions have had, and may continue to have, a material impact on the Company's business, including its ability to sell products and to manufacture or source components. Refer to\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nin\nPart I\nof this Form 10-K for additional information regarding various laws and regulations that affect the Company's business operations.\nThe Company is also subject to various environmental laws and regulations in the U.S. and foreign countries where it has operations. In the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to environmental issues. The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. In the event that no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had reserves of $159.1 million and $174.2 million, respectively, for remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2021 amount, $46.1 million is classified as current and $113.0 million as long-term, which is expected to be paid over the estimated remediation period. As of January 1, 2022, the Company has recorded $16.1 million in other assets related to funding by the Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and monies received have been placed in trust in accordance with the Consent Decree associated with the West Coast Loading Corporation (\"WCLC\") proceedings, as further discussed in\nNote S, Contingencies\n, of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin\nItem 8\n. Accordingly, the Company's net cash obligation as of January 1, 2022 associated with the aforementioned remediation activities is $143.0 million. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $93.7 million to $229.3 million, which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with the Company's policy.\nThe amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on estimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity. Additional information regarding environmental matters is available in\nNote S, Contingencies\n, of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin\nItem 8\n.\nCompliance with government regulations, including environmental and climate change regulations, has not had, and based on current information and the applicable laws and regulations currently in effect, is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's capital expenditures, results of operations or competitive position. However, laws and regulations may be changed, accelerated or adopted that impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon the Company and which could negatively impact its operating results and financial condition.\n6\nHuman Capital Management\nAt Stanley Black & Decker, human capital management proliferates what the Company considers to be its Purpose (why the organization exists), Values (intrinsically important priorities), Leadership Principles (how the senior leadership thinks about problems and people), and Operating Model (the long-term plan of action and priorities). The Company is aware that the world in which it operates necessitates acceleration of how it prioritizes human capital and the enhanced focus on empathic leadership, health and well-being and the growing needs of a globally diverse workforce.\nThe Company believes its strategic focus on its people, culture and employer brand differentiates it in this dynamic, competitive landscape. Tenets of its strategic focus include employee experience powered by the intersection of people and technology, hybrid working models, understanding how to maximize talent by leveraging people analytics, and driving leadership behaviors such as agility, inclusion, flexibility, among others in its management teams. The Company continues to focus and invest in talent and people experiences, which it believes is critical to its continued success as a 179-year-old organization.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company had approximately 71,300 employees, inclusive of recently acquired businesses and approximately 8,000 employees included in the aforementioned pending sale of the CSS business, in over 60 countries. Approximately 37% of total employees were employed in the U.S. In addition, the Company had approximately 10,400 temporary contractors globally, primarily in operations. The workforce is comprised of approximately 69% hourly-paid employees, principally in manufacturing, distribution centers and security monitoring operations, and 31% salaried employees.  There were approximately 1,500 U.S. employees covered by collective bargaining agreements dispersed among 28 different local labor unions, and a majority of European employees are represented by Works Councils. Six U.S. collective bargaining agreements are scheduled for renegotiation in the next 12 months. The Company strives to maintain a positive relationship with all its employees, as well as the unions and works councils representing them, where applicable.\nTalent Attraction, Development, and Retention\nAttraction\nIn 2021, the Company invested in its employer of choice branding and specialty recruiting. Examples of branding investments include launching a program for new hires to notify their social media networks upon joining the Company, new app-based technology that allows colleagues to share curated news about the Company externally, and a refresh of the Company’s public website. Examples of recruiting investments include dedicated resources to source diverse talent, a new recruiting client resource management platform, and organizing internal recruiting teams to better focus on highly technical roles with skills shortages such as data scientists, software engineers, and battery engineers.\nThe Company also has an emphasis on university recruiting at historically black colleges and universities and professional associations such as the Society of Hispanic Professional Engineers to expand its reach to identify diverse candidates. Approximately 37% of global new hires in 2021 were female, inclusive of recently acquired businesses, versus 35% in 2020, and in the U.S. approximately 45% of new employees were racially or ethnically diverse, inclusive of recently acquired businesses, versus 47% in 2020.\nDevelopment\nTalent development is a key enabler of the SBD Operating Model where people and technology sit at the center. Performance feedback is designed to happen in real time throughout the year. Lifelong learning is supported internally through the Stanley Black & Decker University and externally with third-party partners. The Company offers over 30,000 training courses to its colleagues, and employees attended more than 25,000 hours of online voluntary learning in 2021. Additionally, the Company focuses on leadership development anchored around its Leader Principles, Values and newly introduced leader habits and behaviors that highlight the importance of attributes like empathy, inclusivity and listening. The Company invested in AI-based video technology to help its operations employees learn outside of the classroom and to increase uptake. In 2021, the Company invested in development and talent initiatives for its operations workforce through a dedicated operations-focused Workforce Readiness organization. With a focus on critical skills, up-skilling initiatives, and future career opportunities across its operations workforce, the Company is educating and developing the workforce together with advancements in manufacturing capabilities.\nRetention\nThe Company monitors organizational health through a variety of channels including employee opinion surveys, townhalls, roundtables, listening sessions, and an internal communications and social collaboration platform called Workplace. The\n7\nCompany’s People Analytics team has built an interactive cloud-based organizational portal that provides leaders with over 30 metrics related to headcount, hiring, and retention to enhance insight from people data and add new dimensions of forward looking, predictive capability.\nCompensation\nCompensation and benefits are globally managed and tailored by country to maintain market competitiveness, and effectively attract, retain, and reward employees. The Company’s portfolio of programs is designed in the context of its compensation philosophy underpinned by the tenets of competitive pay, pay for performance, alignment with shareholder interests, and the Company's intent to provide fair and equitable pay supporting an inclusive culture. In addition to standard compensation and benefits packages, a sizable portion of managers and select individual contributors receive annual incentives contingent on achievement of business objectives, and all employees are generally eligible for special recognition awards.\nDiversity, Equity & Inclusion\nThe Company is committed to building and nurturing an inclusive culture of passion and belonging where employees feel valued, heard, and are positioned to succeed. As of January 1, 2022, the Company's Board of Directors (the “Board”) is comprised of 36% female and 9% racially or ethnically diverse directors. The Chief Executive Officer (“CEO”) and his direct staff are comprised of 36% female leaders versus 27% in 2020, and 36% racially or ethnically diverse leaders versus 20% in 2020. Females represent approximately 33% of the global workforce versus 31% in 2020. In the U.S., approximately 34% of employees are racially or ethnically diverse versus 33% in 2020. A copy of the Company's most recently filed Equal Employment Opportunity report to the U.S. government (EEO-1) can be found on the Company’s website.\nIn early 2021, the Chief Diversity Officer (“CDO”) position was created and added to the CEO’s direct reports. The CDO, with the support of a dedicated team of diversity, equity, and inclusion (“DEI”) professionals, intends to promote a broad approach to DEI with the goal of accelerating Company performance, optimizing organizational culture, enhancing transparency, and strengthening accountability. The Company is continuing to execute initiatives across the global workforce designed to foster an inclusive workplace and facilitate equitable career development opportunities. The Company provides training and guidance to employees regarding diversity, including inclusive workforce training and DEI training for new hires. An internal knowledge library of DEI resources is available on the Company intranet. Management monitors hiring, retention, promotion and continued progress toward achieving the Company's diversity goals. DEI quarterly reviews are completed by management to increase diverse representation at all levels of the organization by: 1) creating consistent visibility to employee demographic data and trends, 2) highlighting female and racially diverse talent, and 3) increasing leadership accountability for creating a diverse and inclusive workplace. Mentorship programs have been created to grow the next generation of talent at the Company by pairing employee resource groups (“ERGs”)  leadership, women, people of color, and early career talent with the Company’s leaders to encourage leadership development and mentor allyship. The Company also prioritizes investing in its communities by supporting individuals and organizations that advance DEI goals across cities and regions in which it operates.\nThe Company has nine ERGs with more than 90 local chapters across the globe, and two regional inclusion councils newly formed in 2021. Over 12,000 employees are engaged with the Company’s ERGs and Inclusion Councils. These ERGs are formed around various dimensions of diversity and participation across groups is encouraged. The ERGs include Abilities (including cognitive, social-emotional, and physical abilities), African Ancestry, Asian Heritage, Hispanic/Latino, Developing Professionals, Pride & Allies (LGBTQ+), Veterans, Women, and Working Parents. Company executives and leaders actively participate, sponsor and engage with the ERGs. The CEO and more than 75% of his direct staff also serve as an executive sponsor for one or more ERGs providing executive sponsorship and support, which serve as one of the cornerstones for inclusion and engagement of talent at scale.\nThe Company launched a racial equity roadmap in 2020 with ten actions to confront racism and social injustice throughout its communities and across the world, which includes specific goals across culture, career, and community focus areas. Each of the ten items were initiated in 2021. Through the RISE (Reach. Inspire. Support. Engage.) Community program the Company provides Scholar students access to expanded experiential learning beyond their classrooms. The Company’s mission is to help its RISE Scholars discover their passions, expose them to business, technology, potential STEM career opportunities, and help to develop them as leaders.\nThe Company is a signatory of Paradigm for Parity committing to addressing the gender gap in corporate leadership. The Company also participates in the Business Roundtable Diversity & Inclusion Index, where many of the largest U.S.-based employers are committed to building a more inclusive environment. The Company's CEO was among the signatories of the CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion.\n8\nEmployee Wellness, Health and Safety\nThe Company is committed to providing competitive benefits to attract and retain talent, that vary by country, including benefits and programs to support the broad wellness of its employees’ healthy lifestyles, mental health, and retirement readiness. The Company also supports its employees and promotes work/life balance through benefits such as paid parental leave, paid time off, flexible work arrangement and virtual/hybrid working model policies.\nIn 2021, the Company's continued commitment to ensuring the health and safety of its employees and supply chain partners was demonstrated through its agile and adaptive response to the ongoing coronavirus pandemic (“COVID-19”). Under the guidance of the Chief Medical Officer, the Company was able to sustain business operations by implementing safety measures and wellness policies, oversight, and systems, including expansion of the Employee Assistance Program to be available globally. The Company maintained virtual working for its office employees around the globe where feasible, while providing the necessary technical and collaboration support to enable its employees to succeed in a virtual working environment. The Company believes its adopted hybrid work model is likely to outlast the pandemic and will be a key enabler to support the broad needs of its employee whether they perform work on-site to fully virtual. Additional information regarding the Company's response to COVID-19 is available under the caption “COVID-19 Pandemic” in Item 7.\nThe Company’s Environmental, Health and Safety (“EHS”) Management System Plan describes the core elements of health and safety responsibility and accountability, including policies and procedures, designed in alignment with global standards, the Company’s Code of Business Ethics, applicable law and individual facility needs. Health and safety requirements apply to all employees and operating unit locations worldwide, including all manufacturing facilities, distribution centers, warehouses, field service centers, retail, office locations and mobile units, as well as to the Company's subsidiaries and joint ventures (in which the Company exercises decision making control over operations). Legal requirements may vary in different countries in which the Company’s facilities are located. Primary measures of safety performance include Total Recordable Incident Rate (\"TRIR\") and the Lost Time Incident Rate (\"LTIR\") based upon the number of incidents per 100 employees (or per 200,000 work hours). Through December 2021, the Company reported a TRIR of 0.65, a LTIR of 0.22 and zero work-related fatalities. Reported total workforce numbers include employees and supervised contractors.\nGovernance and Oversight\nThe CEO and the management Executive Committee are entrusted with developing and advancing the Company’s human capital strategy which is reviewed annually with periodic updates on progress with the Board. The Chief Human Resources Officer (“CHRO”), who reports directly to the CEO, is charged with the development and stewardship of this strategy on an enterprise-wide basis. This incorporates a broad range of dimensions, including culture, values, labor and employee relations, leadership expectations and capabilities, talent development, performance management and total rewards. Each year, the Company conducts an extensive talent review with its CEO where the leadership team, key talent, succession plans and new investments are reviewed. Afterwards, the CEO, CHRO, and Chief Talent Officers lead a talent review with the Compensation & Talent Development Committee of the Board and the entire membership of the Board, at least annually. In 2021, the CHRO presented a 3-year strategic plan to the Executive Committee and the Board on human capital and talent strategies.\nCode of Business Ethics, Workplace Harassment Prevention, and Managing Unconscious Bias training, among others, are provided to employees and the content is regularly reviewed and updated. All employees have access to the INTEGRITY@SBD platform where support, guidance and resources are available. Employees are encouraged to raise any concerns through multiple channels, including through the confidential Integrity Helpline, without fear of retaliation or retribution.\nAdditional information regarding the Company's Human Capital programs and initiatives is available in the Company's Annual Sustainability Report and in the Company’s Environmental, Social and Governance Report located under the Social Responsibility section of the Company’s website. The information on the Company’s website is not, and is not intended to be, part of this Form 10-K and is not incorporated into this report by reference.\nResearch and Development Costs\nResearch and development costs, which are classified in Selling, general and administrative (\"SG&A\"), were $276.3 million, $200.0 million and $240.8 million for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2021, the Company returned to normalized spend levels as the Company continues to focus on becoming known as one of the world's greatest innovators and remains committed to generating new core and breakthrough innovations. The reduction in spending in 2020 versus 2019 was primarily due to the temporary cost actions taken in response to COVID-19.\n9\nAvailable Information\nThe Company’s website is located at http://www.stanleyblackanddecker.com.

    "text": "The Company’s business, operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below, together with all of the other information in this Annual Report on Form 10-K, including those risks set forth under the heading entitled \"Cautionary Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\" in Item 7, and in other documents that the Company files with the SEC, before making any investment decision with respect to its securities. If any of the risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop, the Company’s business, financial condition, results of operations and future growth prospects could change. Under these circumstances, the trading prices of the Company’s securities could decline, and you could lose all or part of your investment in the Company’s securities.\nBusiness and Operational Risks\nThe Company’s business is subject to risks associated with sourcing and manufacturing.\nThe Company imports large quantities of finished goods, component parts and raw materials. Lead times for these items vary significantly and are increasing in light of global shortages of critical components, including semiconductors. Global supply chain constraints in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic continue to decrease the Company's visibility into availability and lead times for the products and their component parts and raw materials. In addition, the Company’s ability to import these items in a timely and cost-effective manner has been and may continue to be affected by conditions at ports or issues that otherwise affect transportation and warehousing providers, such as fluctuations in freight costs, port and shipping capacity, labor disputes and shortages, severe weather due to climate change or increased homeland security requirements in the U.S. and other countries. In 2021, the Company experienced significantly higher freight costs compared to freight costs incurred in 2020 and 2019. These issues have and could delay importation of products or require the Company to locate alternative ports or warehousing providers to avoid disruption to customers. These alternatives have not and in the future may not be available on short notice or have and could result in higher transit costs, which could have an adverse impact on the Company’s business and financial condition.\nSubstantially all of its import operations are subject to customs requirements and to tariffs and quotas set by governments through mutual agreements, bilateral actions or, in some cases unilateral action. In addition, the countries in which the Company’s products and materials are manufactured or imported from (including importation into the U.S. of the Company's products manufactured overseas) may from time to time impose additional quotas, duties, tariffs or other restrictions on its imports (including restrictions on manufacturing operations) or adversely modify existing restrictions. In recent years, changes in U.S. policy regarding international trade, including import and export regulation and international trade agreements, have negatively impacted the Company’s business. For example, in 2018 the U.S. imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum as well as on goods imported from China and certain other countries, which resulted in retaliatory tariffs by China and other countries. Similar U.S. actions and any corresponding retaliatory efforts, could result in an increase in supply chain costs that the Company may not be able to offset or otherwise adversely impact the Company’s results of operations. Imports are also subject to unpredictable foreign currency variation which may increase the Company’s cost of goods sold. Adverse changes in these import costs and restrictions, or failure by the Company’s suppliers to comply with customs regulations or similar laws, could harm the Company’s business.\nThe Company’s operations are also subject to the effects of international trade agreements and regulations such as the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and the activities and regulations of the World Trade Organization. Although these trade agreements generally have positive effects on trade liberalization, sourcing flexibility and cost of goods by reducing or eliminating the duties and/or quotas assessed on products manufactured in a particular country, trade agreements can also impose requirements that adversely affect the Company’s business, such as setting quotas on products that may be imported from a particular country into key markets including the U.S. or the European Union (\"EU\"), or making it easier for other\n10\ncompanies to compete, by eliminating restrictions on products from countries where the Company’s competitors source products.\nIn addition, the Company has a number of key suppliers in South Korea. Escalation of hostilities with North Korea and/or military action in the region could cause disruptions in the Company's supply chain which could, in turn, cause product shortages, delays in delivery and/or increases in the Company's cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers.\nThe Company also relies on its suppliers to provide high quality products and to comply with applicable laws. The Company’s ability to find qualified suppliers who meet its standards, including a majority having carbon emission reduction targets, and supply products in a timely, cost-effective and efficient manner is a significant challenge with the increasing demand from customers, especially with respect to goods sourced from outside the U.S. For certain products, the Company may rely on one or very few suppliers. A supplier’s failure to meet the Company’s standards, provide products in a timely, cost-effective and efficient manner, or comply with applicable laws is beyond the Company’s control. These issues could have a material negative impact on the Company's business and profitability. Poor quality or an insecure supply chain, may also adversely affect the reliability and reputation of the Company.\nThe effects of climate change, such as extreme weather conditions, could also place capacity constraints on the Company’s supply chain. For example, steel and copper are critical to the design of the Company's products and some countries, including Chile and Australia, where steel and copper are sourced from have experienced and are expected to continue to experience severe weather due to climate change. A severe weather event in these countries could cause disruptions in the Company's supply chain which could, in turn, cause product shortages, delays in delivery and/or increases in the Company's cost incurred to produce and deliver products to its customers.\nThe continued adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and an indeterminate recovery period could have a materially negative impact on the Company’s business, operations, financial condition, results of operations, and liquidity, the nature and extent of which is highly uncertain.\nThe impact of the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, the Company’s business, financial condition, workforce and operations and the operations of its customers, distributors, suppliers and contractors. There continues to be significant uncertainty regarding restrictions on the Company's access to its manufacturing facilities or on its support operations or workforce, or similar limitations for its distributors and suppliers. These measures have limited and could continue to limit customer demand and has and could continue to limit the Company's capacity to meet customer demand, which could have a material negative impact on its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected global economics and markets and has resulted in disruptions in commerce that will continue to evolve, including with respect to financial and other economic activities, services, travel and supply chains. Global and national health concerns could lead to further and/or increased volatility in global capital and credit markets. A sustained downturn in customer demand or other economic conditions could result in material charges related to bad debt or inventory write-offs, restructuring charges, or impairments of long-lived assets, including both tangible and intangible assets. Furthermore, a sustained downturn in financial markets and asset values could adversely affect the Company’s cost of capital, liquidity and access to capital markets, in addition to potentially increasing its pension funding obligations to ensure its pension plans continue to be adequately funded.\nThe ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has caused the Company to modify its business practices (including employee travel, employee work locations, and cancellation of physical participation in meetings, events and conferences). The Company has announced an internal vaccine protocol. The Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”) had issued rules requiring that employers with more than 100 employees in the U.S. have employee populations that are fully vaccinated against or tested weekly for COVID-19, however, the implementation of the OSHA rules was stayed by the Supreme Court on January 13, 2022 and the OSHA withdrew the rules on January 25, 2022. Although OSHA left open the possibility that it might try to finalize a permanent vaccine and testing rule in the future, vaccine protocols are currently state and employer-specific. It is currently not possible to predict with certainty the impact any future rules and the Company's vaccination policy will have on its workforce. Additional vaccine mandates may also be implemented in other jurisdictions in which the Company operates and the Company may take further actions as may be required by government authorities or that the Company determines are in the best interests of its employees, customers, distributors, suppliers and contractors. There is no certainty that such measures will be sufficient to mitigate the risks posed by the virus, and the Company's ability to perform critical functions could be harmed and vaccine mandates could result in higher than usual employee attrition rates and adversely impact the operations of the Company if higher than usual customer demand of its products continues similar to demand levels experienced during the second half of 2020 and during 2021. Furthermore, as a result of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, in 2020 the Company executed certain temporary and permanent cost reduction measures including adjustments to its supply chain and manufacturing labor base to match the demand environment and reductions in staffing, compensation and benefits in a manner that allows the Company to respond to changes in demand, some of which were reversed and some were made\n11\npermanent. These cost reduction measures may not prove to be successful and the Company may need to undertake further measures that could adversely impact its business and/or its ability to ramp up operations in a timely manner.\nContinued uncertainties related to the COVID-19 pandemic have caused, and may continue to cause, disruptions in the Company's supply chain, cause delay, or limit the ability of, customers to continue to operate and perform, including in making timely payments to the Company, result in the Company's inability to meet its consumers' and customers' needs due to disruptions in manufacturing and supply arrangements caused by the loss or disruption of essential manufacturing and supply elements, and cause other unpredictable events.\nIn addition, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic may also limit the Company’s resources or delay the Company’s ability to implement strategic initiatives. If strategic initiatives are delayed, such initiatives may not achieve some or all of the expected benefits, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s competitive position, business, financial condition and results of operations and cash flows.\nThe continued spread of COVID-19 has caused, and may continue to cause, significant reductions in demand or significant volatility in demand for certain of the Company’s products. As lockdowns occurred in the first and second quarters of 2020 and the work from home trend continued in 2021, those subject to lockdowns and working from home engaged in home improvement projects in large numbers, and demand for the Company’s products at its retail partners increased significantly. As different geographical areas anticipate and begin moving into a recovery era, demand for the Company’s products may decrease as focus shifts to activities outside the home.\nThe degree to which COVID-19 ultimately affects the Company’s business, liquidity, results and operations will depend on future developments, which continue to be highly uncertain and cannot be predicted. These uncertainties, include, but are not limited to, the duration and spread of the outbreak and the resurgence in cases,, its severity, the actions to contain the virus or treat its impact, the availability of vaccines, effectiveness against new variants of COVID-19 and achievement of sufficient vaccination levels, supply chain disruptions, competition in the labor market and how quickly and to what extent economic and operating conditions can become more predictable and certain.\nChanges in customer preferences, the inability to maintain mutually beneficial relationships with large customers, inventory reductions by customers, and the inability to penetrate new channels of distribution could adversely affect the Company’s business.\nThe Company has certain significant customers, particularly home centers and major retailers. In 2021, the two largest customers comprised approximately 29% of net sales, with U.S. and international mass merchants and home centers collectively comprising approximately 46% of net sales. The loss or material reduction of business, the lack of success of sales initiatives, or changes in customer preferences or loyalties for the Company’s products, related to any such significant customer could have a material adverse impact on the Company’s results of operations and cash flows. In addition, the Company’s major customers are volume purchasers, a few of which are much larger than the Company and have strong bargaining power with suppliers. This limits the ability to recover cost increases through higher selling prices. Furthermore, unanticipated inventory adjustments by these customers can have a negative impact on the Company's net sales.\nIn times of tough economic conditions, the Company has experienced significant distributor inventory corrections reflecting de-stocking of the supply chain associated with difficult credit markets. Such distributor de-stocking exacerbated sales volume declines pertaining to weak end user demand and the broader economic recession. The Company’s results may be adversely impacted in future periods by such customer inventory adjustments. Further, the inability to continue to penetrate new channels of distribution may have a negative impact on the Company’s future results.\nThe Company faces active global competition and if it does not compete effectively, its business may suffer.\nThe Company faces active competition and resulting pricing pressures. The Company’s products compete on the basis of, among other things, its reputation for product quality, its well-known brands, price, innovation and customer service capabilities. The Company competes with both larger and smaller companies that offer the same or similar products and services or that produce different products appropriate for the same uses. These companies are often located in countries such as China, Taiwan and India where labor and other production costs are substantially lower than in the U.S., Canada and Western Europe. Also, certain large customers offer house brands that compete with some of the Company’s product offerings as a lower-cost alternative. To remain profitable and defend market share, the Company must maintain a competitive cost structure, develop new products and services, lead product innovation, respond to competitor innovations and enhance its existing products in a timely manner. The Company may not be able to compete effectively on all of these fronts and with all of its competitors, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on its sales and profit margins.\n12\nOperations Excellence, one element of the SBD Operating Model, is a continuous operational improvement process applied to many aspects of the Company’s business such as procurement, quality in manufacturing, maximizing customer fill rates, integrating acquisitions and other key business processes. In the event the Company is not successful in effectively applying the Operations Excellence principles to its key business processes, including those of acquired businesses, its ability to compete and future earnings could be adversely affected.\nIn addition, the Company may have to reduce prices on its products and services, or make other concessions, to stay competitive and retain market share. Price reductions taken by the Company in response to customer and competitive pressures, as well as price reductions and promotional actions taken to drive demand that may not result in anticipated sales levels, could also negatively impact its business. The Company engages in restructuring actions, sometimes entailing shifts of production to low-cost countries, as part of its efforts to maintain a competitive cost structure. If the Company does not execute restructuring actions well, its ability to meet customer demand may decline, or earnings may otherwise be adversely impacted. Similarly, if such efforts to reform the cost structure are delayed relative to competitors or other market factors, the Company may lose market share and profits.\nCustomer consolidation could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nA significant portion of the Company’s products are sold through home centers and mass merchant distribution channels in the U.S. and Europe. A consolidation of retailers in both North America and abroad has occurred over time and the increasing size and importance of individual customers creates risk of exposure to potential volume loss. The loss of certain larger home centers as customers would have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business.\nLow demand for new products and the inability to develop and introduce new products at favorable margins could adversely impact the Company’s performance and prospects for future growth.\nThe Company’s competitive advantage is due in part to its ability to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner at favorable margins. The uncertainties associated with developing and introducing new products, such as market demand, the unavailability of raw materials necessary for production of the Company's products and costs of development and production, may impede the successful development and introduction of new products on a consistent basis. Introduction of new technology may result in higher costs to the Company than that of the technology replaced. That increase in costs, which may continue indefinitely or until increased demand and greater availability in the sources of the new technology drive down its cost, could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations. Market acceptance of the new products introduced in recent years and scheduled for introduction in future years may not meet sales expectations due to various factors, such as the failure to accurately predict market demand, end-user preferences, evolving industry standards, or the emergence of new or disruptive technologies. Moreover, the ultimate success and profitability of the new products may depend on the Company’s ability to resolve technical and technological challenges in a timely and cost-effective manner, and to achieve manufacturing efficiencies. The Company’s investments in productive capacity and commitments to fund advertising and product promotions in connection with these new products could erode profits if those expectations are not met.\nThe pace of technological change continues to accelerate and the Company's ability to react effectively to such change may present significant competitive risks.\nThe pace of technological change is increasing at an exponential rate. The continued creation, development and advancement of new technologies such as 5G data networks, artificial intelligence, blockchain, quantum computing, data analytics, 3-D printing, robotics, sensor technology, data storage, neural networks, augmented reality, amongst others, as well as other technologies in the future that are not foreseen today, continue to transform the Company’s processes, products and services.\nIn order to remain competitive, the Company will need to stay abreast of such technologies, require its employees to continue to learn and adapt to new technologies and be able to integrate them into its current and future business models, products, services and processes and also guard against existing and new competitors disrupting its business using such technologies. The Company’s strategy, value creation model, operating model and innovation ecosystem have important technological elements and many of the Company’s products and offerings are based on technological advances, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics and the Internet of Things. In addition, the Company will need to compete for talent in a competitive market that is familiar with such technologies including upskilling its workforce. Higher than expected employee attrition rates may also result in difficulties to recruit and obtain talent needed to compete effectively. There can be no assurance that the Company will continue to compete effectively with its industry peers due to technological changes, which could result in a material adverse effect on the Company's business and results of operations.\nThe Company has significant operations outside of the United States, which are subject to political, legal, economic and other risks arising from operating outside of the United States.\n13\nThe Company generates a significant portion of its total revenue outside of the United States. Business operations outside of the United States are subject to political, economic and other risks inherent in operating in certain countries, such as:\n•\nthe difficulty of enforcing agreements and protecting assets through legal systems outside the U.S. including intellectual property rights, which may not be recognized, and which the Company may not be able to protect outside the U.S. to the same extent as under U.S. law;\n•\nmanaging widespread operations and enforcing internal policies and procedures such as compliance with U.S. and foreign anti-bribery, anti-corruption, and sanctions regulations;\n•\ntrade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements including those related to the U.S.'s relationship with China;\n•\nthe application of certain labor regulations outside of the United States;\n•\ncompliance with a wide variety of non-U.S. laws and regulations;\n•\nongoing stability or changes in the general political and economic conditions in the countries where the Company operates, particularly in emerging markets;\n•\nthe threat of nationalization and expropriation;\n•\nincreased costs and risks of doing business and managing a workforce in a wide variety of jurisdictions;\n•\nthe increased possibility of cyber threats in certain jurisdictions;\n•\ngovernment controls limiting importation of goods;\n•\ngovernment controls limiting payments to suppliers for imported goods;\n•\nlimitations on, or impacts from, the repatriation of foreign earnings; and\n•\nexposure to wage, price and capital controls.\nChanges in the political or economic environments in the countries in which the Company operates could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition, results of operations or cash flows. Additionally, the Company is subject to complex U.S., foreign and other local laws and regulations that are applicable to its operations abroad, such as the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, the UK Bribery Act of 2010 and other anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws. Although the Company has implemented internal controls, policies and procedures and employee training and compliance programs to deter prohibited practices, such measures may not be effective in preventing employees, contractors or agents from violating or circumventing such internal policies and violating applicable laws and regulations. Any determination that the Company has violated anti-bribery or anti-corruption laws or sanctions regulations could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition. Compliance with international and U.S. laws and regulations that apply to the Company’s international operations increases the cost of doing business in foreign jurisdictions. Violations of such laws and regulations may result in severe fines and penalties, criminal sanctions, administrative remedies or restrictions on business conduct, and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s reputation, its ability to attract and retain employees, its business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company’s success depends on its ability to improve productivity and streamline operations to control or reduce costs.\nThe Company is committed to continuous productivity improvement and evaluating opportunities to reduce fixed costs, simplify or improve processes, and eliminate excess capacity. The Company has undertaken restructuring actions, the savings of which may be mitigated by many factors, including economic weakness, inflation, competitive pressures, higher labor costs and decisions to increase costs in areas such as sales promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed. Failure to achieve, or delays in achieving, projected levels of efficiencies and cost savings from such measures, or unanticipated inefficiencies resulting from manufacturing and administrative reorganization actions in progress or contemplated, would adversely affect the Company’s business and financial results.\nThe performance of the Company may suffer from business disruptions with catastrophic losses affecting distribution centers and other infrastructure, or other costs associated with information technology, system implementations, or cyber security risks.\nThe Company relies heavily on digital technology, including from third parties, to manage and operate its businesses and record and process transactions. Digital technology plays a crucial role in effectively operating the Company’s physical operations, notably manufacturing sites, distribution centers, security alarm monitoring facilities, offices and processing centers, which are distributed in various geographic locations. Factors that are hard to predict or are beyond the Company’s control, like weather (including any potential effects of climate change), natural disasters, supply and commodity shortages, fire, explosions, acts or threats of war or terrorism, political unrest, cybersecurity breaches, sabotage, generalized labor unrest or public health crises, including pandemics, could damage or disrupt the Company’s digital technology infrastructure, or that of its suppliers or distributors. If the Company does not effectively plan for or respond to disruptions in its operations, or cannot quickly repair\n14\ndamage to its systems, the Company may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products and services to its customers, and the quality and safety of its products and services might be negatively affected. If a material or extended disruption occurs, the Company may lose its customers’ or business partners’ confidence or suffer damage to its reputation, and long-term consumer demand for its products and services could decline. Although the Company maintains business interruption insurance, it may not fully protect the Company against all adverse effects that could result from significant disruptions. These events could materially and adversely affect the Company’s product sales, financial condition, results of operations, and reputation.\nIn addition, the Company is in the process of system integrations, conversions, and capability additions such as eCommerce, Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics to drive enhanced business outcomes. There can be no assurances that expected expense or revenue synergies will be achieved or that there will not be delays to the expected timing of system integrations, conversions or capability additions. It is possible the costs to complete the system integrations, conversions or capability additions may exceed expectations, and that significant costs may be incurred that will require immediate expense recognition as opposed to capitalization. The risk of disruption to key operations and overall business is increased when complex system changes, such as integrations, conversions or capability additions are undertaken. If systems fail to function effectively, or become damaged, operational delays may ensue and the Company may be forced to make significant expenditures to remedy such issues. Any significant disruption in the Company’s digital technology could have a material adverse impact on its business and results.\nDespite efforts to prevent such situations and maintaining insurance policies and loss control and risk management practices that partially mitigate these risks, the Company’s digital technologies may be affected by damage or interruption from, among other causes, power outages, system failures or cyber attacks.\nIndustry and Economic Risks\nThe Company’s results of operations could be negatively impacted by inflationary or deflationary economic conditions which could affect the ability to obtain raw materials, component parts, freight, energy, labor and sourced finished goods in a timely and cost-effective manner, as well as lead to changes in interest rate environments which impact its cost of funds, the general strength of the economy and demand for its products in the market.\nThe Company’s products are manufactured using both ferrous and non-ferrous metals including, but not limited to, steel, zinc, copper, brass, aluminum, and nickel. Additionally, the Company uses other commodity-based materials for components and packaging including, but not limited to, plastics, resins, wood and corrugated products. The Company’s cost base also reflects significant elements for freight, energy and labor. The Company also sources certain finished goods directly from vendors. If the Company is unable to mitigate inflationary increases through various customer pricing actions and cost reduction initiatives, its profitability may be adversely affected.\nConversely, in the event there is deflation, the Company may experience pressure from its customers to reduce prices, and there can be no assurance that the Company would be able to reduce its cost base (through negotiations with suppliers or other measures) to offset any such price concessions which could adversely impact results of operations and cash flows.\nFurther, as a result of inflationary or deflationary economic conditions, the Company believes it is possible that a limited number of suppliers may either cease operations or require additional financial assistance from the Company in order to fulfill their obligations. In a limited number of circumstances, the magnitude of the Company’s purchases of certain items is of such significance that a change in established relationships with suppliers or increase in the costs of purchased raw materials, component parts or finished goods could result in manufacturing interruptions, delays, inefficiencies or an inability to market products. Changes in value-added tax rebates, currently available to the Company or to its suppliers, could also increase the costs of the Company’s manufactured products, as well as purchased products and components, and could adversely affect the Company’s results.\nIn addition, many of the Company’s products incorporate battery technology. As the world moves towards a lower-carbon economy and as other industries begin to adopt similar battery technology for use in their products or increase their current consumption of battery technology, the increased demand could place capacity constraints on the Company’s supply chain. In addition, increased demand for battery technology may also increase the costs to the Company for both the battery cells as well as the underlying raw materials such as cobalt and lithium, among others. If the Company is unable to mitigate any possible supply constraints, related increased costs or drive alternative technology through innovation, its profitably and financial results could be negatively impacted.\nUncertainty about the financial stability of economies outside the U.S. could have a significant adverse effect on the Company's business, results of operations and financial condition.\n15\nThe Company generates approximately 40% of its revenues outside the U.S., including 17% from Europe and 14% from various emerging market countries. Each of the Company’s segments generates sales in these marketplaces. While the Company believes any downturn in the European or emerging marketplaces might be offset to some degree by the relative stability in North America, the Company’s future growth, profitability and financial liquidity could be affected, in several ways, including but not limited to the following:\n•\ndepressed consumer and business confidence may decrease demand for products and services;\n•\ncustomers may implement cost reduction initiatives or delay purchases to address inventory levels;\n•\nsignificant declines of foreign currency values in countries where the Company operates could impact both the revenue growth and overall profitability in those geographies;\n•\na slowing or contracting Chinese economy could reduce China’s consumption and negatively impact the Company’s sales in that region, as well as globally;\n•\na devaluation of foreign currencies could have an effect on the credit worthiness (as well as the availability of funds) of customers in those regions impacting the collectability of receivables;\n•\na devaluation of foreign currencies could have an adverse effect on the value of financial assets of the Company in the effected countries; and\n•\nthe impact of an event (individual country default, Brexit, or break up of the Euro) could have an adverse impact on the global credit markets and global liquidity potentially impacting the Company’s ability to access these credit markets and to raise capital.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates which could negatively impact profitability.\nThe Company manufactures and sells its products in many countries throughout the world. As a result, there is exposure to foreign currency risk as the Company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Argentine Peso, Chinese Renminbi (“RMB”) and the Taiwan Dollar. In preparing its financial statements, for foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates, while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates. With respect to the effects on translated earnings, if the U.S. dollar strengthens relative to local currencies, the Company’s earnings could be negatively impacted. Although the Company utilizes risk management tools, including hedging, as it deems appropriate, to mitigate a portion of potential market fluctuations in foreign currencies, there can be no assurance that such measures will result in all market fluctuation exposure being eliminated. The Company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-U.S. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries but may choose to do so in certain instances.\nThe Company sources many products from China and other low-cost countries for resale in other regions. To the extent the RMB or other currencies appreciate, the Company may experience cost increases on such purchases. The Company may not be successful at implementing customer pricing or other actions in an effort to mitigate the related cost increases and thus its profitability may be adversely impacted.\nFinancing Risks\nThe Company has incurred, and may incur in the future, significant indebtedness, and may in the future issue additional equity securities, including in connection with mergers or acquisitions, which may impact the manner in which it conducts business or the Company’s access to external sources of liquidity. The potential issuance of such securities may limit the Company’s ability to implement elements of its growth strategy and may have a dilutive effect on earnings.\nAs described in\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\n, of the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nin\nItem 8\n, the Company has a five-year $2.5 billion committed credit facility and $2.0 billion 364-day committed credit facilities. No amounts were outstanding against either of these facilities on January 1, 2022. As of January 1, 2022, the Company had $4.4 billion principal amount of indebtedness.\nThe instruments and agreements governing certain of the Company’s current indebtedness contain requirements or restrictive covenants that include, among other things:\n•\na limitation on creating liens on certain property of the Company and its subsidiaries;\n•\na restriction on entering into certain sale-leaseback transactions;\n•\ncustomary events of default. If an event of default occurs and is continuing, the Company might be required to repay all amounts outstanding under the respective instrument or agreement; and\n16\n•\nmaintenance of a specified financial ratio. The Company has an interest coverage covenant that must be maintained to permit continued access to its committed revolving credit facilities. The interest coverage ratio tested for covenant compliance compares adjusted Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization to adjusted Interest Expense (\"adjusted EBITDA\"/\"adjusted Interest Expense\"); such adjustments to interest or EBITDA include, but are not limited to, removal of non-cash interest expense and stock-based compensation expense. The interest coverage ratio must not be less than 2.5 times through December 31, 2021 and not less than 3.5 times thereafter and is computed quarterly, on a rolling twelve months (last twelve months) basis. Under this covenant definition, the interest coverage ratio was 14.9 times EBITDA or higher in each of the 2021 quarterly measurement periods. Management does not believe it is reasonably likely the Company will breach this covenant. Failure to maintain this ratio could adversely affect further access to liquidity.\nFuture instruments and agreements governing indebtedness may impose other restrictive conditions or covenants. Such covenants could restrict the Company in the manner in which it conducts business and operations as well as in the pursuit of its growth and acquisition strategy.\nThe Company is exposed to counterparty risk in its hedging arrangements.\nFrom time to time, the Company enters into arrangements with financial institutions to hedge exposure to fluctuations in currency and interest rates, including forward contracts, options and swap agreements. The Company may incur significant losses from hedging activities due to factors such as demand volatility. The failure of one or more counterparties to the Company’s hedging arrangements to fulfill their obligations could adversely affect the Company’s results of operations.\nTight capital and credit markets or the failure to maintain credit ratings could adversely affect the Company by limiting the Company’s ability to borrow or otherwise access liquidity.\nThe Company’s long-term growth plans are dependent on, among other things, the availability of funding to support corporate initiatives and complete appropriate acquisitions and the ability to increase sales of existing product lines. While the Company has not encountered financing difficulties to date, the capital and credit markets have experienced extreme volatility and disruption in the past and may again in the future. Market conditions could make it more difficult for the Company to borrow or otherwise obtain the cash required for significant new corporate initiatives and acquisitions.\nFurthermore, there could be a number of follow-on effects from a credit crisis on the Company’s businesses, including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays; inability of customers to obtain credit to finance purchases of the Company’s products and services and/or customer insolvencies.\nIn addition, the major rating agencies regularly evaluate the Company for purposes of assigning credit ratings. The Company’s ability to access the credit markets, and the cost of these borrowings, is affected by the strength of its credit ratings and current market conditions. Failure to maintain credit ratings that are acceptable to investors may adversely affect the cost and other terms upon which the Company is able to obtain financing, as well as its access to the capital markets.\nDiscontinuation, reform or replacement of the London Inter-bank Offered Rate (\"LIBOR\") and other benchmark rates, or uncertainty related to the potential for any of the foregoing, may adversely affect the Company.\nA portion of the Company’s indebtedness bears interest at rates that fluctuate with changes in certain short-term prevailing interest rates, including the LIBOR. In March 2021, UK Financial Conduct Authority announced that all LIBOR settings will either cease to be provided by any administrator or no longer be representative immediately after December 31, 2021. Banks currently reporting information used to set U.S. dollar LIBOR are presently expected to stop doing so during 2023. In addition, other regulators have suggested reforming or replacing other benchmark rates. These may be replaced by the Secured Overnight Financing Rate or other benchmark rates over the next several years. The discontinuation, reform or replacement of LIBOR or any other benchmark rates may have an unpredictable impact on contractual mechanics in the credit markets or cause disruption to the broader financial markets. These changes, and related uncertainty as to the nature of such potential discontinuation, reform or replacement may create incremental uncertainty in obtaining financing or increase the cost of borrowing. At this time, the Company cannot predict the overall effect of the modification or discontinuation of LIBOR or the establishment of alternative benchmark rates.\nThe Company is exposed to credit risk on its accounts receivable.\nThe Company’s outstanding trade receivables are not generally covered by collateral or credit insurance. While the Company has procedures to monitor and limit exposure to credit risk on its trade and non-trade receivables, there can be no assurance\n17\nsuch procedures will effectively limit its credit risk and avoid losses, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and operating results.\nIf the Company were required to write-down all or part of its goodwill, indefinite-lived trade names, or other definite-lived intangible assets, its net income and net worth could be materially adversely affected.\nAs a result of the Black and Decker merger and other acquisitions, the Company has approximately $8.8 billion of goodwill, approximately $2.5 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and approximately $2.2 billion of net definite-lived intangible assets on January 1, 2022. The Company is required to periodically, at least annually, determine if its goodwill or indefinite-lived trade names have become impaired, in which case it would write down the impaired portion of the asset. The definite-lived intangible assets, including customer relationships, are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are evaluated for impairment when appropriate. Impairment of intangible assets may be triggered by developments outside of the Company’s control, such as worsening economic conditions, technological change, intensified competition or other factors, which could have an adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and results of operations.\nIf the investments in employee benefit plans do not perform as expected, the Company may have to contribute additional amounts to these plans, which would otherwise be available to cover operating expenses or other business purposes.\nThe Company sponsors pension and other post-retirement defined benefit plans. The Company’s defined benefit plan assets are currently invested in equity securities, government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments and insurance contracts. The Company’s funding policy is generally to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with applicable law which require, among other things, that the Company make cash contributions to under-funded pension plans. During 2021, the Company made cash contributions to its defined benefit plans of approximatel\ny $40 million a\nnd expects to contribu\nte $41 million t\no its defined benefit plans i\nn 2022.\nThere can be no assurance that the value of the defined benefit plan assets, or the investment returns on those plan assets, will be sufficient in the future. It is therefore possible that the Company may be required to make higher cash contributions to the plans in future years which would reduce the cash available for other business purposes, and that the Company will have to recognize a significant pension liability adjustment which would decrease the net assets of the Company and result in higher expense in future years. The fair value of the defined benefit plan assets on January 1, 2022 was approximate\nly $2.6 billion.\nStrategic Risks\nThe successful execution of the Company’s business strategy depends on its ability to recruit, retain, train, motivate, and develop employees and execute effective succession planning.\nThe success of the Company’s efforts to grow its business depends on the contributions and abilities of key executives and management personnel, its sales force and other personnel, including the ability of its sales force to adapt to any changes made in the sales organization and achieve adequate customer coverage. The Company must therefore continue to recruit, retain, train and motivate management, sales and other personnel sufficiently to maintain its current business and support its projected growth. In addition, the Company must invest heavily in reskilling and upskilling its employees, including placing an emphasis on lifelong learning. Additionally, any unplanned turnover or inability to attract and retain key employees could have a negative effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nA shortage of key employees might jeopardize the Company’s ability to implement its growth strategy, and changes in the key management team can result in loss of continuity, loss of accumulated knowledge, departure of other key employees, disruptions to the Company’s operations and inefficiency during transitional periods. The Company’s reputation, business, revenue and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected if it is unable to recruit, retain, train, motivate, and develop employees and successfully execute organizational change and management transitions at leadership levels.\nThe Company’s acquisitions, exiting of businesses, divestitures, strategic investments and alliances and joint ventures, as well as general business reorganizations, may result in financial results that are different than expected and certain risks for its business and operations.\nAs part of the Company's strategy, it may acquire businesses or assets, divest businesses or assets, enter into strategic alliances and joint ventures, and make investments to further its business (collectively, “business combination and investment transactions”), and also handle any post-closing issues, such as integration. For example, in 2021, the Company completed the MTD Holdings Inc. (\"MTD\") and Excel Industries (\"Excel\") acquisitions, as well as smaller acquisitions, and may make\n18\nadditional acquisitions in the future. In December 2021, the Company announced it entered into an agreement to divest its commercial electronic security and healthcare businesses, which it expects to complete in the first half of 202\n2, pending regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions.\nRisks associated with business combination and investment transactions include the following, any of which could adversely\naffect the Company's financial results, including its effective tax rate:\n•\nthe failure to identify the most suitable candidates for acquisitions;\n•\ndifficulty in finding buyers or alternative exit strategies on acceptable terms in a timely manner, or the Company may dispose of a business at a price or on terms that are less desirable than the Company had anticipated for a divestiture;\n•\nthe ability to conduct due diligence with respect to business combination and investment transactions, and the ability to evaluate the results of such due diligence, which is dependent on the veracity and completeness of statements and\ndisclosures made or actions taken by third parties or their representatives and the failure to identify significant issues\nwith the target company’s product quality, financial disclosures, accounting practices or internal control deficiencies or\nthe factors necessary to estimate reasonably accurate costs, timing and other matters;\n•\nfor an acquisition or other combination, the acquired business may have differing or inadequate cybersecurity and\ndata protection controls, which could impact its exposure to data security incidents and potentially increase\nanticipated costs or time to integrate the business;\n•\nthe difficulties and cost in obtaining any necessary regulatory approvals;\n•\nthe ability to identify and close on appropriate acquisition opportunities within desired time frames at reasonable cost;\n•\nthe anticipated additional revenues from the acquired companies do not materialize, despite extensive due diligence;\n•\nthe acquired businesses will lose market acceptance or profitability;\n•\nthe impact of divestitures on the Company's revenue growth may be larger than projected, as the Company may experience greater dis-synergies than expected;\n•\nthe diversion of Company management’s attention and other resources;\n•\nincurring significant restructuring charges and amortization expense, assuming liabilities and ongoing or new lawsuits related to the transaction or otherwise, potential impairment of acquired goodwill and other intangible assets, and increasing the Company's expenses and working capital requirements;\n•\nthe incurrence of unexpected costs and liabilities, including those associated with undisclosed pre-closing regulatory violations by the acquired business;\n•\nfor a divestiture, if the Company does not satisfy pre-closing conditions and necessary regulatory and governmental approvals on acceptable terms, it may prevent the Company from completing the transaction;\n•\ncontinued financial involvement in a divested business, such as through continuing equity ownership, guarantees, indemnities or other financial obligations; and\n•\nthe loss of key personnel, distributors, clients or customers of acquired companies.\nIn addition, the success of the Company’s long-term growth and acquisition strategy will depend in part on successful general reorganization including its ability to:\n•\ncombine businesses, product or service offerings and operations or fully realize all of the anticipated benefits of any particular business combination and investment transaction;\n•\nintegrate departments, systems and procedures; and\n•\nobtain cost savings and other efficiencies from such reorganizations, including the Company's margin resiliency initiative.\nIn addition, the current and the proposed changes to the U.S. and foreign regulatory approval process and requirements in connection with an acquisition may cause approvals to take longer than anticipated to obtain, not be forthcoming or contain burdensome conditions, which may jeopardize, delay or reduce the anticipated benefits of the transaction to the Company and could impede the execution of the Company's business strategy. Failure to effectively integrate acquired companies, strategic investments and alliances, consummate or manage any future acquisitions, exit businesses or consummate divestitures, or general business reorganizations, and mitigate the related risks, may adversely affect the Company’s existing businesses and harm its operational results due to large write-offs, significant restructuring costs, contingent liabilities, substantial depreciation, and/or adverse tax or other consequences. The Company cannot ensure that such integrations and reorganizations will be successfully completed or that all of the planned synergies and other benefits will be realized.\nExpansion of the Company’s activity in emerging markets may result in risks due to differences in business practices and cultures.\nThe Company’s growth plans include efforts to increase revenue from emerging markets through both organic growth and acquisitions. Local business practices in these regions may not comply with U.S. laws, local laws or other laws applicable to the Company. When investigating potential acquisitions, the Company seeks to identify historical practices of target companies that\n19\nwould create liability or other exposures for the Company were they to continue post-completion or as a successor to the target. Where such practices are discovered, the Company assesses the risk to determine whether it is prepared to proceed with the transaction. In assessing the risk, the Company looks at, among other factors, the nature of the violation, the potential liability, including any fines or penalties that might be incurred, the ability to avoid, minimize or obtain indemnity for the risks, and the likelihood that the Company would be able to ensure that any such practices are discontinued following completion of the acquisition through implementation of its own policies and procedures. Due diligence and risk assessment are, however, imperfect processes, and it is possible that the Company will not discover problematic practices until after completion, or that the Company will underestimate the risks associated with historical activities. Should that occur, the Company may incur fees, fines, penalties, injury to its reputation or other damage that could negatively impact the Company's earnings.\nLegal, Tax, Regulatory and Compliance Risks\nThe Company’s brands are important assets of its businesses and violation of its trademark rights by imitators, or the failure of its licensees or vendors to comply with the Company’s product quality, manufacturing requirements, marketing standards, and other requirements could negatively impact revenues and brand reputation. Any inability to protect the Company's other intellectual property rights could also reduce the value of its products and services or diminish its competitiveness.\nThe Company considers its intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights and trade secrets, and licenses held, to be a significant part and valuable aspect of its business. The Company attempts to protect its intellectual property rights through a combination of patent, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, as well as licensing agreements and third-party nondisclosure and assignment agreements.\nThe Company’s trademarks have a reputation for quality and value and are important to the Company's success and competitive position. Unauthorized use of the Company’s trademark rights may not only erode sales of the Company’s products, but may also cause significant damage to its brand name and reputation, interfere with its ability to effectively represent the Company to its customers, contractors, suppliers, and/or licensees, and increase litigation costs. Similarly, failure by licensees or vendors to adhere to the Company’s standards of quality and other contractual requirements could result in loss of revenue, increased litigation, and/or damage to the Company’s reputation and business. There can be no assurance that the Company’s ongoing efforts to protect its brand and trademark rights and ensure compliance with its licensing and vendor agreements will prevent all violations.\nIn addition, the Company's ability to compete could be negatively impacted by its failure to obtain and adequately protect its intellectual property and preserve its associated intellectual property rights, including patents, copyrights, trade secrets, and licenses, as well as its products and any new features of its products or processes. The Company's patent applications may not be approved and any patents owned could be challenged, invalidated or designed around by third parties. In addition, the Company's patents may not be of sufficient scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or commercial advantage.\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to cybersecurity.\nThe Company’s operations rely on the secure processing, storage and transmission of confidential, sensitive, proprietary and other types of information relating to its business operations, as well as confidential and sensitive information about its customers and employees maintained in the Company’s computer systems and networks, certain products and services, and in the computer systems and networks of its third-party vendors. Cyber threats are rapidly evolving as data thieves and hackers have become increasingly sophisticated and carry out direct large-scale, complex attacks against a company or through vendor software supply chain compromises. In particular, the Company is increasingly relying on its digital technology to support its operations as it manages the impact of COVID-19, including supporting remote-work protocols for a substantial number of the Company’s employees in regions impacted by the spread of COVID-19 and future, ongoing hybrid-work protocols, which can increase cyber risks. The Company is not able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks and could be held liable for any resulting material security breach or data loss. In addition, it is not always possible to deter misconduct by employees or third-party vendors.\nBreaches of the Company’s technology systems, or those of the Company’s vendors, whether from circumvention of security systems, denial-of-service attacks or other cyber-attacks, hacking, “phishing” attacks, computer viruses, ransomware or malware, employee or insider error, malfeasance, social engineering, vendor software supply chain compromises, physical breaches or other actions, have and may result in manipulation or corruption of sensitive data, material interruptions or malfunctions in the Company’s or such vendors’ websites, applications, data processing, and certain products and services, or disruption of other business operations. Furthermore, any such breaches could compromise the confidentiality and integrity of material information held by the Company (including information about the Company’s business, employees or customers), as\n20\nwell as sensitive personally identifiable information, the disclosure of which could lead to identity theft. Breaches of the Company’s products that rely on technology and internet connectivity can expose the Company to product and other liability risk and reputational harm. Measures that the Company takes to avoid, detect, mitigate or recover from material incidents, including implementing and conducting training on insider trading policies for the Company’s employees and maintaining contractual obligations for the Company’s third-party vendors, can be expensive, and may be insufficient, circumvented, or may become ineffective.\nThe Company has invested and continues to invest in risk management and information security and data privacy measures in order to protect its systems and data, including employee training, organizational investments, incident response plans, table top exercises and technical defenses. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly intense, complex, and sophisticated global cyber threats. Despite the Company’s best efforts, it is not fully insulated from data breaches and system disruptions. Recent well-publicized security breaches at other companies have led to enhanced government and regulatory scrutiny of the measures taken by companies to protect against cyber-attacks, and may in the future result in heightened cybersecurity requirements, including additional regulatory expectations for oversight of vendors and service providers. Any material breaches of cybersecurity, including the accidental loss, inadvertent disclosure or unapproved dissemination of proprietary information or sensitive or confidential data, or media reports of perceived security vulnerabilities to the Company’s systems, products and services or those of the Company’s third parties could cause the Company to experience reputational harm, loss of customers and revenue, fines, regulatory actions and scrutiny, sanctions or other statutory penalties, litigation, liability for failure to safeguard the Company’s customers’ information, or financial losses that are either not insured against or not fully covered through any insurance maintained by the Company. The report, rumor or assumption regarding a potential breach may have similar results, even if no breach has been attempted or occurred. Any of the foregoing may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company is exposed to risks related to compliance with data privacy laws.\nTo conduct its operations, the Company regularly moves data across national borders, and consequently is subject to a variety of continuously evolving and developing laws and regulations in the United States and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to the Company is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”), which became effective in May 2018, greatly increased the jurisdictional reach of European Union law and added a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Similarly, the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (“CCPA”), which became effective in January 2020, provided, among other things, a new private right of action for data breaches, required companies that process information on California residents to make new disclosures to consumers about their data collection, use and sharing practices, and provided consumers with additional rights. The California Privacy Rights Act of 2020, which will become effective on January 1, 2023, amends and expands the CCPA, creating new industry requirements, consumer privacy rights and enforcement mechanisms. Virginia and Colorado have also passed robust privacy laws that will come into effect on January 1 and July 1, 2023, respectively. The Company's reputation and brand and its ability to attract new customers could also be adversely impacted if the Company fails, or is perceived to have failed, to properly respond to security breaches of its or third party’s information technology systems. Such failure to properly respond could also result in similar exposure to liability.\nAdditionally, other countries have enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. In many cases, these laws and regulations apply not only to transfers between unrelated third parties but also to transfers between the Company and its subsidiaries.\nAll of these evolving compliance and operational requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time. Privacy laws that may be implemented in the future, and court decisions impacting activities across borders, including the Schrems II decision invalidating the EU - U.S. Privacy Shield, will continue to require changes to certain business practices, thereby increasing costs, or may result in negative publicity, require significant management time and attention, and may subject the Company to remedies that may harm its business, including fines or demands or orders that the Company modify or cease existing business practices.\nSignificant judgment and certain estimates are required in determining the Company’s worldwide provision for income taxes. Future tax law changes and audit results may materially increase the Company’s prospective income tax expense.\nThe Company is subject to income taxation in the U.S. as well as numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining the Company’s worldwide income tax provision and accordingly there are many transactions and computations for which the final income tax determination is uncertain. The Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately\n21\nanticipate actual outcomes. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most currently available information, which involves inherent uncertainty. The Company is routinely audited by income tax authorities in many tax jurisdictions. Although management believes the recorded tax estimates are reasonable, the ultimate outcome of any audit (or related litigation) could differ materially from amounts reflected in the Company’s income tax accruals. Additionally, the global income tax provision can be materially impacted due to foreign currency fluctuations against the U.S. dollar since a significant amount of the Company’s earnings are generated outside the United States. Lastly, it is possible that future income tax legislation may be enacted that could have a material impact on the Company’s worldwide income tax provision, cash tax liability, and effective tax rate beginning with the period that such legislation becomes enacted.\nClimate change and climate change legislation or regulations may adversely affect the Company's business.\nThe effects of climate change, such as severe weather, including droughts and water scarcity, could impact the Company’s business. The effects of climate change could also disrupt the Company’s operations by impacting the availability and costs of materials needed for manufacturing and could increase insurance and other operating costs. There may be operational risk due to the significant impact climate change could pose to employees’ lives, the Company’s supply chain, or electrical power availability from climate-related weather events. The Company also face risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy, such as its ability to successfully adopt new technology or to comply with more stringent and increasingly complex environmental regulations or requirements for the Company's manufacturing facilities and business operations, increased prices related to freight and shipping costs and other permitting requirements.\nThere continues to be a lack of consistent climate legislation, which creates economic and regulatory uncertainty. Increased public awareness and concern regarding global climate change may result in more international, regional and/or federal requirements or other stakeholder expectations that could mandate more restrictive or expansive standards, more prescriptive reporting of environmental, social and governance metrics than the voluntary commitments the Company adopted, or require related changes on a more accelerated time frame than the Company anticipates. A number of governmental bodies have finalized, proposed or are contemplating legislative and regulatory changes in response to the potential effect of climate change. Such legislation or regulation has and potentially could include provisions for a “cap and trade” system of allowances and credits or a carbon tax or require increased measurement of metrics and disclosure, among other provisions. The Company currently purchases renewable energy certificates (“RECs”) to mitigate the impact of carbon tax and is also assessing expanding its use of solar panels as an alternative energy source. If carbon tax legislation is changed or adopted, the Company may not be able to mitigate the future impact of carbon tax through the purchase of RECs and the use of solar panels or other measures. The Company may also face reputational risks and risks to the Company's investor confidence and market share if the Company is unable to make progress on the Company's voluntary environmental goals or is unable to keep apace with the progress made by the Company's peers. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements on the Company, they may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, access to credit, capital expenditures, operating results and financial condition.\nThe Company’s failure to continue to successfully avoid, manage, defend, litigate and accrue for claims and litigation could negatively impact its results of operations or cash flows.\nThe Company is exposed to and becomes involved in various litigation matters arising out of the ordinary routine conduct of its business, including, from time to time, actual or threatened litigation relating to such items as commercial transactions, product liability, workers compensation, arrangements between the Company and its distributors, franchisees or vendors, intellectual property claims and regulatory actions.\nIn addition, the Company is subject to environmental laws in each jurisdiction in which business is conducted. Some of the Company’s products incorporate substances that are regulated in some jurisdictions in which it conducts manufacturing operations. The Company has been and could be in the future subject to liability if it does not comply with these regulations. In addition, the Company is currently, and may in the future be held responsible for remedial investigations and clean-up costs resulting from the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment, including sites that have never been owned or operated by the Company but at which it has been identified as a potentially responsible party under federal and state environmental laws and regulations. Changes in environmental and other laws and regulations in both domestic and foreign jurisdictions could adversely affect the Company’s operations due to increased costs of compliance and potential liability for non-compliance.\nThe Company manufactures products, configures and installs security systems and performs various services that create exposure to product and professional liability claims and litigation. The failure of the Company’s products, systems and services to be properly manufactured, configured, installed, designed or delivered, resulting in personal injuries, property damage or business interruption could subject the Company to claims for damages. The Company has and is currently\n22\ndefending product liability claims, some of which have resulted in settlements or monetary judgments against the Company. The costs associated with defending ongoing or future product liability claims and payment of damages could be substantial. The Company’s reputation could also be adversely affected by such claims, whether or not successful.\nThere can be no assurance that the Company will be able to continue to successfully avoid, manage and defend such matters. In addition, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures, actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the Company’s estimates for such contingent liabilities.\nThe Company’s products could be recalled.\nThe Company maintains an awareness of and responsibility for the potential health and safety impacts on its customers. The Company's product development processes include tollgates for product safety review, and extensive testing is conducted on product safety. Safety reviews are performed at various product development milestones, including a review of product labeling and marking to ensure safety and operational hazards are identified for the customer.\nDespite safety and quality reviews, the Consumer Product Safety Commission or other applicable regulatory bodies may require, or the Company may voluntarily institute, the recall, repair or replacement of the Company’s products if those products are found not to be in compliance with applicable standards or regulations. A recall could increase the Company's costs and adversely impact its reputation.\nThe Company’s sales to government customers exposes it to business volatility and risks, including government budgeting cycles and appropriations, procurement regulations, governmental policy shifts, early termination of contracts, audits, investigations, sanctions and penalties.\nThe Company derives a portion of its revenues from contracts with the U.S. government, state and local governments and foreign governments. Government contractors must comply with specific procurement regulations and other requirements. These requirements, although customary in government contracts, could impact the Company’s performance and compliance costs, including limiting or delaying the Company’s ability to share information with its business partners, customers and investors, which may negatively impact the Company’s business and reputation.\nThe U.S. government may demand contract terms that are less favorable than standard arrangements with private sector customers and may have statutory, contractual or other legal rights to terminate contracts with the Company. For example, the U.S. government may have contract clauses that permit it to terminate any of the Company’s government contracts and subcontracts at its convenience, and procurement regulations permit termination for default based on the Company’s performance. In addition, changes in U.S. government budgetary priorities could lead to changes in the procurement environment, affecting availability of government contracting or funding opportunities. Changes in government procurement policy, priorities, regulations, technology initiatives and requirements, and/or contract award criteria may negatively impact the Company’s potential for growth in the government sector. Changes in government cybersecurity and system requirements could negatively impact the Company’s eligibility for the award of future contracts, negatively impacting the Company’s business and reputation.\nGovernment contracts laws and regulations impose certain risks, and contracts are generally subject to audits, investigations and approval of policies, procedures and internal controls for compliance with procurement regulations and applicable law. If violations of law are found, they could result in civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, refund of a portion of fees received, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines and suspensions or debarment from future government business. Each of these factors could negatively impact the Company’s business, results of operations, financial condition, and reputation.\nOther Risks\nThe Company’s results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations.\nThe Company’s results of operations and earnings may not meet guidance or expectations. The Company may provide public guidance on expected results of operations for future periods. This guidance is comprised of forward-looking statements subject to risks and uncertainties, including the risks and uncertainties described in this Form 10-K and in the Company’s other public filings and public statements, and is based necessarily on assumptions the Company makes at the time it provides such guidance. The Company’s guidance may not always be accurate. The Company may also choose to withdraw guidan\nc\ne, as it did in response to the uncertainty of the COVID-19 pandemic, or lower guidance in future periods. If, in the future, the Company’s results of operations for a particular period do not meet its guidance or the expectations of investment analysts, the Company\n23\nreduces its guidance for future periods, or the Company withdraws guidance, the market price of the Company’s common stock could decline significantly.\nThe Company has identified material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting. If not remediated, the Company’s failure to establish and maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting could result in material misstatements in its financial statements and a failure to meet its reporting and financial obligations, each of which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s financial condition and the trading price of its common stock.\nSubsequent to the filing of its 2020 Form 10-K, the Company received comments from the SEC Staff regarding its accounting for equity units issued in May 2017 and November 2019 (the “Equity Units”). Upon further reflection of the comments received by the Staff and the nature of the Equity Units, the Company determined that errors were made in its original accounting conclusions resulting from material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting for such instruments. A material weakness is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nAs discussed in I\ntem 9A. Controls and Procedures\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K, the Company’s management has evaluated its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting and its disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that they were not effective as of January 1, 2022.\nThe Company is committed to remediating its material weaknesses as promptly as possible. Management is in the process of implementing its remediation plan. However, there can be no assurance as to when the material weaknesses will be remediated or that additional material weaknesses will not arise in the future. If the Company is unable to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting, its ability to record, process and report financial information timely and accurately could be adversely affected, which could subject the Company to litigation or investigations, require management resources, increase costs, negatively affect investor confidence and adversely impact its stock price."

The Company has voluntarily disclosed this information to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") and is cooperating with the SEC’s investigation of this matter.\nFor the named executive officers in fiscal year 2021, the Company has calculated the amount of the undisclosed perquisites to be up to approximately $225,000 in 2020 and up to approximately $350,000 in 2019.  These amounts relate principally to use of corporate aircraft and will be included in the Company’s proxy statement for its 2022 annual shareholders meeting.\n24\nThe Company is committed to upholding the highest standards of corporate governance and is continuously focused on ensuring the effectiveness of its policies, procedures, and controls.  The Company is in the process, with the assistance of professional advisors, of reviewing and further enhancing relevant policies, procedures, and controls.\nCurrently the Company does not believe that this matter will have a material impact on its financial condition or results of operations, although it is possible that a loss related to this matter may be incurred.  Given the ongoing nature of this matter, management cannot predict the duration, scope, or outcome of the SEC’s investigation or estimate the potential magnitude of any such loss or range of loss, or the cost of the ongoing SEC investigation.  Any determination that the Company’s expense and perquisite reporting practices were not in compliance with existing laws or regulations could result in the imposition of fines, civil or criminal penalties, equitable remedies, including disgorgement, injunctive relief, or other sanctions against the Company.  The Company also may become a party to litigation or other legal proceedings over these matters.\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is involved in various lawsuits and claims, including product liability, environmental, intellectual property, contract and commercial, advertising, employment and distributor claims, and administrative proceedings. The Company does not expect that the resolution of these matters will have a materially adverse effect on the Company’s consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity."

(“NYSE”) under the abbreviated ticker symbol “SWK”, and is a component of the Standard & Poor’s (“S&P”) 500 Composite Stock Price Index. The Company’s high and low quarterly stock prices on the NYSE for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 follow:\nAs of February 4, 2022, there were 8,755 holders of record of the Company’s common stock. Information required by Item 201(d) of Regulation S-K concerning securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans can be found under Item 12 of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nIssuer Purchases of Equity Securities\nThe following table provides information about the Company’s purchases of equity securities that are registered by the Company pursuant to Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for the three months ended January 1, 2022:\n(a)\nThe shares of common stock in this column were deemed surrendered to the Company by participants in various benefit plans of the Company to satisfy the participants’ taxes related to vesting or delivery of time-vesting restricted share units under those plans.\n(b)\nOn April 23, 2021, the Board of Directors approved a new repurchase program of up to 20.0 million shares of the Company's common stock (the \"April 2021 Program\") and terminated the previously approved repurchase program. As of January 1, 2022, the authorized shares available for repurchase under April 2021 Program totaled 20.0 million shares. On February 16, 2022, the Board of Directors terminated the April 2021 Program and approved a new repurchase program of up to the greater of (i) 20.0 million shares of the Company’s common stock; and (ii) the number of shares of the Company’s common stock in the aggregate that can be purchased for an amount up to $2.5 billion. As of February 16, 2022, the authorized shares available for purchase under the new program totaled the greater of (i) 20.0 million shares; and (ii) the number of shares in the aggregate that can be purchased for an amount up to $2.5 billion. The new repurchase program does not have an expiration date. The Company may repurchase shares under the repurchase program through open market purchases, privately negotiated transactions or share repurchase programs, including one or more accelerated share repurchase programs (under which an initial payment for the entire repurchase amount may be made at the inception of the program).  Such repurchases may be funded from cash on hand, short-term borrowings or other sources of cash at the Company’s discretion, and the Company is under no obligation to repurchase any shares pursuant to the repurchase program.

All references to “\nNotes\n” in this\nItem 7\nrefer to the\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in\nItem 8\nof this Annual Report.\nThe following discussion and certain other sections of this Annual Report on Form 10-K contain statements reflecting the Company’s views about its future performance that constitute “forward-looking statements” under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about the industry and markets in which the Company operates as well as management’s beliefs and assumptions. Any statements contained herein (including without limitation statements to the effect that Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. or its management “believes,” “expects,” “anticipates,” “plans” and similar expressions) that are not statements of historical fact should be considered forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. There are a number of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by such forward-looking statements. These factors include, without limitation, those set forth, or incorporated by reference, below under the heading “Cautionary Statements Under The Private Securities Litigation Reform Act Of 1995.” The Company does not intend to update publicly any forward-looking statements whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise.\nStrategic Objectives\nThe Company continues to pursue a growth and acquisition strategy, which involves industry, geographic and customer diversification to foster sustainable revenue, earnings and cash flow growth, and employ the following strategic framework in pursuit of its vision to deliver top-quartile financial performance, become known as one of the world’s leading innovators and elevate its commitment to ESG:\n•\nContinue organic growth momentum by leveraging the SBD Operating Model to drive innovation and commercial excellence, while diversifying toward higher-growth, higher-margin businesses;\n•\nBe selective and operate in markets where brand is meaningful, the value proposition is definable and sustainable through innovation, and global cost leadership is achievable; and\n•\nPursue acquisitive growth on multiple fronts by building upon its existing global tools platform and expanding the outdoor products category, expanding the Industrial platform in Engineered Fastening and Infrastructure, and pursuing adjacencies with sound industrial logic.\nExecution of the above strategy has resulted in approximately $13.5 billion of acquisitions since 2002 (excluding the Black & Decker merger), several divestitures, improved efficiency in the supply chain and manufacturing operations, and enhanced investments in organic growth, enabled by cash flow generation and increased debt capacity. In addition, the Company's continued focus on diversification and organic growth has resulted in improved financial results and an increase in its global presence. The Company also remains focused on leveraging its SBD Operating Model to deliver success in the 2020s and beyond. The latest evolution of the SBD Operating Model builds on the strength of the Company's past while embracing changes in the external environment to ensure the Company has the right skillsets, incorporates technology advances in all areas, maintains operational excellence, drives efficiency in business processes and resiliency into its culture, delivers extreme innovation and ensures the customer experience is world class. The operating model underpins the Company's ability to deliver above-market organic growth with margin expansion, maintain efficient levels of selling, general and administrative expenses (\"SG&A\") and deliver top-quartile asset efficiency.\nThe Company’s long-term financial objectives remain as follows:\n28\n•\n4-6% organic revenue growth;\n•\n10-12% total revenue growth;\n•\n10-12% total EPS growth (7-9% organically) excluding acquisition-related charges;\n•\nFree cash flow equal to, or exceeding, net income;\n•\nDeliver 10+ working capital turns; and\n•\nCash Flow Return On Investment (\"CFROI\") between 12-15%.\nIn terms of capital allocation, the Company remains committed, over time, to returning approximately 50% of excess capital to shareholders through a strong and growing dividend as well as opportunistically repurchasing shares. The remaining capital (approximately 50%) will be deployed towards acquisitions.\nPending Sale of Convergent Security Solutions (\"CSS\")\nIn December 2021, the Company announced that it had reached a definitive agreement for the sale of most of its Security assets to Securitas AB for $3.2 billion in cash. The proposed transaction includes the Company's CSS business comprising of commercial electronic security and healthcare businesses. The transaction does not include the Company's automatic doors business. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first half of 2022. Net proceeds from the sale are expected to be used to fund, in part, an approximately $4 billion share repurchase which is planned to be completed in 2022. The use of net proceeds towards a planned share repurchase program is consistent with the Company's long-term capital allocation strategy focused on value maximization.\nAcquisitions and Investments\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 80 percent ownership stake in MTD Holdings Inc. (\"MTD\"), a privately held global manufacturer of outdoor power equipment. The Company previously acquired a 20 percent interest in MTD in January 2019. With over $2.6 billion of revenue in 2021, MTD designs, manufactures and distributes lawn tractors, zero turn ride on mowers, walk behind mowers, snow blowers, residential robotic mowers, handheld outdoor power equipment and garden tools for both residential and professional consumers under well-known brands like Cub Cadet® and Troy-Bilt®.\nOn November 12, 2021, the Company acquired Excel Industries (\"Excel\"). Excel is a leading designer and manufacturer of premium commercial and residential turf-care equipment under the brands of Hustler Turf Equipment® and BigDog Mower Co®. The Company believes this is a strategically important bolt-on acquisition that bolsters the presence in the independent dealer network.\nThe Company expects the combination of MTD, Excel and its existing outdoor strategic business unit in Tools & Storage will create a global leader in the $25 billion and growing outdoor category, with strong brands and growth opportunities. As part of the integration of these businesses, the Company plans to design, develop and manufacture battery and electric-powered solutions for professional and residential users.  This will position the combined businesses to be a leader as preferences shift from gas powered equipment toward electrified solutions in outdoor power equipment.\nOn February 24, 2020, the Company acquired Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing, LLC (\"CAM\"), an industry-leading manufacturer of specialty fasteners and components for the aerospace and defense markets. The acquisition further diversified the Company's presence in the industrial markets and expanded its portfolio of specialty fasteners in the aerospace and defense markets.\nOn March 8, 2019, the Company acquired the International Equipment Solutions Attachments businesses, Paladin and Pengo, (\"IES Attachments\"), manufacturers of high quality, performance-driven heavy equipment attachment tools for off-highway applications.  The acquisition further diversified the Company's presence in the industrial markets, expanded its portfolio of attachment solutions and provided a meaningful platform for growth.\nRefer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments,\nfor further discussion.\nDivestitures\nOn May 30, 2019, the Company sold its Sargent and Greenleaf mechanical locks business within the Security segment. The Company has also divested several smaller businesses in recent years that did not fit into its long-term strategic objectives. These divestitures allow the Company to invest in other areas of the Company that fit into its long-term growth strategy.\nRefer to\nNote T, Divestitures,\nfor further discussion of the Company's divestitures.\nCOVID-19 Pandemic\n29\nThe novel coronavirus (\"COVID-19\") outbreak has adversely affected the Company's workforce and operations, as well as the operations of its customers, distributors, suppliers and contractors. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in significant volatility and uncertainty in the markets in which the Company operates. To successfully navigate through this unprecedented period, the Company has remained focused on the following key priorities:\n•\nEnsuring the health and safety of its employees and supply chain partners;\n•\nMaintaining business continuity and financial strength and stability;\n•\nServing its customers as they provide essential products and services to the world; and\n•\nDoing its part to mitigate the impact of the virus across the globe.\nTo respond to the volatile and uncertain environment, the Company implemented a comprehensive cost reduction and efficiency program in 2020, which delivered approximately $625 million of net savings across 2021 and 2020. Cost actions executed under the program included headcount reductions, furloughs, reduced employee work schedules, a voluntary retirement program, and footprint rationalizations. The Company took steps in 2020 to make some of the cost actions permanent while certain employees were returned to full-time status. This ensured the sustainability of the cost reduction program into 2021 while providing more employment stability for the Company's remaining associates.\nDriving Further Profitable Growth by Fully Leveraging The Company's Core Franchises\nEach of the Company's franchises share common attributes: they have world-class brands and attractive growth characteristics, they are scalable and defensible, they can differentiate through innovation, and they are powered by the SBD Operating Model.\n•\nThe Tools & Storage business is the tool company to own, with strong brands, proven innovation, global scale, and a broad offering of power tools, hand tools, outdoor products, accessories, and storage & digital products across many channels in both developed and developing markets.\n•\nThe Engineered Fastening business is a highly profitable, GDP+ growth business offering highly engineered, value-added innovative solutions with recurring revenue attributes and global scale.\nWhile diversifying the business portfolio through strategic acquisitions remains important, management recognizes that the core franchises described above are important foundations that continue to provide strong cash flow and growth prospects. Management is committed to growing these businesses through innovative product development, brand support, continued investment in emerging markets and a sharp focus on global cost competitiveness.\nContinuing to Invest in the Stanley Black & Decker Brands\nThe Company has a strong portfolio of brands associated with high-quality products including STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER®, DEWALT®, FLEXVOLT®, IRWIN®, LENOX®, CRAFTSMAN®, PORTER-CABLE®, BOSTITCH®, PROTO®, MAC TOOLS®, FACOM®, Powers®, LISTA®, Vidmar®, GQ® and through the 2021 acquisitions of MTD and Excel added Cub Cadet®, Troy-Bilt® and Hustler® in the Americas. Among the Company's most valuable assets, STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER® and DEWALT® are recognized as three of the world's great brands, while CRAFTSMAN® is recognized as a premier American brand.\nThe National Collegiate Athletic Association sponsorship delivered an estimated 308+ million views through TV-visible DEWALT® branding at 25 colleges and universities across five (Atlantic Coast Conference, Big Ten, Big 12, Pac-12 and Mountain West) Division 1 conferences.\nDuring 2021, the Company also announced its “Official Tools” sponsorship with McLaren Racing in Formula 1 – a partnership well on track for 2022. In 2021, the McLaren team sported the DEWALT® logo on the car for 16 races starting at the British Grand Prix in July.\nThe STANLEY®, DEWALT® and CRAFTSMAN® brands continue to have prominent signage in Major League Baseball (\"MLB\") stadiums appearing in many MLB games. The Company has also maintained long-standing NASCAR and NHRA racing sponsorships, which provided brand exposure during nearly 60 events in 2021 with the STANLEY®, DEWALT®, CRAFTSMAN®, IRWIN® and MAC TOOLS® brands. The Company also advertises in the English Premier League, which is the number one soccer league in the world, featuring STANLEY®, BLACK+DECKER® and DEWALT® brands to a global audience. In 2014, the Company became a sponsor for one of the world’s most popular football clubs, FC Barcelona (\"FCB\"), including player image rights, hospitality assets and stadium signage. In 2018, the Company was announced as the first ever shirt sponsor for the FCB Women's team in support of its commitment to global diversity and inclusion.\n30\nThe above marketing initiatives highlight the Company's strong emphasis on brand building and commercial support, which has resulted in more than 300 billion global brand impressions – an annual increase of 110% – from digital and traditional advertising and strong brand awareness. Allocating brand and advertising spend judiciously will continue to be the Company’s focus. Among the goals: being front and center in an emerging digital landscape, evolving proven marketing programs that tie trusted global brands with societal purpose and tapping into technologies to build meaning 1:1 experiences with customers, consumers, employees and shareholders in line with the Company’s mission and vision.\nThe SBD Operating Model: Winning in the 2020s\nOver the past 15 years, the Company has successfully leveraged its proven and continually evolving operating model to focus the organization to sustain top-quartile performance, resulting in asset efficiency, above-market organic growth and expanding operating margins. In its first evolution, the Stanley Fulfillment System (\"SFS\") focused on streamlining operations, which helped reduce lead times, realize synergies during acquisition integrations, and mitigate material and energy price inflation. In 2015, the Company launched a refreshed and revitalized SFS operating system, entitled SFS 2.0, to drive from a more programmatic growth mentality to a true organic growth culture by more deeply embedding breakthrough innovation and commercial excellence into its businesses, and at the same time, becoming a significantly more digitally-enabled enterprise. The latest evolution occurred in 2020, when the Company launched the SBD Operating Model: Winning in the 2020s, which recognized the changing dynamics of the world in which the Company operates, including the acceleration of technological change, geopolitical instability and the changing nature of work.\nAt the center of the model is the concept of the interrelationship between people and technology. The remaining four categories are: Performance Resiliency; Extreme Innovation; Operations Excellence and Extraordinary Customer Experience. Each of these elements co-exists synergistically with the others in a systems-based approach.\nPeople and Technology\nThis pillar emphasizes the Company's belief that the right combination of digitally proficient people applying technology such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, advanced analytics, Internet of Things and others in focused ways can be an enormous source of value creation and sustainability for the Company. It also brings to light the changing nature of work and the talent and skillsets required for individuals and institutions to thrive in the future. With technology infiltrating the workplace at an increasingly rapid pace, the Company believes that the winners in the 2020s will invest heavily in reskilling, upskilling and lifelong learning with an emphasis on the places where people and technology intersect. In other words, technology can make humans more powerful and productive if, and only if, humans know how to apply the technology to maximum advantage. The Company has created plans and programs, as well as a new leadership model to ensure people have the right skills, tools and mindsets to thrive in this era. The ability for employees to embrace technology, learn and relearn new skills and take advantage of the opportunities presented in this new world will be critical to the Company's success.\nPerformance Resiliency\nThe Company views performance resiliency as the agility, flexibility and adaptability to sustain strong performance in a variety of operating environment conditions, which requires planning for the unexpected and anticipating exogenous volatility as the new normal. Technology, applied to key business processes, products and business models, will be a key enabler for value creation and performance resiliency as the Company executes sustainable, ongoing transformation across the enterprise.\nExtreme Innovation\nThe Company has a historically strong foundation in innovation, launching more than 1,000 products a year, including breakthroughs such as D\nE\nWALT Flexvolt, Atomic, Xtreme, and the launch of D\nE\nWALT PowerStack in December 2021. In recent years, the Company has expanded its innovation-focused internal teams and external partnerships, but now it is growing that innovation ecosystem at a rapid pace, expanding the number of external collaborations with start-ups and entrepreneurs, academic institutions, research labs and others. This innovation culture, which includes a focus on social impact in addition to the Company's traditional product and customer focus, enables the Company to introduce products to market faster and reimagine how to operate in today’s technology-enabled, fast-paced world.\nOperations Excellence\nAn intense focus on operations excellence and asset efficiency is mandatory in a dynamic world in which the bar for competitiveness is always moving higher. To help maintain the Company's edge, a much more agile, adaptable and technology-enabled supply chain is necessary to manufacture closer to its customers. This “Make Where We Sell” strategy will improve customer responsiveness, lower lead times, reduce costs and mitigate geopolitical and currency risk while facilitating improvements in carbon footprint.\nExtraordinary Customer Experience\n31\nCustomers are increasingly demanding world-class experiences from their brands and expectations for execution at the customer level are growing every day. It is no longer sufficient to have great products on the shelf or in the catalog. The Company knows that to sustain market share growth, it needs to evolve and adapt to provide the types of experiences that customers now expect. Each of the Company's businesses evaluates and works to systematically improve its various customer journeys and acts on customer insights to continuously deliver an extraordinary customer experience. As previously noted, the interaction between people and technology will define success in this area.\nLeveraging the SBD Operating Model, the Company is building a culture in which it strives to become known as one of the world’s great innovative companies by embracing the current environment of rapid innovation and digital transformation. The Company continues to build a vast innovation focused ecosystem to pursue faster innovation and to remain aware of and open to new technologies and advances by leveraging both internal initiatives and external partnerships. The innovation ecosystem used in concert with the SBD Operating Model is anticipated to allow the Company to apply innovation to its core processes in manufacturing and back office functions to reduce operating costs and inefficiencies, develop core and breakthrough product innovations within each of its businesses, and pursue disruptive business models to either push into new markets or change existing business models before competition or new market entrants capture the opportunity. The Company continues to make progress towards this vision, as evidenced by the creation of Innovation Everywhere, a program that encourages and empowers all employees to implement value creation and cost savings using collaborative and innovative solutions, breakthrough innovation teams, the Stanley Ventures group, which invests capital in new and emerging start-ups in core focus areas, the Techstars partnership, which selects start-ups from around the world with the goal of bringing breakthrough technologies to market, the Manufactory 4.0, which is the Company's epicenter for Industry 4.0 technology development and partnership, and STANLEY X, a Silicon Valley based team, which is building its own set of disruptive initiatives and exploring new business models.\nThe Company has made a significant commitment to the SBD Operating Model and management believes that its success will be characterized by continued asset efficiency, organic growth in the 4-6% range in the long-term as well as expanded operating margin rates over the next 3 to 5 years as the Company leverages the growth and pursues structural cost reductions with the margin resiliency initiatives.\nThe Company believes that the SBD Operating Model will serve as a powerful value driver in the years ahead, ensuring the Company is positioned to win in the 2020s by developing and obtaining the right people and technology to deliver performance resiliency, extreme innovation, operations excellence and an extraordinary customer experience. The operating model, in concert with the Company's innovation ecosystem, will enable the Company to change as rapidly as the external environment which directly supports achievement of the Company's long-term financial objectives, including its vision, and further enables its shareholder-friendly capital allocation approach, which has served the Company well in the past and will continue to do so in the future.\nSegments\nThe Company’s operations are classified into two reportable business segments: Tools & Storage and Industrial. The Company has one non-reportable business operating segment, Mechanical Access Solutions (\"MAS\").\nTools & Storage\nThe Tools & Storage segment is comprised of the Power Tools Group (\"PTG\"), Hand Tools, Accessories & Storage (\"HTAS\"), and Outdoor Power Equipment (\"Outdoor\") businesses.\nThe PTG business includes both professional and consumer products.

The operating results of these businesses previously were included in the Security segment and have been classified as discontinued operations.\nCertain Items Impacting Earnings\nThe Company has provided a discussion of its results both inclusive and exclusive of acquisition-related and other charges. Organic growth is also utilized to describe results aside from the impacts of foreign currency fluctuations, acquisitions during their initial 12 months of ownership, and divestitures. The results and measures, including gross profit, selling, general, and administrative (\"SG&A\"), Other, net, and segment profit, on a basis excluding acquisition-related and other charges, and organic growth are Non-GAAP financial measures. The Company considers the use of Non-GAAP financial measures relevant to aid analysis and understanding of the Company’s results and business trends aside from the material impact of these items and ensures appropriate comparability to operating results of prior periods.\nThe Company’s operating results at the consolidated level as discussed below include and exclude acquisition-related and other charges impacting gross profit, SG&A, and Other, net. The Company’s business segment results as discussed below include and exclude acquisition-related and other charges impacting gross profit and SG&A.

Tools & Storage net sales increased 24% compared to 2020 due to a 17% increase in volume, a 3% increase in price and 2% increases from both acquisitions and foreign currency. Industrial net sales increased 5% compared to 2020 primarily due to a 2% increase in volume, a 1% increase in price, and 1% increases from both acquisitions and foreign currency.\nNet sales were $13.058 billion in 2020 compared to $12.913 billion in 2019, representing an increase of 1% driven by a 2% increase from acquisitions, primarily CAM, and a 1% increase in price, partially offset by pandemic-related volume decreases of 1% and foreign currency of 1%. Organic growth of 12% in the second half of 2020 and acquisitions more than offset first half pandemic related market impacts. Tools & Storage net sales increased 3% compared to 2019 due to 2% increases in both volume and price, partially offset by a decrease of 1% from foreign currency. Industrial net sales decreased 3% compared to 2019 primarily due to volume decreases of 15%, partially offset by acquisition growth of 12%.\nGross Profit:\nThe Company reported gross profit of $5.194 billion, or 33.3% of net sales, in 2021 compared to $4.405 billion, or 33.7% of net sales, in 2020. Acquisition-related and other charges, which reduced gross profit, were $39.0 million in 2021\n35\nand $61.7 million in 2020. Excluding these charges, gross profit was 33.5% of net sales in 2021 compared to 34.2% in 2020, as higher volume, productivity, price realization, and mix benefits from innovation were more than offset primarily by commodity inflation and higher supply chain costs to serve demand.\nThe Company reported gross profit of $4.405 billion, or 33.7% of net sales, in 2020 compared to $4.233 billion, or 32.8% of net sales, in 2019. Acquisition-related and other charges, which reduced gross profit, were $61.7 million in 2020 and $28.0 million in 2019. Excluding these charges, gross profit was 34.2% of net sales in 2020, compared to 33.0% in 2019, driven by productivity, margin resiliency initiatives and price realization.\nSG&A Expenses:\nSelling, general and administrative expenses, inclusive of the provision for credit losses (“SG&A”), were $3.240 billion, or 20.7% of net sales, in 2021 compared to $2.629 billion, or 20.1% of net sales, in 2020. Within SG&A, acquisition-related and other charges totaled $184.5 million in 2021 and $123.2 million in 2020. Excluding these charges, SG&A was 19.6% of net sales in 2021 compared to 19.2% in 2020, reflecting growth investments deployed across the businesses.\nSG&A expenses were $2.629 billion, or 20.1% of net sales, in 2020 compared to $2.568 billion, or 19.9% of net sales, in 2019. Within SG&A, acquisition-related and other charges totaled $123.2 million in 2020 and $71.2 million in 2019. Excluding these charges, SG&A was 19.2% of net sales in 2020 compared to 19.3% in 2019, primarily reflecting the benefits of cost management programs implemented in response to the global pandemic, partially offset by growth investments to pursue market recoveries and opportunities across the businesses that emerged during the pandemic.\nDistribution center costs (i.e. warehousing and fulfillment facility and associated labor costs) are classified within SG&A. This classification may differ from other companies who may report such expenses within cost of sales. Due to diversity in practice, to the extent the classification of these distribution costs differs from other companies, the Company’s gross margins may not be comparable. Such distribution costs classified in SG&A amounted to $416.5 million, $347.3 million and $326.5 million in  in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther, net:\nOther, net totaled $190.1 million, $217.8 million, and $201.1 million in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

The year-over-year decrease in 2021 was primarily due to appreciation of Stanley Ventures' investments. The year-over-year increase in 2020 driven by higher intangible asset amortization and negative impacts from foreign currency.\nLoss (gain) on Sales of Businesses:\nDuring 2021, the Company reported a $0.6 million net loss on divestitures. During 2020, the Company reported a $13.5 million net loss primarily relating to the sale of a product line within Oil & Gas. During 2019, the Company reported a $17.0 million gain relating to the sale of the Sargent and Greenleaf business.\nGain on equity method investment:\nUpon the acquisition of MTD in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company recognized a $68.0 million gain on its previously held equity method investment. Refer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments\n, for further discussion.\nLoss on Debt Extinguishments:\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company extinguished $1.154 billion of its notes payable and recognized a $46.9 million pre-tax loss\nprimarily due to a make-whole premium payment\n. In 2019, the Company extinguished $750 million of its notes payable and recognized a $17.9 million pre-tax loss\nprimarily related to the write-off of deferred financing fees.\nInterest, net:\nNet interest expense in 2021 was $175.6 million compared to $205.1 million in 2020 and $230.3 million in 2019. The decrease in 2021 compared to 2020 was primarily driven by lower U.S. interest rates on commercial paper borrowings and lower interest expense related to the extinguishment of notes payable in the fourth quarter of 2020, partially offset by lower interest income due to a decline in rates. The decrease in net interest expense in 2020 versus 2019 was primarily driven by lower U.S. interest rates and lower average balances relating to the Company's commercial paper borrowings, partially offset by lower interest income due to a decline in rates.\nIncome Taxes\n: On March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARPA”) was enacted. The ARPA, among other things, includes provisions to expand the IRC Section 162(m) disallowance for deduction of certain compensation paid by publicly held corporations, provide a 100% COBRA subsidy, temporarily increase the income exclusion for dependent care assistance, and to extend and modify the employee retention credit and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act paid leave credit. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer social\n36\nsecurity payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The Company completed its evaluation of the ARPA and CARES Act, and concluded that they did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company's effective tax rate on continuing operations was 3.7% in 2021, 3.5% in 2020, and 11.6% in 2019.  Excluding the impact of  acquisition-related and other charges, the effective tax rate in 2021 on continuing operations was 6.9%. This effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a benefit associated with the Company's supply chain reorganization, tax on foreign earnings, the remeasurement of uncertain tax position reserves, the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities due to foreign corporate income tax rate changes, and the tax benefit of equity-based compensation.\nExcluding the one-time tax benefit of $118.8 million recorded in the second quarter 2020 to reverse a deferred tax liability previously established related to certain unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries not permanently reinvested as a result of initiating a supply chain reorganization and the impact of acquisition-related and other charges, the effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2020 was 15.2%. This effective tax rate differs from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to tax on foreign earnings at tax rates different than the U.S. rate, the remeasurement of uncertain tax position reserves, the tax benefit of equity compensation, and tax benefits arising from an increase in deferred tax assets associated with the Company’s supply chain reorganization and partial realignment of the Company's legal structure.\nExcluding the impact of acquisition-related and other charges, the effective tax rate on continuing operations in 2019 was 13.3%. This effective tax rate differed from the U.S. statutory tax rate primarily due to a portion of the Company's earnings being realized in lower-taxed foreign jurisdictions and the favorable effective settlements of income tax audits.\nBusiness Segment Results\nThe Company’s reportable segments are aggregations of businesses that have similar products, services and end markets, among other factors. The Company utilizes segment profit which is defined as net sales minus cost of sales and SG&A inclusive of the provision for credit losses (aside from corporate overhead expense), and segment profit as a percentage of net sales to assess the profitability of each segment.\nThe Company’s operations are classified into two reportable business segments: Tools & Storage and Industrial.\nTools & Storage:\nTools & Storage net sales increased $2.488 billion, or 24%, in 2021 compared to 2020 due to a 17% increase in volume, a 3% increase in price and 2% increases from both acquisitions and favorable currency. The 20% organic growth was driven by stronger volumes due to the consumer reconnection with the home and garden, eCommerce and strong professional demand as well as price.\nSegment profit amounted to $1.985 billion, or 15.5% of net sales, in 2021 compared to $1.820 billion, or 17.6% of net sales, in 2020. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $178.4 million and $46.4 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, segment profit amounted to 16.9% of net sales in 2021 compared to 18.1% in 2020, as volume and price benefits were more than offset by inflation, higher pandemic-related supply chain costs and growth investments.\nTools & Storage net sales increased $267.6 million, or 3%, in 2020 compared to 2019 due to a 2% increase in both volume and price, partially offset by unfavorable currency of 1%. The 4% organic growth was driven by a strong second half organic performance of 18% from a consumer reconnection with the home and garden and a shift to eCommerce that emerged from the pandemic and was accelerated by a robust lineup of new and innovative products. Double digit growth was realized across all regions in the second half of 2020. For the full year, North America and Europe organic growth more than offset a decline in emerging markets.\nSegment profit amounted to $1.820 billion, or 17.6% of net sales, in 2020 compared to $1.517 billion, or 15.1% of net sales, in 2019. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $46.4 million and $44.3 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, segment profit amounted to 18.1% of net sales in 2020 compared to 15.5% in 2019, as volume, productivity, cost control and price were partially offset by new growth investments, tariffs and currency.\n37\nIndustrial:\nIndustrial net sales increased $110.4 million, or 5%, in 2021 compared to 2020, due to a 2% increase in volume, a 1% increase in price, and 1% increases from both acquisitions and foreign currency. Engineered Fastening organic revenues increased 5% for the full year, as general industrial growth and a strong first half in automotive more than offset the market-driven aerospace declines. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 1% as mid-teen growth in Attachment Tools was more than offset by lower pipeline activity in Oil & Gas.\nSegment profit totaled $256.6 million, or 10.4% of net sales, in 2021 compared to $220.6 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2020. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $13.1 million and $67.1 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, segment profit amounted to 10.9% of net sales in 2021 compared to 12.2% in 2020, as volume, price and productivity was more than offset by commodity inflation, growth investments and unfavorable mix.\nIndustrial net sales decreased $82.0 million, or 3%, in 2020 compared to 2019, due to pandemic-related market declines in volume of 15%, partially offset by acquisition growth of 12%. Engineered Fastening organic revenues decreased 15% for the full year, due to the significant impacts from the pandemic to automotive and general industrial production. Infrastructure organic revenues were down 15% from lower volumes in Attachment Tools and a sharp decline in Oil & Gas pipeline construction. The deepest segment organic revenue decline was the second quarter and each quarter thereafter delivered stronger revenue as markets recovered.\nSegment profit totaled $220.6 million, or 9.4% of net sales, in 2020 compared to $330.0 million, or 13.6% of net sales, in 2019. Excluding acquisition-related and other charges of $67.1 million and $25.8 million in 2020 and 2019, respectively, segment profit amounted to 12.2% of net sales in 2020 compared to 14.6% in 2019, as productivity gains and cost control were more than offset by market driven volume declines.\nCorporate Overhead & Other\nCorporate Overhead & Other includes the results of the commercial electronic security business in five countries in Europe and emerging markets through its disposition in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the Mechanical Access Solutions business, a non-reportable business operating segment, as well as the corporate overhead element of SG&A, which is not allocated to the business segments. Corporate Overhead & Other amounted to $288.2 million, $264.0 million, and $181.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which includes $45.5 million, $33.7 million and $47.5 million of operating profit from the MAS business in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Excluding acquisition-related charges, Corporate Overhead & Other is $256.2 million, $192.6 million and $152.9 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The year-over-year increase in 2021 compared to 2020 was driven by functional investments. The year-over-year increase in 2020 compared to 2019 was driven by higher employee-related costs.\n38\nRESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES\nA summary of the restructuring reserve activity from January 2, 2021 to January 1, 2022 is as follows:\nDuring 2021, the Company recognized net restructuring charges of $14.5 million, primarily related to facility closures and asset impairments. The Company expects to achieve annual net cost savings of approximately $24 million by the end of 2022 related to restructuring costs incurred during 2021. The majority of the $31.9 million of reserves remaining as of January 1, 2022 is expected to be utilized within the next twelve months.\nDuring 2020, the Company recognized net restructuring charges of $73.8 million, primarily related to severance costs associated with a cost reduction program announced in the second quarter of 2020. The 2020 actions resulted in net cost savings of approximately $125 million in 2021.\nDuring 2019, the Company recognized net restructuring charges of $138.4 million, primarily related to severance costs associated with a cost reduction program announced in the third quarter of 2019. The 2019 actions resulted in annual net cost savings of approximately $185 million, primarily in the Tools & Storage segment.\nSegments:\nThe $15 million of net restructuring charges in 2021 includes: $8 million pertaining to the Tools & Storage segment; $2 million pertaining to the Industrial segment; and $5 million pertaining to Corporate.\nThe anticipated annual net cost savings of approximately $24 million related to the 2021 restructuring actions include: $13 million in the Tools & Storage segment; $10 million in the Industrial segment; and $1 million in Corporate.\n2022 OUTLOOK\nThis outlook discussion is intended to provide broad insight into the Company’s near-term earnings and cash flow generation prospects. The Company expects 2022 diluted earnings per share to approximate $10.10 to $10.70 ($12.00 to $12.50 excluding acquisition-related and other charges) reflecting year-over-year adjusted EPS growth of 15% to 19%. Free cash flow is expected to approximate $2.0 billion as the Company focuses on serving its customers while leveraging the SBD Operating Model to drive working capital efficiency. The 2022 outlook for adjusted diluted earnings per share assumes approximately $1.20 to $1.30 of accretion related to 6% to 7% price increases to exceed carryover headwinds, approximately $0.20 of dilution related to carryover growth investments, net of cost containment, approximately $0.60 accretion from Outdoor acquisitions, and approximately $0.10 of accretion from the impact of the 2022 share repurchase program, offsetting tax rate impacts and other below the line items.\nThe difference between 2022 diluted earnings per share outlook and the diluted earnings per share range, excluding charges, is $1.80 to $1.90, consisting of acquisition-related and other charges. These forecasted charges primarily relate to integration costs and cost reduction actions.\nFINANCIAL CONDITION\nLiquidity, Sources and Uses of Capital:\nThe Company’s primary sources of liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and available lines of credit under various credit facilities.\nOperating Activities:\nCash flows provided by operations were $663.1 million in 2021 compared to $2.022 billion in 2020. The year-over-year decrease was mainly attributable to higher inventory levels to meet demand within the Tools and Storage segment, coupled with longer lead times related to the challenged global supply chain.\nIn 2020, cash flows provided by operations were $2.022 billion compared to $1.506 billion in 2019. The year-over-year increase was mainly attributable to higher earnings driven by increased demand in the Tools & Storage segment and strong cost control.\nFree Cash Flow:\nFree cash flow, as defined in the table below, was $144.0 million in 2021 compared to $1.674 billion in 2020 and $1.081 billion in 2019. The decrease in free cash flow in 2021 was primarily due to a $1.8 billion increase in inventory,\n39\nexcluding acquisitions, to support the strong demand outlook and longer lead times related to the challenged global supply chain.  This included a substantial increase in inventory in transit of $600 million as well as higher unit costs associated with inflation. At least $500 million of this inventory increase is anticipated to reverse in 2022. Management considers free cash flow an important indicator of its liquidity, as well as its ability to fund future growth and provide dividends to shareowners, and is useful information for investors. Free cash flow does not include deductions for mandatory debt service, other borrowing activity, discretionary dividends on the Company’s common and preferred stock and business acquisitions, among other items.\nInvesting Activities:\nCash flows used in investing activities totaled $2.624 billion in 2021, driven by business acquisitions of $2.044 billion, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the MTD and Excel acquisitions, and capital and software expenditures of $519 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2020 totaled $1.577 billion, driven by business acquisitions of $1.324 billion, net of cash acquired, primarily related to the CAM acquisition, and capital and software expenditures of $348 million.\nCash flows used in investing activities in 2019 totaled $1.209 billion, driven by business acquisitions of $685 million, mainly related to IES Attachments, capital and software expenditures of $425 million and purchases of investments of $261 million, which mainly related to the 20 percent investment in MTD.\nFinancing Activities:\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $919 million in 2021 primarily driven by net short-term borrowings of $2.225 billion and $131 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock, partially offset by the redemption and conversion of preferred stock for $750 million, cash dividend payments on common stock of $475 million, and $75 million related to the termination of interest rate swaps.\nCash flows provided by financing activities totaled $616 million in 2020 primarily driven by net proceeds from debt issuances of $2.223 billion, proceeds generated from the remarketing of the Series C Preferred Stock of $750 million and $147 million of proceeds from issuances of common stock, partially offset by payments on long-term debt of $1.154 billion, cash dividend payments of $432 million, net repayments of short-term borrowings of $343 million under the Company's commercial paper program, and a $250 million Craftsman deferred purchase price payment.\nCash flows used in financing activities in 2019 totaled $293 million primarily driven by payments on long-term debt of $1.150 billion and cash dividend payments of $402 million, partially offset by $735 million in net proceeds from the issuance of equity units and net proceeds from debt issuances of $496 million.\nFluctuations in foreign currency rates negatively impacted cash by $62 million in 2021 and $1 million in 2019 due to the strengthening of the U.S. Dollar against other currencies. Fluctuations in foreign currency rates positively impacted cash by $23 million in 2020 due to the weakening of the U.S. dollar against other currencies.\nRefer to\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\n, and\nNote J, Capital Stock\n, for further discussion regarding the Company's debt and equity arrangements.\nCredit Ratings and Liquidity:\nThe Company maintains strong investment grade credit ratings from the major U.S. rating agencies on its senior unsecured debt (S&P A, Fitch A-, Moody's Baa1), as well as its commercial paper program (S&P A-1, Fitch F1, Moody's P-2). There were no changes to any of the Company's credit ratings during 2021, however, S&P and Fitch revised their outlooks to ‘stable’ from ‘negative’in the first half of 2021 as a result of the Company's strong performance during the COVID-19 pandemic. Refer to\nItem 1A. Risk Factors\nin\nPart I\nof this Form 10-K for further discussion of the risks associated with the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Failure to maintain strong investment grade rating levels could adversely affect the Company’s cost of funds, liquidity and access to capital markets, but would not have an adverse effect on the Company’s ability to access its existing committed credit facilities.\nCash and cash equivalents totaled $142 million and $1.242 billion as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively, which was primarily held in the U.S.\n40\nAs a result of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Act\"), the Company's tax liability related to the one-time transition tax associated with unremitted foreign earnings and profits totaled $296 million at January 1, 2022. The Act permits a U.S. company to elect to pay the net tax liability interest-free over a period of up to eight years. See the Contractual Obligations table below for the estimated amounts due by period. The Company has considered the implications of paying the required one-time transition tax, and believes it will not have a material impact on its liquidity.\nIn October 2021, the Company increased its commercial paper program from $3.0 billion to $3.5 billion, which includes Euro denominated borrowings in addition to U.S. Dollars. As of January 1, 2022, the Company had\n$2.2 billion of\nborrowings outstanding. As of January 2, 2021, the Company had no borrowings outstanding, Refer to\nNote I, Financial Instruments,\nfor further discussion.\nIn September 2021, the Company amended and restated its existing a five-year $2.0 billion committed credit facilit\ny with the concurrent execution of a new\nfive year $2.5 billion co\nmmitted credit facility (the \"5-year Credit Agreement\"). Borrowings under the 5-Year Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros or Pounds Sterling. A sub-limit amount of $814.3 million is designated for swing line advances which may be drawn in Euros pursuant to the terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the\nborrowing and specific terms of the 5-Year Credit Agreement. The Company must repay all advances under the 5-Year Credit Agreement by the earlier of September 8, 2026 or upon termination. The 5-Year Credit Agreement is designated to be a liquidity back-stop for the Company's $3.5 billion U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had not drawn on its five-year committed credit facility.\nIn September 2021, the Company terminated its 364-day $1.0 billion credit facility and concurrently executed a new 364-Day $1.0 billion committed credit facility (the \"364-Day Credit Agreement\"). Borrowings under the 364-Day Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars or Euros and bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing and pursuant to the terms of the 364-Day Credit Agreement. The Company must repay all advances under the 364-Day Credit Agreement by the earlier\nof September 7, 2022 or u\npon termination. The Company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first anniversary of the termination date provided that the Company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. The 364-Day Credit Agreement serves as part of the liquidity back-stop for the Compan\ny’s $3.5 billion U\n.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had not drawn on this 364-Day committed credit facility.\nIn November 2021, the Company executed a second 364-Day $1.0 billion committed credit facility (the \"Second 364-Day Credit Agreement\"). Borrowings under the Second 364-Day Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars and Euros and bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin determined at the time of the borrowing. The Company must repay all advances under the Second 364-Day Credit Agreement by the earlier of November 15, 2022 or upon termination. The Company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first anniversary of the termination date provided that the Company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. As of January 1, 2022, the Company had not drawn on this 364-Day committed credit facility.\nIn January 2022, the Company executed a third 364-Day $2.5 billion committed credit facility (the \"Third 364-Day Credit Agreement\"). Borrowings under the Third 364-Day Credit Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin determined at the time of the borrowing. The Company must repay all advances under the Third 364-Day Credit Agreement by the earlier of January 25, 2023 or upon termination. The Company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first anniversary of the termination date provided that the Company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. The Company has not drawn on this 364-Day committed credit facility.\nIn addition, the Company has other short-term lines of credit that are primarily uncommitted, with numerous banks, aggregating $354 million, of which approximately $263 million was available at January 1, 2022. Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal.\nAt January 1, 2022, the aggregate amount of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, long-term and short-term, was approximat\nely $4.9 billion. A\nt January 1, 2022, $2.2 billion was recorded as short-term borrowings. In addition, $91 million of the short-term credit lines was utilized primarily pertaining to outstanding letters of credit for which there are no required or reported debt balances. The weighted-average interest rates on U.S. dollar denominated short-term borrowings for 2021 and 2020 were 0.1% and 1.3%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rate on Euro denominated short-term borrowings for 2021 and 2020 were negative 0.5% and 0.2%, respectively.\n41\nIn the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company assumed $103.0 million and $4.3 million of debt in connection with the MTD and Excel acquisitions, respectively.\nIn November 2020, the Company issued $750.0 million of senior unsecured term notes maturing November 15, 2050 (\"2050 Term Notes\"). The 2050 Term Notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.75% per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears, and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured unsubordinated debt. The Company received total net proceeds from this offering of approximately $740 million, net of underwriting expenses and other fees associated with the transaction. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including repayment of other borrowings.\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the 2050 Term Notes, the Company redeemed the 3.4% senior unsecured term notes due 2021 (“2021 Term Notes”) and the 2.9% senior unsecured term notes due 2022 (“2022 Term Notes”) for approximately $1.2 billion representing the outstanding principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and a make-whole premium. The Company recognized a net pre-tax loss of $47 million from the extinguishment, which was comprised of the $49 million make-whole premium payment and a $2 million loss related to the write-off of deferred financing fees, partially offset by a $4 million gain relating to the write-off of unamortized fair value swap terminations. The Company also recognized a pre-tax loss of $20 million relating to the unamortized loss on cash flow swap terminations related to the 2022 Term Notes. Refer to\nNote I, Financial Instruments\n, for further discussion.\nIn February 2020, the Company issued $750 million of senior unsecured term notes maturing March 15, 2030 (\"2030 Term Notes\") and $750.0 million of fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated debentures maturing March 15, 2060 (“2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures”). The 2030 Term Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of 2.3% per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears, and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated debt. The 2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of 4.0% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, up to but excluding March 15, 2025. From and including March 15, 2025, the interest rate will be reset for each subsequent five-year reset period equal to the Five-Year Treasury Rate plus 2.657%.  The Five-Year Treasury Rate is based on the average yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity, for five-year maturities.  On each five-year reset date, the 2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures can be called at par value. The 2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures are unsecured and rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt. The Company received total net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $1.5 billion, net of underwriting expenses and other fees associated with the transactions. The net proceeds from the offering were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisition funding.\nIn November 2019, the Company issued 7,500,000 Equity Units with a total notional value of $750 million (\"2019 Equity Units\"). Each unit has a stated amount of $100 and initially consists of a three-year forward stock purchase contract (\"2022 Purchase Contracts\") for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on November 15, 2022, for a price of $100, and a 10% beneficial ownership interest in one share of 0% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (\"Series D Preferred Stock\"). The Company received approximately $735 million in cash proceeds from the 2019 Equity Units, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions, and issued 750,000 shares of Series D Preferred Stock. The proceeds were used, together with cash on hand, to redeem the 2052 Junior Subordinated Debentures in December 2019. The Company also used $19 million of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions utilized to hedge potential economic dilution. On and after November 15, 2022, the Series D Preferred Stock may be converted into common stock at the option of the holder. At the election of the Company, upon conversion, the Company may deliver cash, common stock, or a combination thereof. On or after December 22, 2022, the Company may elect to redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to 100% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. If the Company calls the Series D Preferred Stock for redemption, holders may convert their shares immediately preceding the redemption date. Upon a successful remarketing of the Series D Preferred Stock (the \"Remarketed Series D Preferred Stock\"), the Company will receive additional cash proceeds of $750 million and issue shares of Remarketed Series D Preferred Stock. The Company pays the holders of the 2022 Purchase Contracts quarterly contract adjustment payments, which commenced February 15, 2020. As of January 1, 2022, the present value of the contract adjustment payments was approximately\n$38 million\n.\nIn March 2018, the Company purchased from a financial institution “at-the-money” capped call options with an approximate term of three years, on 3.2 million shares of its common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments) for an aggregate premium of $57 million. In February 2020, the Company net-share settled 0.6 million of the 3.2 million capped options on its common stock and received 61,767 shares using an average reference price of $162.26 per common share. On June 9, 2020, the Company amended the 2018 capped call options to align with and offset the potential economic dilution associated with the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, as further discussed below. Subsequent to the amendment, the capped call options had an initial lower strike price of $148.34 and an upper strike price of $165.00,\n42\nwhich was approximately 30% higher than the closing price of the Company's common stock on June 9, 2020. During the second quarter of 2021, the Company net share settled the remaining capped call options on its common stock and received\n344,004 shares using an average reference price of $209.80\nper common share.\nIn May 2017, the Company issued 7,500,000 Equity Units with a total notional value of $750 million (\"2017 Equity Units\"). Each unit had a stated amount of $100 and initially consisted of a three-year forward stock purchase contract (\"2020 Purchase Contracts\") for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on May 15, 2020, for a price of $100, and a 10% beneficial ownership interest in one share of 0% Series C Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $1,000 per share (\"Series C Preferred Stock\"). The Company received approximately $727 million in cash proceeds from the 2017 Equity Units, net of underwriting costs and commissions, before offering expenses, and issued 750,000 shares of Series C Preferred Stock. The proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term borrowings. The Company also used $25 million of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions utilized to hedge potential economic dilution.\nIn May 2020, the Company generated cash proceeds of $750 million from the successful remarketing of the Series C Preferred Stock (the \"Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock\"), as described more fully in\nNote J, Capital Stock\n. Upon completion of the remarketing, the holders of the 2017 Equity Units received 5,463,750 common shares and the Company issued 750,000 shares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock. Holders of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock are entitled to receive cumulative dividends, if declared by the Board of Directors, at an initial fixed rate equal to 5.0% per annum of the $1,000 per share liquidation preference (equivalent to $50.00 per annum per share). In connection with the remarketing, the conversion rate was reset to 6.7352 shares of the Company's common stock, whic\nh was\nequivalent to a conversion price of approximately $148.47 per share. Beginning on May 15, 2020, the holders have the option to convert the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. At the election of the Company, upon conversion, the Company may deliver cash, common stock, or a combination thereof. The Company did not have the right to redeem the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock prior to May 15, 2021. On April 28, 2021, the Company informed holders that it would redeem all outstanding shares of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock on June 3, 2021\n(the\n“\nRedemption date\n”\n) at $1,002.50 per share in cash (\n“\nRedemption price\n”)\n, which was equal to 100% of the liquidation preference of a share of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. If a holder elected to convert its shares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock prior to the Redemption Date, the Company elected a combination settlement with a specified cash amount of $1,000 per share. In June 2021, the Company redeemed the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock and settled all conversions, paying $750 million in cash and issuing 1,469,055 common shares.\nIn March 2015, the Company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty for 3,645,510 shares of common stock. The contract obligates the Company to pay $350 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. In February 2020, the Company amended the settlement date to April 2022, or earlier at the Company's option.\nRefer to\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\n, and\nNote J, Capital Stock\n, for further discussion regarding the Company's debt and equity arrangements.\n43\nContractual Obligations:\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s significant contractual obligations and commitments that impact its liquidity:\n(a)\nFuture payments on long-term debt encompass all payments related to aggregate debt maturities, excluding certain fair value adjustments included in long-term debt, as discussed further in\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements.\n(b)\nFuture interest payments on long-term debt reflect the applicable interest rate in effect at January 1, 2022\n.\n(c)\nFuture lease obligations in the table above include $81 million for discontinued operations, $25 million in 2022, $19 million in 2023, $14 million in 2024, $10 million in 2025, $6 million in 2026, and $7 million thereafter.\n(d)\nInventory purchase commitments primarily consist of open purchase orders to purchase raw materials, components, and sourced products.\n(e)\nFuture marketing commitments in the table above include $1.0 million in 2022 attributable to discontinued operations.\n(f)\nIn March 2015, the Company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty which obligates the Company to pay $350 million, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. In February 2020, the Company amended the settlement date to April 2022, or earlier at the Company's option. See\nNote J, Capital Stock,\nfor further discussion.\n(g)\nThis amount principally represents contributions either required by regulations or laws or, with respect to unfunded plans, necessary to fund current benefits. The Company has not presented estimated pension and post-retirement funding beyond 2022 as funding can vary significantly from year to year based upon changes in the fair value of the plan assets, actuarial assumptions, and curtailment/settlement actions.\n(h)\nThese amounts represent future contract adjustment payments to holders of the Company's 2022 Purchase Contracts. See\nNote J, Capital Stock,\nfor further discussion.\n(i)\nIncome tax liability for the one-time deemed repatriation tax on unremitted foreign earnings and profits.\n(j)\nPrepayment to vendor to support dedicated production of key material.\nTo the extent the Company can reliably determine when payments will occur, the related amounts will be included in the table above. However, due to the high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of potential future cash flows associated with the contingent consideration liability related to the Craftsman acquisition and the unrecognized tax liabilities of $289 million and $548 million, respectively, at January 1, 2022, the Company is unable to make a reliable estimate of when (if at all) these amounts may be paid. Refer to\nNote M, Fair Value Measurements,\nfor further discussion.\nPayments of the above contractual obligations (with the exception of payments related to debt principal, the forward stock purchase contract, contract adjustment fees, and tax obligations) will typically generate a cash tax benefit such that the net cash outflow will be lower than the gross amounts summarized above.\n44\nOther Significant Commercial Commitments:\nShort-term borrowings, long-term debt and lines of credit are explained in detail within\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\n.\nMARKET RISK\nMarket risk is the potential economic loss that may result from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments, currencies, commodities and other items traded in global markets. The Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices, bond prices and commodity prices, amongst others.\nExposure to foreign currency risk results because the Company, through its global businesses, enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies. The Company’s predominant currency exposures are related to the Euro, Canadian Dollar, British Pound, Australian Dollar, Brazilian Real, Chinese Renminbi and the Taiwan Dollar. Certain cross-currency trade flows arising from both trade and affiliate sales and purchases are consolidated and netted prior to obtaining risk protection through the use of various derivative financial instruments which may include: purchased basket options, purchased options, collars, cross-currency swaps and currency forwards. The Company is thus able to capitalize on its global positioning by taking advantage of naturally offsetting exposures and portfolio efficiencies to reduce the cost of purchasing derivative protection. At times, the Company also enters into foreign exchange derivative contracts to reduce the earnings and cash flow impacts of non-functional currency denominated receivables and payables, primarily for affiliate transactions. Gains and losses from these hedging instruments offset the gains or losses on the underlying net exposures. Management determines the nature and extent of currency hedging activities, and in certain cases, may elect to allow certain currency exposures to remain un-hedged. The Company may also enter into cross-currency swaps and forward contracts to hedge the net investments in certain subsidiaries and better match the cash flows of operations to debt service requirements. Management estimates the foreign currency impact from its derivative financial instruments outstanding at the end of 2021 would have been an incremental pre-tax loss of approximately $30 million based on a hypothetical 10% adverse movement in all net derivative currency positions. The Company follows risk management policies in executing derivative financial instrument transactions, and does not use such instruments for speculative purposes. The Company generally does not hedge the translation of its non-U.S. dollar earnings in foreign subsidiaries, but may choose to do so in certain instances in future periods.\nAs mentioned above, the Company routinely has cross-border trade and affiliate flows that cause an impact on earnings from foreign exchange rate movements. The Company is also exposed to currency fluctuation volatility from the translation of foreign earnings into U.S. dollars and the economic impact of foreign currency volatility on monetary assets held in foreign currencies. It is more difficult to quantify the transactional effects from currency fluctuations than the translational effects. Aside from the use of derivative instruments, which may be used to mitigate some of the exposure, transactional effects can potentially be influenced by actions the Company may take. For example, if an exposure occurs from a European entity sourcing product from a U.S. supplier it may be possible to change to a European supplier. Management estimates the combined translational and transactional impact, on pre-tax earnings, of a 10% overall movement in exchange rates is approximately $209 million, or approximately $1.18 per diluted share. In 2021, translational and transactional foreign currency fluctuations negatively impacted pre-tax earnings from continuing operations by approximately $17 million, or approximately $0.10 per diluted share.\nThe Company’s exposure to interest rate risk results from its outstanding debt and derivative obligations, short-term investments, and derivative financial instruments employed in the management of its debt portfolio. The debt portfolio including both trade and affiliate debt, is managed to achieve capital structure targets and reduce the overall cost of borrowing by using a combination of fixed and floating rate debt as well as interest rate swaps, and cross-currency swaps.\nThe Company’s primary exposure to interest rate risk comes from its commercial paper program in which the pricing is partially based on short-term U.S. interest rates. At January 1, 2022, the impact of a hypothetical 10% increase in the interest rates associated with the Company’s commercial paper borrowings would have an immaterial effect on the Company’s financial position and results of operations.\nThe Company has exposure to commodity prices in many businesses, particularly brass, nickel, resin, aluminum, copper, zinc, steel, and energy used in the production of finished goods. Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments, but instead are actively managed through customer product and service pricing actions, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects.\n45\nThe Company has $136 million of liabilities as of January 1, 2022 pertaining to unfunded defined contribution plans for certain U.S. employees for which there is mark-to-market exposure.\nThe assets held by the Company’s defined benefit plans are exposed to fluctuations in the market value of securities, primarily global stocks and fixed-income securities. The funding obligations for these plans would increase in the event of adverse changes in the plan asset values, although such funding would occur over a period of many years. In 2021, 2020, and 2019, investment returns on pension plan assets resulted in increases of $81 million, $280 million, and\n$323 million\n, respectively. The Company expects funding obligations on its defined benefit plans to be approximately $41 million in 2022. The Company employs diversified asset allocations to help mitigate this risk. Management has worked to minimize this exposure by freezing and terminating defined benefit plans where appropriate.\nThe Company has access to financial resources and borrowing capabilities around the world. There are no inst\nruments within the debt structure that would accelerate payment requirements solely due to a change in credit rating.\nThe Company’s existing credit facilities and sources of liquidity, including operating cash flows, are considered more than adequate to conduct business as normal. Accordingly, based on present conditions and past history, management believes it is unlikely that operations will be materially affected by any potential deterioration of the general credit markets that may occur. The Company believes that its strong financial position, operating cash flows, committed long-term credit facilities and borrowing capacity, and ability to access equity markets, provide the financial flexibility necessary to continue its record of annual dividend payments, to invest in the routine needs of its businesses, to make strategic acquisitions and to fund other initiatives encompassed by its growth strategy and maintain its strong investment grade credit ratings.\nOTHER MATTERS\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan (\"ESOP\")\n—\nAs detailed in\nNote L, Employee Benefit Plans\n, the Company has an ESOP under which the ongoing U.S. Core and 401(k) defined contribution plans have been funded. Overall ESOP expense was affected by the market value of the Company’s stock on the monthly dates when shares were released, among other factors. The Company’s net ESOP activity resulted in expense of $59.1 million and $4.4 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and income of $5.1 million in 2019\n. U.S. defined contribution retirement plan expense increased in 2021 as all remaining unallocated shares in the ESOP were released in the first quarter of 2020. In addition, employer contributions to the plan were suspended for the last three quarters of 2020.\nCRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES —\nPreparation of the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. Significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are described in\nNote A, Significant Accounting Policies\n. Management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments, because of their significance to the Consolidated Financial Statements, result primarily from the need to make estimates about the effects of matters with inherent uncertainty. The most significant areas involving management estimates are described below. Actual results in these areas could differ from management’s estimates.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS — The Company acquires businesses in purchase transactions that result in the recognition of goodwill and intangible assets. The determination of the value of intangible assets requires management to make estimates and assumptions. In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350-20,\nGoodwill\n, acquired goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are not amortized but are subject to impairment testing at least annually or when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not an impairment exists. Definite-lived intangible assets are amortized and are tested for impairment when an event occurs or circumstances change that indicate it is more likely than not that an impairment exists. Goodwill represents costs in excess of fair values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. At January 1, 2022, the Company reported $8.784 billion of goodwill, $2.525 billion of indefinite-lived trade names and $2.175 billion of net definite-lived intangibles.\nManagement tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. A reporting unit is an operating segment as defined in ASC 280,\nSegment Reporting\n, or one level below an operating segment (component level) as determined by the availability of discrete financial information that is regularly reviewed by operating segment management or an aggregate of component levels of an operating segment having similar economic characteristics. If the carrying value of a reporting unit (including the value of goodwill) is greater than its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recorded for the amount that the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeded its fair value.\nAs required by the Company’s policy, goodwill was tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2021. In accordance with Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2011-08, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other (Topic 350):\nTesting Goodwill for Impairment\n, companies are permitted to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the\n46\nfair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. Impairment tests are completed separately with respect to the goodwill of each of the Company’s reporting units. For its annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2021, the Company applied the qualitative assessment for two of its reporting units, while performing the quantitative test for three of its reporting units. Based on the results of the Company’s annual impairment testing, it was determined that the fair value of each of its reporting units is substantially in excess of its carrying amount.\nIn performing the qualitative assessments, the Company identified and considered the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit. These factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. The Company also assessed changes in each reporting unit's fair value and carrying value since the most recent date a fair value measurement was performed. As a result of the qualitative assessments performed, the Company concluded that it is more likely than not that the fair value of each of these reporting units exceeded its respective carrying value and therefore, no additional quantitative impairment testing was performed.\nWith respect to the quantitative tests, the Company assessed the fair values of the three reporting units based on a discounted cash flow valuation model. The key assumptions applied to the cash flow projections were discount rates, which ranged from 7.0% to 8.0%, near-term revenue growth rates over the next six years, which represented cumulative annual growth rates ranging from approximately 4% to 7%, and perpetual growth rates of 3%. These assumptions contemplated business, market and overall economic conditions. Based on the results of this testing, the Company determined that the fair value for each of these reporting units exceeded its carrying amount by in excess of 50%. Furthermore, management performed sensitivity analyses on the estimated fair values from the discounted cash flow valuation models utilizing more conservative assumptions that reflect reasonably likely future changes in the discount rate and perpetual growth rate. The discount rate was increased by 100 basis points with no impairment indicated. The perpetual growth rate was decreased by 150 basis points with no impairment indicated.\nThe Company also tested its indefinite-lived trade names for impairment during the third quarter of 2021 utilizing a discounted cash flow model. The key assumptions used included discount rates, royalty rates, and perpetual growth rates applied to the projected sales. The Company determined that the fair values of its indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nIn the event that future operating results of any of the Company's reporting units or indefinite-lived trade names do not meet current expectations, management, based upon conditions at the time, would consider taking restructuring or other strategic actions, as necessary, to maximize revenue growth and profitability. A thorough analysis of all the facts and circumstances existi\nng at that time would need to be performed to determine if recording an impairment loss would be appropriate.\nDEFINED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS — The valuation of pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations is dependent on various assumptions. These assumptions, which are updated annually, include discount rates, expected return on plan assets, future salary increase rates, and health care cost trend rates. The Company considers current market conditions, including interest rates, to establish these assumptions. Discount rates are developed considering the yields available on high-quality fixed income investments with maturities corresponding to the duration of the related benefit obligations. The Company’s weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at January 1, 2022 for the United States and international pension plans were 2.80% and 1.78%, respectively. The Company’s weighted-average discount rates used to determine benefit obligations at January 2, 2021 for the United States and international pension plans were 2.39% and 1.31%, respectively. As discussed further in\nNote L, Employee Benefit Plans\n, the Company develops the expected return on plan assets considering various factors, which include its targeted asset allocation percentages, historic returns, and expected future returns. The Company’s expected rate of return assumptions for the United States and international pension plans were 4.75% and 3.25%, respectively, at January 1, 2022. The Company will us\ne a 4.07% we\nighted-average expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2022 net periodic benefit cost. A 25 basis point reduction in the expected rate of return assumption would increase 2022 net periodic benefit cost by approximately $6 million on a pre-tax basis.\nThe Company believes that the assumptions used are appropriate; however, differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the Company’s financial position or results of operations. To the extent that actual (newly measured) results differ from the actuarial assumptions, the difference is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss, and, if in excess of a specified corridor, amortized over future periods. The expected return on plan assets is determined using the expected rate of return and the fair value of plan assets. Accordingly, market fluctuations in the fair value of plan assets can affect the net periodic benefit cost in the following year. The projected benefit obligation for defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of plan assets by $432 million at January 1, 2022. A 25 basis point reduction in the discount rate would have increased the projected benefit obligation by approximately $101 million at January 1, 2022. The primary Black & Decker U.S. pension and post employment benefit plans were curtailed in late 2010, as well as the only material Black & Decker\n47\ninternational plan, and in their place the Company implemented defined contribution benefit plans. The vast majority of the projected benefit obligation pertains to plans that have been frozen; the remaining defined benefit plans that are not frozen are predominantly small domestic union plans and those that are statutorily mandated in certain international jurisdictions. The Company recognized approximately $8 million of defined benefit plan income in 2021, which may fluctuate in future years depending upon various factors including future discount rates and actual returns on plan assets.\nENVIRONMENTAL — The Company incurs costs related to environmental issues as a result of various laws and regulations governing current operations as well as the remediation of previously contaminated sites. The Company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company had reserves of $159 million for remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. The range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $94 million to $229 million which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with this policy.\nINCOME TAXES — The Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards. In the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. Conversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made.\nThe Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires a two-step process. First, management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second, for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority. The Company maintains an accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes. Many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the Company's tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the Company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, litigation, or other proceedings with taxing authorities. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty.\nAdditional information regarding income taxes is available in\nNote Q, Income Taxes.\n48\nCAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION\nREFORM ACT OF 1995\nThis document contains “forward-looking statements” within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

    "text": "Material Weaknesses in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (the \"Company\") is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as that term is defined under Rules 13a-15(f) and 15d-15(f) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”). Under the supervision and with the participation of management, including the Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Financial Officer, the Company has assessed the effectiveness of its internal control over financial reporting as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Based on that assessment, the Chief Executive Officer and the President and Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Company's internal control over financial reporting was not effective to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of its financial reporting and the preparation of its financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America as of January 1, 2022 due to the material weaknesses in internal control described below.\nA material weakness, as defined in Rule 12b-2 under the Exchange Act, is a deficiency, or a combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of a company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis.\nSubsequent to the filing of its 2020 Form 10-K, the Company received comments from the SEC Staff regarding its accounting for equity units issued in May 2017 and November 2019 (the “Equity Units”). Upon further reflection of the comments received by the Staff and the nature of the Equity Units, the Company determined that errors were made in its original accounting conclusions resulting from material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting for such instruments. The Company determined the errors were the result of the following deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting:\n1.\nThe design of its control to consider all the relevant authoritative accounting guidance for financial instruments with debt- and equity-like features; and\n2.\nThe design of its control to consider financial instruments with debt- and equity-like features in the calculation of earnings per share.\nThe Company assessed whether there was a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement would not have been prevented or detected on a timely basis as a result of the above control deficiencies. The first control deficiency could result in a determination that there are two units of account in which the forward stock purchase contracts, when evaluated separately as freestanding instruments, would be precluded from equity classification. As a result, the asset or liability related to the forward stock purchase contracts would be subject to mark-to-market accounting, which would be significantly influenced by factors outside of the Company’s control, including fluctuations in its share price. The second control deficiency resulted in material errors in the calculation of diluted earnings per share previously disclosed in the Company’s historical financial statements. Based on these factors, the Company concluded that the deficiencies noted above each rise to the level of a material weakness.\nRemediation of Material Weaknesses\nThe Company acknowledges that its management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting and assessing the effectiveness of its internal controls. The Company is committed to maintaining a strong internal control environment and implementing measures to ensure that the control deficiencies identified above are remediated as soon as possible. Management is in the process of implementing its remediation plan, which includes steps to design and implement new controls and expand education and training related to the accounting considerations for complex financing transactions. The Company will consider the material weakness remediated after the applicable controls operate for a sufficient period of time, and management has concluded, through testing, that the controls are operating effectively.\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nThe Company’s management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\n52\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 80 percent ownership stake in MTD Holdings Inc. (\"MTD\") and Excel Industries (\"Excel\") for approximately $1.5 billion and $374 million, respectfully. Since Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. has not yet fully incorporated the internal controls and procedures of MTD and Excel into Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting, management excluded these businesses from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2022. MTD accounted for 5% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s total assets as of January 1, 2022 and 1% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s net sales for the year then ended. Excel accounted less than 1% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s total assets as of January 1, 2022 and less than 1% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s net sales for the year then ended.\nOther than those items noted above, there has been no change in the Company’s internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal year ended January 1, 2022 that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the Company’s internal control over financial reporting.\nRefer to Management’s Report On Internal Control Over Financial Reporting on page 63."

Internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external reporting purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company acquired the remaining 80 percent ownership stake in MTD Holdings Inc. (\"MTD\") and Excel Industries (\"Excel\") for approximately $1.5 billion and $374 million, respectfully. Since Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. has not yet fully incorporated the internal controls and procedures of MTD and Excel into Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s internal control over financial reporting, management excluded these businesses from its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2022. MTD accounted for 5% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s total assets as of January 1, 2022 and 1% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s net sales for the year then ended. Excel accounted for less than 1% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s total assets as of January 1, 2022 and less than 1% of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.'s net sales for the year then ended.\nManagement has assessed the effectiveness of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2022. In making its assessment, management has utilized the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations (COSO) of the Treadway Commission in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013 Framework). Management concluded that based on its assessment, and the existence of material weaknesses related to the accounting for equity units issued in May 2017 and November 2019, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of January 1, 2022. Ernst & Young LLP, Registered Public Accounting Firm included in this annual report, has issued an attestation report on the registrant’s internal control over financial reporting, a copy of which appears on page 67.\n63\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareowners and Board of Directors of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (the Company) as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the related consolidated statements of operations, comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2022, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2022, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 22, 2022 expressed an adverse opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that: (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the consolidated financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate\n.\n64\n65\n/s/\nErnst & Young LLP\nWe have served as the Company’s auditor since 1932.\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 22, 2022\n66\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareowners and the Board of Directors of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Stanley Black & Decker, Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, because of the effect of the material weaknesses described below on the achievement of the objectives of the control criteria, Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. (the Company) has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of January 1, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nA material weakness is a deficiency, or combination of deficiencies, in internal control over financial reporting, such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of the company’s annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. The following material weaknesses have been identified and included in management’s assessment. Management has identified material weaknesses in controls related to (1) the design of its control to consider financial instruments with debt- and equity-like features in the calculation of earnings per share and (2) the design of its control to consider all the relevant authoritative accounting guidance for financial instruments with debt- and equity-like features.\nAs indicated in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting, management’s assessment of and conclusion on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting did not include the internal controls of MTD Holdings, Inc. or Excel Industries, which are included in the 2021 consolidated financial statements of the Company and constituted 5% and less than 1% of total and net assets, respectively, as of January 1, 2022 and 1% and less than 1% of net sales, respectively, for the year then ended. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting of the Company also did not include an evaluation of the internal control over financial reporting of MTD Holdings, Inc. or Excel Industries.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, related consolidated statements of comprehensive income, shareowners’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended January 1, 2022, and the related notes and schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a). The material weaknesses were considered in determining the nature, timing and extent of audit tests applied in our audit of the 2021 consolidated financial statements, and this report does not affect our report dated February 22, 2022, which expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\n67\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nHartford, Connecticut\nFebruary 22, 2022\n68\nConsolidated Statements of Operations\nFiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019\n(Millions of Dollars, Except Per Share Amounts)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n69\nConsolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income\nFiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019\n(Millions of Dollars)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n70\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\nJanuary 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021\n(Millions of Dollars, Except Share and Per Share Amounts)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n71\nConsolidated Statements of Cash Flows\nFiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019\n(Millions of Dollars)\n72\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balances as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, as shown above:\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n73\nConsolidated Statements of Changes in Shareowners’ Equity\nFiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019\n(Millions of Dollars, Except Share and Per Share Amounts)\nSee Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements.\n74\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nA.\nSIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBASIS OF PRESENTATION —\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Stanley Black & Decker, Inc. and its majority-owned subsidiaries (collectively the “Company”) which require consolidation, after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. The Company’s fiscal year ends on the Saturday nearest to December 31. There were 52 weeks in fiscal year 2021, 53 weeks in the fiscal years 2020, and 52 weeks in fiscal year 2019.\nIn December 2021, the Company acquired the remaining\n80\npercent ownership stake in MTD Holdings Inc. (\"MTD\"), a privately held global manufacturer of outdoor power equipment. The Company previously acquired a\n20\npercent interest in MTD in January 2019. Prior to closing on the remaining\n80\npercent ownership stake, the Company applied the equity method of accounting to the\n20\n% investment in MTD. In November 2021, the Company acquired Excel Industries (\"Excel\"), a leading designer and manufacturer of premium commercial and residential turf-care equipment. These acquisitions are being accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and the results subsequent to the dates of acquisition are included in the Company's Tools & Storage segment.\nIn February 2020, the Company acquired Consolidated Aerospace Manufacturing, LLC (\"CAM\"). In March 2019, the Company acquired International Equipment Solutions Attachments businesses, Paladin and Pengo, (\"IES Attachments\"). The 2020 and 2019 acquisitions were accounted for as business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and the results subsequent to the respective dates of acquisition are included in the Company's Industrial segment.\nRefer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments\n, for further discussion on these transactions.\nIn December 2021, upon announcing it reached a definitive agreement for the sale of most of its Security assets, the Company classified the Convergent Security Solutions (\"CSS\") business as held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021. The operating results of CSS have been reported as discontinued operations in the Consolidated Financial Statements.  Amounts previously reported have been reclassified to conform to this presentation in accordance with Accounting Standard Codification (\"ASC\") 205\n, Presentation of Financial Statements\n(\"ASC 205\")\n,\nto allow for meaningful comparison of continuing operations.\nIn November 2020, the Company sold its commercial electronic operations in\nfive\ncountries in Europe and emerging markets within the Security segment. In October 2020, the Company sold a product line in Oil & Gas within the Industrial segment. The operating results of these businesses have been reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements through the dates of sale in 2020 and for the year ended December 28, 2019.\nIn May 2019, the Company sold its Sargent & Greenleaf mechanical locks business within the Security segment. The operating results of this business have been reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements through the date of sale in 2019.\nRefer to\nNote T, Divestitures\n, for further discussion on these transactions.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements. While management believes that the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are appropriate, actual results could differ from these estimates. Certain amounts reported in previous years have been reclassified to conform to the 2021 presentation.\nFOREIGN CURRENCY —\nFor foreign operations with functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar, asset and liability accounts are translated at current exchange rates, while income and expenses are translated using average exchange rates. Translation adjustments are reported in a separate component of shareowners’ equity and exchange gains and losses on transactions are included in earnings.\nCASH EQUIVALENTS —\nHighly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered cash equivalents.\nACCOUNTS AND FINANCING RECEIVABLE —\nTrade receivables are stated at gross invoice amounts less discounts, other allowances and provisions for credit losses. Financing receivables are initially recorded at fair value, less impairments or provisions for credit losses. Interest income earned from financing receivables that are not delinquent is recorded on the effective interest method. The Company considers any financing receivable that has not been collected within 90 days of\n75\noriginal billing date as past-due or delinquent. The Company's payment terms are generally consistent with the industries in which its businesses operate and typically range from 30-90 days globally. Additionally, the Company considers the credit quality of all past-due or delinquent financing receivables as nonperforming. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the period between transfer of the product and receipt of payment is less than one year. Any significant financing components for contracts greater than one year are included in revenue over time.\nALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES —\nThe Company maintains an allowance for credit losses, which represents an estimate of expected losses over the remaining contractual life of its receivables. The allowance is determined using two methods. The amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved. First, a specific reserve is established for individual accounts where information indicates the customers may have an inability to meet financial obligations. Second, a reserve is determined for all customers based on a range of percentages applied to aging categories. These percentages are based on historical collection rates, write-off experience, and forecasts of future economic conditions. Actual write-offs are charged against the allowance when collection efforts have been unsuccessful.\nINVENTORIES —\nU.S. inventories are primarily valued at the lower of Last-In First-Out (“LIFO”) cost or market because the Company believes it results in better matching of costs and revenues. Other inventories are primarily valued at the lower of First-In, First-Out (“FIFO”) cost and net realizable value because LIFO is not permitted for statutory reporting outside the U.S. Refer to\nNote C, Inventories\n, for a quantification of the LIFO impact on inventory valuation.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT —\nThe Company generally values property, plant and equipment (“PP&E”), including capitalized software, at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Costs related to maintenance and repairs which do not prolong the asset's useful life are expensed as incurred.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided using straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:\nLeasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life or the term of the lease.\nThe Company reports depreciation and amortization of property, plant and equipment in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses based on the nature of the underlying assets. Depreciation and amortization related to the production of inventory and delivery of services are recorded in cost of sales. Depreciation and amortization related to distribution center activities, selling and support functions are reported in selling, general and administrative expenses.\nThe Company assesses its long-lived assets for impairment when indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable are present. In assessing long-lived assets for impairment, the Company groups its long-lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are generated (“asset group”) and estimates the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with, and expected to be generated from, the use of and eventual disposition of the asset group. If the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows, an impairment loss must be determined and the asset group is written down to fair value. The impairment loss is quantified by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group to the estimated fair value, which is generally determined using weighted-average discounted cash flows that consider various possible outcomes for the disposition of the asset group.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS —\nGoodwill represents costs in excess of values assigned to the underlying net assets of acquired businesses. Intangible assets acquired are recorded at estimated fair value. Goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually during the third quarter, and at any time when events suggest an impairment more likely than not has occurred.\nTo assess goodwill for impairment, the Company, depending on relevant facts and circumstances, performs either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative analysis utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation model. In performing a qualitative assessment, the Company first assesses relevant factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount as a basis for determining whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test. The Company identifies and considers the significance of relevant key factors, events, and circumstances that could affect the fair value of each reporting unit. These factors include external factors such as macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as entity-specific factors, such as actual and planned financial performance. The Company also considers changes in each reporting unit's fair value and carrying amount since the most recent date a fair value measurement was\n76\nperformed. In performing a quantitative analysis, the Company determines the fair value of a reporting unit using management’s assumptions about future cash flows based on long-range strategic plans. This approach incorporates many assumptions including discount rates, future growth rates and expected profitability. In the event the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeded its fair value, an impairment loss would be recognized.\nIndefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment utilizing either a qualitative assessment or a quantitative analysis. For a qualitative assessment, the Company identifies and considers relevant key factors, events, and circumstances to determine whether it is necessary to perform a quantitative impairment test. The key factors considered include macroeconomic, industry, and market conditions, as well as the asset's actual and forecasted results. For the quantitative impairment tests, the Company compares the carrying amounts to the current fair market values, usually determined by the estimated royalty savings attributable to owning the intangible assets. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives to reflect the pattern over which the economic benefits of the intangible assets are consumed. Definite-lived intangible assets are also evaluated for impairment when impairment indicators are present. If the carrying amount exceeds the total undiscounted future cash flows, a discounted cash flow analysis is performed to determine the fair value of the asset. If the carrying amount of the asset was to exceed the fair value, it would be written down to fair value. No significant goodwill or other intangible asset impairments were recorded during 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS —\nDerivative financial instruments are employed to manage risks, including foreign currency, interest rate exposures and commodity prices and are not used for trading or speculative purposes. As part of the Company’s risk management program, a variety of financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, purchased currency options, foreign exchange contracts and commodity contracts, may be used to mitigate interest rate exposure, foreign currency exposure and commodity price exposure. The Company recognizes all derivative instruments on the balance sheet at fair value.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives are recognized periodically either in earnings or in shareowners’ equity as a component of other comprehensive income (loss) (\"OCI\"), depending on whether the derivative financial instrument is undesignated or qualifies for hedge accounting, and if so, whether it represents a fair value, cash flow, or net investment hedge. Changes in the fair value of derivatives accounted for as fair value hedges are recorded in earnings in the same caption as the changes in the fair value of the hedged items. Gains and losses on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges, to the extent they are included in the assessment of effectiveness, are recorded in OCI and subsequently reclassified to earnings to offset the impact of the hedged items when they occur. In the event it becomes probable the forecasted transaction to which a cash flow hedge relates will not occur, the derivative would be terminated and the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) would be recognized in earnings. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as a hedge of the net investment in foreign operations, to the extent they are included in the assessment of effectiveness, are reported in OCI and are deferred until disposal of the underlying assets. Gains and losses representing components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for cash flow and fair value hedges are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis in the same caption as the hedged item over the term of the hedge. Gains and losses representing components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for net investment hedges are recognized in earnings on a straight-line basis in Other, net over the term of the hedge.\nThe net interest paid or received on interest rate swaps is recognized as interest expense. Gains and losses resulting from the early termination of interest rate swap agreements are deferred and amortized as adjustments to interest expense over the remaining period of the debt originally covered by the terminated swap.\nChanges in the fair value of derivatives not designated as hedges are reported in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. Refer to\nNote I, Financial Instruments\n, for further discussion.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION —\nThe Company’s revenues result from the sale of goods or services and reflect the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled. The Company records revenue based on a five-step model in accordance with ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n(\"ASC 606\"). For its contracts with customers, the Company identifies the performance obligations (goods or services), determines the transaction price, allocates the contract transaction price to the performance obligations, and recognizes the revenue when (or as) the performance obligation is transferred to the customer. A good or service is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. The majority of the Company’s revenues are recorded at a point in time from the sale of tangible products.\nA portion of the Company’s revenues within the CSS and Infrastructure businesses is generated from equipment leased to custome\nrs.\nCustomer arrangements are identified as leases if they include transfer of a tangible asset which is provided to the customer in exchange for payments typically at fixed rates payable monthly, quarterly or annually. Customer leases may include terms to allow for extension of leases for a short period of time, but typically do not provide for customer termination prior to the initial term. Some customer leases include terms to allow the customer to purchase the underlying asset, which occurs occasionally, and virtually no customer leases include residual value guarantee clauses. Within the CSS business, the\n77\nunderlying asset typically has no value at termination of the customer lease, so no residual value asset is recorded in the financial statements. For\nInfrastructure business leases, underlying assets are assessed for functionality at termination of the lease and, if necessary, an impairment to the leased asset value is recorded.\nProvisions for customer volume rebates, product returns, discounts and allowances are variable consideration and are recorded as a reduction of revenue in the same period the related sales are recorded. Such provisions are calculated using historical averages adjusted for any expected changes due to current business conditions. Consideration given to customers for cooperative advertising is recognized as a reduction of revenue except to the extent that there is a distinct good or service and evidence of the fair value of the advertising, in which case the expense is classified as selling, general, and administrative expense.\nThe Company’s revenues can be generated from contracts with multiple performance obligations. When a contract involves multiple performance obligations, each obligation is separately identified and the transaction price is allocated based on the amount of consideration the Company expects to be entitled to in exchange for transferring the promised good or service to the customer.\nSales of security monitoring systems, within the CSS business, may have multiple performance obligations, including equipment, installation and monitoring or maintenance services. In most instances, the Company allocates the appropriate amount of consideration to each performance obligation based on the standalone selling price (\"SSP\") of the distinct goods or services performance obligation. In circumstances where SSP is not observable, the Company allocates the consideration for the performance obligations by utilizing one of the following methods: expected cost plus margin, the residual approach, or a mix of these estimation methods.\nFor performance obligations that the Company satisfies over time, revenue is recognized by consistently applying a method of measuring progress toward complete satisfaction of that performance obligation. The Company utilizes the method that most\naccurately depicts the progress toward completion of the performance obligation.\nThe Company’s contract sales for the installation of security intruder systems and other construction-related projects, within the CSS busines\ns,\nare generally recorded under the input method. The input method recognizes revenue on the basis of the Company’s efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation relative to the total inputs expected to satisfy that performance obligation. Revenue recognized on security contracts in process are based upon the allocated contract price and related total inputs of the project at completion. The extent of progress toward completion is generally measured using input methods based on labor metrics. Revisions to these estimates as contracts progress have the effect of increasing or decreasing profits each period. Provisions for anticipated losses are made in the period in which they become determinable. The revenues for monitoring and monitoring-related services are recognized as services are rendered over the contractual period.\nThe Company utilizes the output method for contract sales in the Oil & Gas product line. The output method recognizes revenue based on direct measurements of the customer value of the goods or services transferred to date relative to the remaining goods or services promised under the contract. The output method includes methods such as surveys of performance completed to date, appraisals of results achieved, milestones reached, time elapsed, and units produced or units delivered.\nContract assets or liabilities result from transactions with revenue recorded over time. If the measure of remaining rights exceeds the measure of the remaining performance obligations, the Company records a contract asset. Conversely, if the measure of the remaining performance obligations exceeds the measure of the remaining rights, the Company records a contract liability.\nIncremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract with a customer that are expected to be recovered are recognized and classified in Other current assets or Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are typically amortized over the contract period. The Company recognizes the incremental costs of obtaining or fulfilling a contract as expense when incurred if the amortization period of the asset is one year or less.\nCustomer billings for services not yet rendered are deferred and recognized as revenue as the services are rendered. The associated deferred revenue is included in Accrued expenses or Other liabilities, as appropriate, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nRefer to\nNote B, Accounts and Notes Receivable,\nfor further discussion.\nCOST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL & ADMINISTRATIVE —\nCost of sales includes the cost of products and services provided, reflecting costs of manufacturing and preparing the product for sale. These costs include expenses to acquire\n78\nand manufacture products to the point that they are allocable to be sold to customers and costs to perform services pertaining to service revenues (e.g. installation of security systems, automatic doors, and security monitoring costs). Cost of sales is primarily comprised of freight, direct materials, direct labor as well as overhead which includes indirect labor and facility and equipment costs. Cost of sales also includes quality control, procurement and material receiving costs as well as internal transfer costs. Selling, general & administrative costs (\"SG&A\") include the cost of selling products as well as administrative function costs. These expenses generally represent the cost of selling and distributing the products once they are available for sale and primarily include salaries and commissions of the Company’s sales force, distribution costs, notably salaries and facility costs, as well as administrative expenses for certain support functions and related overhead.\nADVERTISING COSTS —\nTelevision advertising is expensed the first time the advertisement airs, whereas other advertising is expensed as incurred.\nAdvertising costs are classified in SG&A and amounted to $\n98.6\nmillion in 2021, $\n76.6\nmillion in 2020 and $\n90.5\nmillion in 2019. Expense pertaining to cooperative advertising with customers reported as a reduction of Net Sales was $\n374.1\nmillion in 2021, $\n351.0\nmillion in 2020 and $\n317.8\nmillion in 2019. Cooperative advertising with customers classified as SG&A expense amounted to $\n19.5\nmillion in 2021, $\n15.8\nmillion in 2020 and $\n5.6\nmillion in 2019.\nSALES TAXES —\nSales and value added taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from Net Sales reported in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nSHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS —\nThe Company generally does not bill customers for freight. Shipping and handling costs associated with inbound and outbound freight are reported in Cost of sales.\nDistribution costs are classified in SG&A and amounted to $\n416.5\nmillion, $\n347.3\nmillion and $\n326.5\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION —\nCompensation cost relating to stock-based compensation grants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, which is generally\nfour years\n. The expense for stock options and restricted stock units awarded to retirement-eligible employees (those aged\n55\nand over, and with\n10\nor more years of service) is recognized on the grant date, or (if later) by the date they become retirement-eligible.\nPOSTRETIREMENT DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN —\nThe Company uses the corridor approach to determine expense recognition for each defined benefit pension and other postretirement plan. The corridor approach defers actuarial gains and losses resulting from variances between actual and expected results (based on economic estimates or actuarial assumptions) and amortizes them over future periods. For pension plans, these unrecognized gains and losses are amortized when the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the greater of the market-related value of plan assets or the projected benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. For other postretirement benefits, amortization occurs when the net gains and losses exceed 10% of the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at the beginning of the year. For ongoing, active plans, the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining service period for active plan participants. For plans with primarily inactive participants, the amount in excess of the corridor is amortized on a straight-line basis over the average remaining life expectancy of inactive plan participants.\nINCOME TAXES —\nThe Company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method in accordance with ASC 740,\nIncome Taxes\n, which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Any changes in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized in earnings in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company recognizes the tax on global intangible low-taxed income as a period expense in the period the tax is incurred.\nThe Company records net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that these assets will be realized. In making this determination, management considers all available positive and negative evidence, including future reversals of existing temporary differences, estimates of future taxable income, tax-planning strategies, and the realizability of net operating loss carryforwards. In the event that it is determined that an asset is not more likely that not to be realized, a valuation allowance is recorded against the asset. Valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws, changes to statutory tax rates and future taxable income levels. In the event the Company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or a portion of its deferred tax assets in the future, the unrealizable amount would be charged to earnings in the period in which that determination is made. Conversely, if the Company were to determine that it would be able to realize deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net carrying amounts, it would decrease the recorded valuation allowance through a favorable adjustment to earnings in the period that the determination was made. The Company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with ASC 740, which requires a two-step process. First, management determines whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and second, for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not threshold, management recognizes the largest amount of the tax benefit that is greater than 50 percent likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the related taxing authority. The Company maintains\n79\nan accounting policy of recording interest and penalties on uncertain tax positions as a component of Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nThe Company is subject to income tax in a number of locations, including many state and foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required when calculating the worldwide provision for income taxes. Many factors are considered when evaluating and estimating the Company's tax positions and tax benefits, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the Company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. These changes may be the result of settlements of ongoing audits, litigation, or other proceedings with taxing authorities. The Company periodically assesses its liabilities and contingencies for all tax years still subject to audit based on the most current available information, which involves inherent uncertainty.\nRefer to\nNote Q, Income Taxes,\nfor further discussion.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE —\nBasic earnings per share equals net earnings attributable to common shareowners divided by weighted-average shares outstanding during the year. Diluted earnings per share include the impact of common stock equivalents using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, when the effect is dilutive.\nNEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ADOPTED —\nIn January 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") issued Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2020-01,\nInvestments-Equity Securities (Topic 321), Investments-Equity Method and Joint Ventures (Topic 323), and Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815)\n. The new standard clarifies the interaction of accounting for the transition into and out of the equity method. The new standard also clarifies the accounting for measuring certain purchased options and forward contracts to acquire investments. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years.\nThe Company adopted this guidance in the first quarter of 2021 and it did not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued ASU 2019-12,\nIncome Taxes (Topic 740).\nThe new standard simplifies the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions for recognizing deferred taxes for investments, performing intra-period allocation and calculating income taxes in interim periods. The new standard also adds guidance to reduce complexity in certain areas, including recognizing deferred taxes for tax goodwill and allocating taxes to members of a consolidated group. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The Company adopted this standard in the first quarter of 2021 and it did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nRECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NOT YET ADOPTED\n— In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-08,\nBusiness Combinations (Topic 805), Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers\n. The new standard improves the accounting for acquired revenue contracts with customers in a business combination by addressing diversity in practice and inconsistency. The new standard requires an entity to recognize and measure contract assets and contract liabilities acquired in a business combination in accordance with ASC 606,\nRevenue from Contracts with Customers\n. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard should be applied prospectively to business combinations occurring on or after the effective date of the amendments. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2022 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn May 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-04,\nEarnings per share (Topic 260), Debt-Modifications and Extinguishments (Subtopic 470-50), Compensation-Stock Compensation (Topic 718), and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Equity (Subtopic 815-40).\nThe new standard clarifies and reduces diversity in an issuer’s accounting for modifications or exchanges of freestanding equity-classified written call options (for example, warrants) that remain equity classified after modification or exchange. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, including adoption in an interim period. The standard should be applied prospectively. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2022 and does not expect it to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements.\nIn August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06\n, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options (Subtopic 470-20) and Derivatives and Hedging – Contracts in Entity’s Own Equity (Subtopic 815-40).\nThe new standard reduces the number of accounting models for convertible debt instruments and convertible preferred stock, and amends the guidance for the derivatives scope exception for contracts in an entity's own equity. The standard also amends and makes targeted improvements to the related earnings per share guidance. The ASU is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2021, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Early adoption is permitted, but no earlier than fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim periods within those fiscal years. The standard allows for either modified or full retrospective transition methods. The Company will adopt this guidance in the first quarter of 2022.\n80\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848): Facilitation of the Effects of Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting.\nThe new standard provides optional expedients and exceptions that companies can apply during a limited time period to account for contracts, hedging relationships, and other transactions affected by reference rate reform, if certain criteria are met. Companies may elect to apply these optional expedients and exceptions beginning March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued ASU 2021-01,\nReference Rate Reform (Topic 848),\nto clarify the scope of Topic 848 and provide explicit guidance to help companies applying optional expedients and exceptions. This ASU is effective immediately for all entities that have applied optional expedients and exceptions. The Company plans to apply certain optional expedients and exceptions as needed to comply with regulatory and tax authorities for the transition to alternative reference rates.  The Company does not expect adoption to have a material impact to its consolidated financial statements.\nB.\nACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE\nTrade receivables are dispersed among a large number of retailers, distributors and industrial accounts in many countries. Adequate reserves have been established to cover anticipated credit losses. During the fourth quarter of 2021, as part of the acquisition of MTD, the Company acquired accounts receivable of $\n272.6\nmillion. Refer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments\n, for further discussion.\nThe changes in the allowance for credit losses for the years ended January 1, 2022 and\nJanuary 2, 2021\nare as follows:\n(a) Represents the cumulative-effect adjustment to opening retained earnings due to the adoption of ASU 2016-13.\n(b) Amounts represent the impacts of foreign currency translation, acquisitions and net transfers to/from other accounts.\n(c) Amounts represent charge-offs less recoveries of accounts previously charged-off.\nThe Company's payment terms are generally consistent with the industries in which their businesses operate and typically range from 30-90 days globally. The Company does not adjust the promised amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component when the period between transfer of the product and receipt of payment is less than one year. Any significant financing components for contracts greater than one year are included in revenue over time.\nAt January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Industrial segment operating lease receivable was $\n21.2\nmillion and $\n36.7\nmillion, respectively, from leasing equipment to customers. Net sales from operating lease revenue were $\n62.0\nmillion and $\n113.7\nmillion for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nThe Company has an accounts receivable sale program. According to the terms, the Company sells certain of its trade accounts receivables at fair value to a wholly owned, consolidated, bankruptcy-remote special purpose subsidiary (“BRS\"). The BRS, in turn, can sell such receivables to a third-party financial institution (“Purchaser”) for cash. The Purchaser’s maximum cash investment in the receivables at any time is\n$\n110.0\nmillion\n. The purpose of the program is to provide liquidity to the Company. These transfers qualify as sales under ASC 860,\nTransfers and Servicing,\nand receivables are derecognized from the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets when the BRS sells those receivables to the Purchaser. The Company has no retained interests in the transferred receivables, other than collection and administrative responsibilities. At January 1, 2022, the Company did not\n81\nrecord a servicing asset or liability related to its retained responsibility based on its assessment of the servicing fee, market values for similar transactions and its cost of servicing the receivables sold.\nAt January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, net receivables of approximately $\n100.0\nmillion and $\n86.8\nmillion, respectively, were derecognized. Proceeds from transfers of receivables to the Purchaser totaled $\n447.7\nmillion and $\n259.6\nmillion for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively, and payments to the Purchaser totaled $\n434.5\nmillion and $\n272.8\nmillion, respectively. The program resulted in a pre-tax loss of $\n2.0\nmillion and $\n1.7\nmillion for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively, which included service fees of $\n0.9\nmillion and $\n0.6\nmillion, respectively. All cash flows under the program are reported as a component of changes in accounts receivable within operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows since all the cash from the Purchaser is received upon the initial sale of the receivable.\nAs of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company's deferred revenue totaled $\n126.7\nmillion and $\n131.0\nmillion, respectively, of which $\n42.2\nmillion and $\n39.4\nmillion, respectively, was classified as current. Revenue recognized for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 that was previously deferred as of January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019 totaled $\n24.0\nmillion and $\n30.4\nmillion, respectively.\nC.\nINVENTORIES\nNet inventories in the amount of $\n2.6\nbillion at January 1, 2022 and $\n1.3\nbillion at January 2, 2021 were valued at the lower of LIFO cost or market. If the LIFO method had not been used, inventories would have been higher than reported by $\n228.5\nmillion at January 1, 2022 and $\n45.8\nmillion at January 2, 2021.\nAs part of the MTD and Excel acquisitions in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company acquired inventory with an estimated fair value of $\n900.7\nmillion and $\n49.9\nmillion, respectfully. Refer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments\n, for further discussion.\nD.\nPROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT\nDepreciation and amortization expense associated with property, plant and equipment was as follows:\nThe amounts above are inclusive of depreciation and amortization expense for discontinued operations amounting to $\n22.1\nmillion in 2021, $\n21.1\nmillion in 2020, and $\n19.7\nmillion in 2019.\nE.\nACQUISITIONS AND INVESTMENTS\n82\n2021 ACQUISITIONS\nMTD\nOn December 1, 2021, the Company acquired the remaining\n80\npercent ownership stake in MTD, a privately held global manufacturer of outdoor power equipment, for $\n1.5\nbillion, net of cash acquired and an estimated working capital adjustment.\nThe Company previously acquired a\n20\npercent interest in MTD in January 2019 for $\n234\nmillion. T\nhe Company’s pre-existing\n20\n% equity investment in MTD was remeasured at fair value of $\n295.1\nmillion as of the transaction date based on the purchase price for the remaining\n80\npercent ownership, which was calculated using an EBITDA-based formula. As a result, the Company recorded a $\n68.0\nmillion gain recognized in Gain on equity method investment in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nMTD designs, manufactures and distributes lawn tractors, zero turn ride on mowers, walk behind mowers, snow blowers, residential robotic mowers, handheld outdoor power equipment and garden tools for both residential and professional consumers under well-known brands like Cub Cadet® and Troy-Bilt®. This combination will create a global leader in the outdoor category, with strong brands and growth opportunities. The results of MTD subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's Tools & Storage segment.\nThe MTD acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated acquisition date value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nThe weighted-average useful life assigned to the definite-lived intangible assets was\n15\nyears.\n83\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected cost synergies of the combined business and assembled workforce. It is estimated that $\n0.6\nmillion of goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe acquisition accounting for MTD is preliminary in certain respects. During the measurement period, the Company expects to record adjustments relating to the finalization of intangible assets, inventory and property, plant and equipment valuations, working capital accounts, and opening balance sheet contingencies, amongst others.\nA single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company’s judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results from operations.\nExcel\nOn November 12, 2021, the Company acquired Excel Industries (\"Excel\") for $\n373.6\nmillion, net of cash acquired and an estimated working capital adjustment. Excel is a leading designer and manufacturer of premium commercial and residential turf-care equipment under the brands of Hustler Turf Equipment and BigDog Mower Co.  The results of Excel subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's Tools & Storage segment.\nThe Company believes this is a strategically important bolt-on acquisition as it builds an outdoor products leader. The Excel acquisition is being accounted for as a business combination, which requires, among other things, certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The estimated value of identifiable net assets acquired, which includes $\n37.0\nmillion of working capital, $\n48.7\nmillion of deferred tax liabilities, and $\n203.5\nmillion of intangible assets, is $\n200.3\nmillion. The related goodwill is $\n173.3\nmillion. The amount allocated to intangible assets includes $\n158.0\nmillion for customer relationships.  The weighted-average useful life assigned to the intangible assets was 14 years.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected cost synergies of the combined business and assembled workforce. It is estimated that $\n0.6\nmillion of goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe acquisition accounting for Excel is preliminary in certain respects. During the measurement period, the Company expects to record adjustments relating to the finalization of intangible and inventory valuations, working capital accounts, and opening balance sheet contingencies, amongst others.\nA single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions. The Company’s judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives, can materially impact the Company’s results from operations.\nOther 2021 Acquisitions\nDuring 2021, the Company completed two other acquisitions for a total purchase price of $\n207.3\nmillion, net of cash acquired. The estimated acquisition date value of the identifiable net assets acquired is $\n49.5\nmillion and working capital is $\n36.4\nmillion. The related goodwill is $\n157.8\nmillion. The results of these acquisitions subsequent to the dates of acquisition are included in the Company's Tools & Storage segment.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected cost synergies of the combined business and assembled workforce. It is estimated that $\n44.5\nmillion of goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe acquisition accounting for these acquisitions is preliminary in certain respects. During the measurement period, the Company expects to record adjustments relating to working capital accounts, various opening balance sheet contingencies and various income tax matters, amongst others.\n2020 ACQUISITION\nCAM\n84\nOn February 24, 2020, the Company acquired CAM for a total estimated purchase price of approximately $\n1.46\nbillion, net of cash acquired. The purchase price consisted of an initial cash payment of approximately $\n1.30\nbillion, net of cash acquired, and future payments up to $\n200.0\nmillion contingent on The Boeing Company (\"Boeing\") 737 MAX Airplanes receiving Federal Aviation Administration (\"FAA\") authorization to return to service and Boeing achieving certain production levels, which were valued at $\n155.3\nmillion as of the acquisition date.\nIn November 2020, the FAA rescinded the 737 MAX grounding order and as a result of the subsequent return to revenue service of the 737 MAX in December 2020, the Company paid $\n100\nmillion to the former owners of CAM. The remaining contingent consideration was remeasured at January 2, 2021 and the Company concluded the achievement of certain production levels based on Boeing’s future forecast was remote and released the remaining $\n55.3\nmillion contingent consideration liability to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other, net. As of January 1, 2022, the Company continues to consider the achievement of certain production levels based on Boeing’s future forecast as remote.\nCAM is an industry-leading manufacturer of specialty fasteners and components for the aerospace and defense markets. The acquisition further diversified the Company's presence in the industrial markets and expanded its portfolio of specialty fasteners in the aerospace and defense markets. The results of CAM subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's Industrial segment.\nThe CAM acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the acquisition date value of identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nThe weighted-average useful life assigned to the intangible assets is\n20\nyears.\nGoodwill is calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected cost synergies of the combined business and assembled workforce. It is estimated that $\n569.8\nmillion of goodwill will be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe acquisition accounting for CAM is complete. The measurement period adjustments recorded in 2021 did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2019 ACQUISITIONS\nIES Attachments\nOn March 8, 2019, the Company acquired IES Attachments for $\n653.5\nmillion, net of cash acquired. IES Attachments is a manufacturer of high quality, performance-driven heavy equipment attachment tools for off-highway applications. The\n85\nacquisition further diversified the Company's presence in the industrial markets, expanded its portfolio of attachment solutions and provided a meaningful platform for growth. The results of IES Attachments subsequent to the date of acquisition are included in the Company's Industrial segment.\nThe IES Attachments acquisition was accounted for as a business combination using the acquisition method of accounting, which requires, among other things, certain assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recognized at their fair values as of the acquisition date. The estimated acquisition date value of identifiable net assets acquired, which included $\n77.8\nmillion of working capital (primarily inventory), $\n78.3\nmillion of deferred tax liabilities, and $\n328.0\nmillion of intangible assets, was $\n342.2\nmillion. The related goodwill was $\n311.3\nmillion. The amount allocated to intangible assets included $\n304.0\nmillion for customer relationships. The weighted-average useful life assigned to the intangible assets was\n14\nyears.\nGoodwill was calculated as the excess of the consideration transferred over the net assets recognized and represents the expected cost synergies of the combined business and assembled workforce. It is estimated that $\n2.4\nmillion of goodwill, relating to the pre-acquisition historical tax basis of goodwill, will be deductible for tax purposes.\nThe acquisition accounting for IES Attachments is complete. The measurement period adjustments recorded in 2020 did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOther 2019 Acquisitions\nDuring 2019, the Company completed\ntwo\nother acquisitions for $\n32.4\nmillion, net of cash acquired. The estimated acquisition date value of the identifiable net assets acquired, which included $\n6.3\nmillion of working capital and $\n4.4\nmillion of customer relationships, was $\n15.7\nmillion. The related goodwill was $\n16.7\nmillion. The useful lives assigned to the customer relationships was\n10\nyears. The results of these acquisitions subsequent to the dates of acquisition are included in the Company's Industrial segment and Mechanical Access Solutions. The acquisition accounting for these acquisitions is complete. The measurement period adjustments recorded in 2020 did not have a material impact to the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.\nACTUAL AND PRO-FORMA IMPACT FROM ACQUISITIONS\nActual Impact from Acquisitions\nThe net sales and net loss from the 2021 acquisitions included in the Company's Consolidated Statements of Operations for the year ended January 1, 2022 are shown in the table below. The net loss includes amortization expense relating to intangible assets recorded upon acquisition, inventory step-up charges, transaction costs, gain on MTD investment, contingent consideration expense, and other integration-related costs.\nPro-forma Impact from Acquisitions\nThe following table presents supplemental pro-forma information as if the 2021 acquisitions had occurred on December 29, 2019 and the 2020 acquisitions had occurred on December 30, 2018. The pro-forma consolidated results are not necessarily indicative of what the Company’s consolidated net sales and net earnings would have been had the Company completed the acquisitions on the aforementioned dates. In addition, the pro-forma consolidated results do not purport to project the future results of the Company.\n86\n2021 Pro-forma Results\nThe 2021 pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of Stanley Black & Decker with the stand-alone results of the 2021 acquisitions for their respective pre-acquisition periods. Accordingly, the following adjustments were made:\n•\nElimination of the historical pre-acquisition intangible asset amortization expense and the addition of intangible asset amortization expense related to intangibles valued as part of the acquisition accounting that would have been incurred from January 2, 2021 to the acquisition dates.\n•\nBecause the 2021 acquisitions were assumed to occur on December 29, 2019, there were no acquisition-related costs or inventory step-up charges factored into the 2021 pro-forma year, as such expenses would have occurred in the first year following the assumed acquisition date.\n•\nBecause the MTD acquisition was assumed to occur on December 29, 2019, the gain on investment and contingent consideration expense was not factored into the 2021 pro-forma year, as such gain and expense would have occurred in the first year following the assumed acquisition date.\n2020 Pro-forma Results\nThe 2020 pro-forma results were calculated by combining the results of Stanley Black & Decker with the stand-alone results of the 2020 and 2021 acquisitions for their respective pre-acquisition periods. Accordingly, the following adjustments were made:\n•\nElimination of the historical pre-acquisition intangible asset amortization expense and the addition of intangible asset amortization expense related to intangibles valued as part of the acquisition accounting that would have been incurred from December 29, 2019 to the acquisition dates of the 2020 acquisition and for the year ended January 2, 2021 for the 2021 acquisitions.\n•\nAdditional depreciation expense for the property, plant, and equipment fair value adjustment that would have been incurred from December 29, 2019 to the acquisition date of CAM.\n•\nAdditional expense for acquisition-related costs and inventory step-up charges relating to the 2021 acquisitions, as such expenses would have been incurred during the year ended January 2, 2021.\n•\nAdditional gain on investment and contingent consideration expense relating to the MTD acquisition, as such gain and expense would have been incurred during the year ended January 2, 2021.\n•\nBecause the 2020 acquisitions were assumed to occur on December 30, 2018, there were no acquisition-related costs or inventory step-up charges factored into the 2020 pro-forma period, as such expenses would have occurred in the first year following the assumed acquisition date.\nINVESTMENTS\nDuring 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company made additional immaterial investments in new and emerging start-up companies focused on innovation, breakthrough products and advanced technologies. These investments, which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, do not qualify for equity method accounting as the Company acquired less than 20 percent interest in each investment and does not have the ability to significantly influence the operating or financial decisions of any of the investees.\nF.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nGOODWILL —\nThe changes in the carrying amount of goodwill by segment are as follows:\n87\nGoodwill totaling $\n1,894.5\nmillion and $\n1,951.6\nmillion was reclassed to assets held for sale as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nThe goodwill amount for the 2021 acquisitions is subject to change based upon the finalization of the acquisition accounting during the measurement period. Refer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments\n, for further discussion.\nIn accordance with ASC 350,\nIntangibles - Goodwill and Other\n, a portion of the goodwill within Other was allocated to the aforementioned sale of the commercial electronic security business in\nfive\ncountries in Europe and emerging markets based on the relative fair value of the business disposed of and the portion of the reporting unit that was retained.  Accordingly, goodwill for the Security segment was reduced by $\n31.3\nmillion and included in the gain on sale of this divestiture in 2020. Refer to\nNote T, Divestitures\n, for further discussion.\nAs required by the Company's policy, goodwill and indefinite-lived trade names were tested for impairment in the third quarter of 2021. The Company assessed the fair values of three of its reporting units utilizing a discounted cash flow valuation model and determined that the fair values exceeded the respective carrying amounts. The key assumptions used were discount rates and perpetual growth rates applied to cash flow projections. Also inherent in the discounted cash flow valuations were near-term revenue growth rates over the next six years. These assumptions contemplated business, market and overall economic conditions. For the remaining two reporting units, the Company determined qualitatively that it was not more likely than not that goodwill was impaired, and thus, the quantitative goodwill impairment test was not required.  In making this determination, the Company considered the significant excess of fair value over carrying amount as calculated in the most recent quantitative analysis, each reporting unit's 2021 performance compared to prior year and their respective industries, analyst multiples and other positive qualitative information. Based on the results of the annual impairment testing performed in the third quarter of 2021, the Company determined that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nINTANGIBLE ASSETS —\nIntangible assets at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were as follows:\nNet intangibles totaling $\n177.8\nmillionand $\n217.7\nmillion were reclassed to assets held for sale as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nIndefinite-lived trade names totaled $\n2.525\nbillion at January 1, 2022 and $\n2.195\nbillion at January 2, 2021. The year-over-year change is primarily due to the indefinite-lived trade names acquired in the MTD acquisition.\nThe fair values of the Company's indefinite-lived trade names were assessed using quantitative analyses, which utilized discounted cash flow valuation models taking into consideration appropriate discount rates, royalty rates and perpetual growth\n88\nrates applied to projected sales. The Company determined that the fair values of its indefinite-lived trade names exceeded their respective carrying amounts.\nIntangible assets amortization expense by segment was as follows:\nThe amounts above are inclusive of amortization expense for discontinued operations amounting to $\n38.4\nmillion in 2021,\n$\n42.8\nmillion in 2020, and $\n44.4\nmillion in 2019.\nFuture amortization expense in each of the next five years amounts to $\n206.3\nmillion for 2022, $\n199.0\nmillion for 2023, $\n192.8\nmillion for 2024, $\n176.7\nmillion for 2025, $\n163.2\nmillion for 2026 and $\n1,236.8\nmillion thereafter.\nG.\nACCRUED EXPENSES\nAccrued expenses at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were as follows:\nH.\nLONG-TERM DEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\n89\nLong-term debt and financing arrangements at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were as follows:\n1\nUnamortized gain (loss) associated with interest rate swaps are more fully discussed in\nNote I, Financial Instruments.\nIncluded in the table above, during the fourth quarter of 2021, the Company assumed $\n103.0\nmillion and $\n4.3\nmillion of long-term debt from the acquisition of MTD and Excel, respectively. Principal amounts and maturities are also included in the figures below.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the total aggregate annual principal maturities of long-term debt for the next five years and thereafter are as follows: $\n1.3\nmillion in 2022, $\n1.2\nmillion in 2023, $\n1.1\nmillion in 2024, $\n0.5\nmillion in 2025, $\n553.7\nmillion in 2026, and $\n3.850\nbillion thereafter. These maturities represent the principal amounts to be paid and accordingly exclude the remaining $\n6.8\nmillion of unamortized fair value adjustments made in purchase accounting, which increased the Black & Decker note payable due 2028, as well as a net loss of $\n25.7\nmillion pertaining to unamortized termination gains and losses on interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts on the notes as described in\nNote I, Financial Instruments,\nand $\n34.0\nmillion of unamortized deferred financing fees. Interest paid during 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounted t\no $\n177.3\nmillion, $\n192.1\nmillion and $\n252.9\nmillion, respectively.\nIn November 2020, the Company issued $\n750.0\nmillion of senior unsecured term notes maturing November 15, 2050 (\"2050 Term Notes\"). The 2050 Term Notes will accrue interest at a fixed rate of\n2.75\n% per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears, and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured unsubordinated debt. The Company received total proceeds from this offering of approximately $\n739.9\nmillion, net of approximately $\n10.1\nmillion of underwriting expenses and other fees associated with the transaction. The Company used the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate purposes, including repayment of other borrowings.\nContemporaneously with the issuance of the 2050 Term Notes, the Company redeemed the\n3.4\n% senior unsecured term notes due 2021 (“2021 Term Notes”) and the\n2.9\n% senior unsecured term notes due 2022 (“2022 Term Notes”) for approximately $\n1.2\nbillion representing the outstanding principal amounts, accrued and unpaid interest, and a make-whole premium. The Company recognized a net pre-tax loss of $\n46.9\nmillion from the extinguishment, which was comprised of the $\n48.7\nmillion make-whole premium payment and a $\n1.7\nmillion loss related to the write-off of deferred financing fees, partially offset by a $\n3.5\nmillion gain relating to the write-off of unamortized fair value swap terminations.  The Company also recognized a pre-tax loss of $\n19.6\nmillion relating to the unamortized loss on cash flow swap terminations related to the 2022 Term Notes. Refer to\nNote I, Financial Instruments\n, for further discussion.\nIn February 2020, the Company issued $\n750.0\nmillion of senior unsecured term notes maturing March 15, 2030 (\"2030 Term Notes\") and $\n750.0\nmillion of fixed-to-fixed reset rate junior subordinated debentures maturing March 15, 2060 (“2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures”). The 2030 Term Notes accrue interest at a fixed rate of\n2.3\n% per annum, with interest payable semi-annually in arrears, and rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company's existing and future unsecured and\n90\nunsubordinated debt. The 2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures bear interest at a fixed rate of\n4.0\n% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears, up to but excluding March 15, 2025. From and including March 15, 2025, the interest rate will be reset for each subsequent five-year reset period equal to the Five-Year Treasury Rate plus\n2.657\n%.  The Five-Year Treasury Rate is based on the average yields on actively traded U.S. treasury securities adjusted to constant maturity, for five-year maturities.  On each five-year reset date, the 2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures can be called at\n100\n% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any. The 2060 Junior Subordinated Debentures are unsecured and rank subordinate and junior in right of payment to all of the Company’s existing and future senior debt. The Company received total net proceeds from these offerings of approximately $\n1.483\nbillion, net of underwriting expenses and other fees associated with the transactions. The net proceeds from these offerings were used for general corporate purposes, including acquisition funding.\nIn December 2013, the Company issued $\n400.0\nmillion aggregate principal amount of\n5.75\n% fixed-to-floating rate junior subordinated debentures maturing December 15, 2053 (“2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures”). The 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures bore interest at a fixed rate of\n5.75\n% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears to, but excluding December 15, 2018. From and including December 15, 2018, the 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures bore interest at an annual rate equal to three-month LIBOR plus\n4.304\n%, payable quarterly in arrears. In February 2019, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures for $\n405.7\nmillion, which represented\n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the redemption date. The Company recognized a net pre-tax loss of $\n3.2\nmillion from the redemption, which was comprised of a $\n7.8\nmillion loss related to the write-off of deferred financing fees partially offset by a $\n4.6\nmillion gain relating to an unamortized terminated interest rate swap as described in more detailed in\nNote I, Financial Instruments\n.\nIn July 2012, the Company issued $\n750.0\nmillion of junior subordinated debentures, maturing on July 25, 2052 (“2052 Junior Subordinated Debentures”) with fixed interest payable quarterly, in arrears, at a rate of\n5.75\n% per annum. In December 2019, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2052 Junior Subordinated Debentures for $\n760.5\nmillion, which represented\n100\n% of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest. The Company recognized a pre-tax loss of $\n17.9\nmillion from the redemption related to the write-off of unamortized deferred financing fees.\nCommercial Paper and Credit Facilities\nIn October 2021, the Company increased its commercial paper program from $\n3.0\nbillion to $\n3.5\nbillion, which includes Euro denominated borrowings in addition to U.S. Dollars. As of January 1, 2022, the Company had\n$\n2.2\nbillion of\nborrowings outstanding. As of January 2, 2021, the Company had\nno\nborrowings outstanding, Refer to\nNote I, Financial Instruments,\nfor further discussion.\nIn September 2021, the Company amended and restated its existing\nfive-year\n$\n2.0\nbillion committed credit facilit\ny with the concurrent execution of a new\nfive year\n$\n2.5\nbillion co\nmmitted credit facility (the \"\n5\n-year Credit Agreement\"). Borrowings under the\n5\n-Year Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars, Euros or Pounds Sterling. A sub-limit amount of $\n814.3\nmillion is designated for swing line advances which may be drawn in Euros pursuant to the terms of the\n5\n-Year Credit Agreement. Borrowings bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the\nborrowing and specific terms of the\n5\n-Year Credit Agreement. The Company must repay all advances under the\n5\n-Year Credit Agreement by the earlier of September 8, 2026 or upon termination. The\n5\n-Year Credit Agreement is designated to be a liquidity back-stop for the Company's $\n3.5\nbillion U.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had not drawn on its\nfive-year\ncommitted credit facility.\nIn September 2021, the Company terminated its\n364\n-day $\n1.0\nbillion credit facility and concurrently executed a new\n364\n-Day $\n1.0\nbillion committed credit facility (the \"\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement\"). Borrowings under the\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars or Euros and bear interest at a floating rate plus an applicable margin dependent upon the denomination of the borrowing and pursuant to the terms of the\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement. The Company must repay all advances under the\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement by the earlier\nof September 7, 2022 or u\npon termination. The Company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first anniversary of the termination date provided that the Company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. The\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement serves as part of the liquidity back-stop for the Compan\ny’s $\n3.5\nbillion U\n.S. Dollar and Euro commercial paper program. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had\nno\nt drawn on this\n364\n-Day committed credit facility.\nIn November 2021, the Company executed a second\n364\n-Day $\n1.0\nbillion committed credit facility (the \"Second\n364\n-Day Credit A\ngreement\"). Borrowings under the Second\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement may be made in U.S. Dollars and Euros and bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin determined at the time of borrowing. The Company must repay all advances under the Second\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement by the earlier of November 15, 2022 or upon termination. The Company may, however, convert all advances outstanding upon termination into a term loan that shall be repaid in full no later than the first\n91\nanniversary of the termination date provided that the Company, among other things, pays a fee to the administrative agent for the account of each lender. As of January 1, 2022, the Company had not drawn on this\n364\n-Day committed credit facility.\nIn January 2022, the Company executed a third\n364\n-Day $\n2.5\nbillion committed credit facility (the \"Third\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement\").  Borrowings under the Third\n364\n-Day Credit Agreement shall be made in U.S. Dollars and bear interest at a base rate plus an applicable margin determined at the time of the borrowing.

Short-term arrangements are reviewed annually for renewal.\nAt January 1, 2022, the aggregate amount of committed and uncommitted lines of credit, long-term and short-term, was approximatel\ny $\n4.9\nbillion. At January 1, 2022, $\n2.2\nbillion was recorded as short-term borrowings. In addition, $\n90.9\nmillion of the short-term credit lines was utilized primarily pertaining to outstanding letters of credit for which there are no required or reported debt balances. The weight\ned-average interest rates on U.S. dollar denominated short-term borrowings for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were\n0.1\n%\nand\n1.3\n%, respectively. The weighted-average interest rates on Euro denominated short-term borrowings for the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were negativ\ne\n0.5\n%\nand\n0.2\n%, respectively.\nI.\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices and commodity prices. As part of the Company’s risk management program, a variety of financial instruments such as interest rate swaps, currency swaps, purchased currency options, foreign exchange contracts and commodity contracts, may be used to mitigate interest rate exposure, foreign currency exposure and commodity price exposure.\nIf the Company elects to do so and if the instrument meets the criteria specified in ASC 815, management designates its derivative instruments as cash flow hedges, fair value hedges or net investment hedges. Generally, commodity price exposures are not hedged with derivative financial instruments and instead are actively managed through customer pricing initiatives, procurement-driven cost reduction initiatives and other productivity improvement projects. Financial instruments are not utilized for speculative purposes.\nA summary of the fair values of the Company’s derivatives recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 follows:\nThe counterparties to all of the above mentioned financial instruments are major international financial institutions. The Company is exposed to credit risk for net exchanges under these agreements, but not for the notional amounts. The credit risk is limited to the asset amounts noted above. The Company limits its exposure and concentration of risk by contracting with\n92\ndiverse financial institutions and does not anticipate non-performance by any of its counterparties. Further, as more fully discussed in\nNote M, Fair Value Measurements\n, the Company considers non-performance risk of its counterparties at each reporting period and adjusts the carrying value of these assets accordingly. The risk of default is considered remote. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, there were no assets that had been posted as collateral related to the above mentioned financial instruments.\nIn 2021 cash flows related to derivatives, including those that are separately discussed below, resulted in net cash paid of $\n166.8\nmillion, and in 2020 and 2019, cash flows related to derivatives resulted in net cash received of  $\n33.4\nmillion and $\n69.9\nmillion, respectively.\nCASH FLOW HEDGES —\nThere were after-tax mark-to-market losses of $\n49.8\nmillion and $\n103.0\nmillion as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively, reported for cash flow hedge effectiveness in Accumulated other comprehensive loss. An after-tax gain of $\n11.1\nmillion is expected to be reclassified to earnings as the hedged transactions occur or as amounts are amortized within the next twelve months. The ultimate amount recognized will vary based on fluctuations of the hedged currencies and interest rates through the maturity dates.\nThe tables below detail pre-tax amounts of derivatives designated as cash flow hedges in Accumulated other comprehensive loss during the periods in which the underlying hedged transactions affected earnings for 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nA summary of the pre-tax effect of cash flow hedge accounting on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\n1\nInclusive of the gain/loss amortization on terminated derivative financial instruments.\n93\nFor 2021, 2020 and 2019 after-tax losses of $\n17.0\nmillion, $\n15.4\nmillion, and $\n13.1\nmillion, respectively, were reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss into earnings (inclusive of the gain/loss amortization on terminated derivative financial instruments) during the periods in which the underlying hedged transactions affected earnings.\nInterest Rate Contracts:\nThe Company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to obtain the lowest cost source of funds within a targeted range of variable to fixed-rate debt proportions. During 2021, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps totaling $\n400.0\nmillion to offset expected variability on future interest rate payments associated with debt instruments expected to be issued in the future.\nDuring 2020, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps totaling $\n1.0\nbillion to offset expected variability on future interest rate payments associated with debt instruments expected to be issued in the future. The Company terminated these swaps in 2020 resulting in a loss of $\n20.5\nmillion, which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to interest expense over future periods.\nDuring 2019, the Company entered into forward starting interest rate swaps totaling $\n650.0\nmillion to offset expected variability on future interest rate payments associated with debt instruments expected to be issued in the future. During 2019, swaps with a notional amount of $\n250.0\nmillion matured resulting in a loss of $\n1.0\nmillion, which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss and is being amortized to earnings as interest expense over future periods. During 2021, the remaining notional amount of $\n400.0\nmillion matured resulting in a loss of $\n75.3\nmillion, which was recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive loss, and will be amortized to interest expense over future periods.\nThe cash flows stemming from the maturity and termination of such interest rate swaps designated as cash flow hedges discussed above are presented within other financing activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nIn December 2020, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2021 Term Notes and 2022 Term Notes, as further discussed in\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements.\nAs a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax loss of $\n19.6\nmillion relating to the remaining unamortized loss on cash flow swap terminations related to the 2022 Term Notes.\nAs of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had $\n400.0\nmillion of forward starting swaps outstanding.\nForeign Currency Contracts\nForward Contracts:\nThrough its global businesses, the Company enters into transactions and makes investments denominated in multiple currencies that give rise to foreign currency risk. The Company and its subsidiaries regularly purchase inventory from subsidiaries with functional currencies different than their own, which creates currency-related volatility in the Company’s results of operations. The Company utilizes forward contracts to hedge these forecasted purchases and sales of inventory. Gains and losses reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recorded in Cost of sales as the hedged item affects earnings. There are no components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for these contracts. At January 1, 2022, and January 2, 2021, the notional values of the forward currency contracts outstanding was $\n512.1\nmillion and $\n595.8\nmillion, respectively, maturing on various dates through 2022.\nIn January 2022, the Company entered into forward currency contracts with notional values totaling $\n100.0\nmillion maturing on various dates in 2022.\nPurchased Option Contracts:\nThe Company and its subsidiaries have entered into various intercompany transactions whereby the notional values are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the party executing the trade. In order to better match the cash flows of its intercompany obligations with cash flows from operations, the Company enters into purchased option contracts. Gains and losses reclassified from Accumulated other comprehensive loss are recorded in Cost of sales as the hedged item affects earnings. There are no components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness for these contracts. At January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 there were no outstanding option contracts.\nFAIR VALUE HEDGES\nInterest Rate Risk:\nIn an effort to optimize the mix of fixed versus floating rate debt in the Company’s capital structure, the Company enters into interest rate swaps. In prior years, the Company entered into interest rate swaps related to certain of its notes payable which were subsequently terminated.  Amortization of the gain/loss on previously terminated swaps is reported as a reduction of interest expense. Prior to termination, the changes in fair value of the swaps and the offsetting changes in fair\n94\nvalue related to the underlying notes were recognized in earnings. The Company did not have any active fair value interest rate swaps at January 1, 2022 or January 2, 2021.\nA summary of the pre-tax effect of fair value hedge accounting on the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nIn December 2020, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2021 Term Notes and 2022 Term Notes, as further discussed in\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements.\nAs a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n3.5\nmillion relating to the remaining unamortized gain on fair value swap terminations related to the 2021 Term Notes.\nIn February 2019, the Company redeemed all of the outstanding 2053 Junior Subordinated Debentures, as further discussed in\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements.\nAs a result, the Company recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n4.6\nmillion relating to the remaining unamortized gain on swap termination related to this debt.\nA summary of the amounts recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges as of 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\n1\nRepresents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships.\n1\nRepresents hedged items no longer designated in qualifying fair value hedging relationships.\nNET INVESTMENT HEDGES\nForeign Exchange Contracts:\nThe Company utilizes net investment hedges to offset the translation adjustment arising from re-measurement of its investment in the assets and liabilities of its foreign subsidiaries. The total after-tax amounts in Accumulated other comprehensive gains of $\n71.8\nmillion and $\n72.8\nmillion at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company had a foreign exchange contract with a notional values of $\n75.0\nmillion maturing in 2022 hedging a portion of its Taiwan dollar denominated net investments and a cross currency swap with a notional value of $\n100.0\nmillion maturing in 2023 hedging a portion of its Japanese yen denominated net investments.\nAs of January 2, 2021, the Company had cross currency swaps with a notional value totaling $\n839.4\nmillion maturing on various dates through 2023 hedging a portion of its Japanese yen, Euro and Swiss franc denominated net investments.\nMaturing foreign exchange contracts resulted in net cash paid of $\n55.1\nmillion in 2021, and net cash received of $\n41.0\nmillion, and $\n8.0\nmillion during 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nGains and losses on net investment hedges remain in Accumulated other comprehensive loss until disposal of the underlying assets. Gains and losses representing components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in earnings in Other, net on a straight-line basis over the term of the hedge. Gains and losses after a hedge has been de-designated are recorded directly to the Consolidated Statements of Operations in Other, net.\n95\nThe pre-tax gains and losses from fair value changes during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\nUNDESIGNATED HEDGES\nForeign Exchange Contracts:\nCurrency swaps and foreign exchange forward contracts are used to reduce risks arising from the change in fair value of certain foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities (such as affiliate loans, payables and receivables). The objective of these practices is to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on operating results. The total notional amount of the forward contracts outstanding at January 1, 2022 was $\n1.2\nbillion maturing on various dates through 2022. The total notional amount of the forward contracts outstanding at January 2, 2021 was $\n1.3\nbillion maturing on various dates through 2021.\nThe gain (loss) recorded in the consolidated statements of operations from changes in the fair value related to derivatives not designated as hedging instruments under ASC 815 for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n96\nJ.\nCAPITAL STOCK\nEARNINGS PER SHARE —\nThe following table reconciles net earnings attributable to common shareowners and the weighted-average shares outstanding used to calculate basic and diluted earnings per share for the fiscal years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019.\nThe following weighted-average stock options were not included in the computation of weighted-average diluted shares outstanding because the effect would be anti-dilutive (in thousands):\nIn November 2019, the Company issued\n7,500,000\nEquity Units with a total notional value of $\n750.0\nmillion (\n“\n2019 Equity Units”). Each unit has a stated amount of $\n100\nand initial\nly consists\nof a\nthree-year\nforward stock purchase contract (\n“\n2022 Purchase Contracts”) for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on November 15, 2022, for a price of $\n100\nand a\n10\n% beneficial ownership interest in one share of\n0\n% Series D Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share (\n“\nSeries D Preferred Stock”). On and after November 15, 2022, the Series D Preferred Stock may be converted into common stock at the option of the holder.  At the election of the Company, upon conversion, the Company may deliver cash, common stock, or a combination thereof.  The conversio\nn rate was init\nially\n5.2263\nshares of common stock per one share of Series D Preferred Stock, which was equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately $\n191.34\nper share of common stock.  As of January 1, 2022, due to customary anti-dilution provisions, the conversion rate was\n5.2330\n, equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $\n191.10\nper share of common stock. The Series D Preferred Stock is excluded from the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation on the basis that the Series D Preferred Stock will be settled in cash except to the extent that the conversion value exceeds its liquidation preference. Therefore, before any redemption or conversion, the common shares that would be required to settle the applicable conversion\n97\nvalue in excess of liquidation preference are included in the denominator of diluted earnings per share in periods in which they are dilutive.\nIn May 2017, the Company issued\n7,500,000\nEquity Units with a total notional value of  $\n750.0\nmillion (\n“\n2017 Equity Units”). Each unit had a stated amount of $\n100\nand initially consisted of a\nthree-year\nforward stock purchase contract (\n“\n2020 Purchase Contracts”) for the purchase of a variable number of shares of common stock, on May 15, 2020, for a price of $\n100\n, and a\n10\n% beneficial ownership interest in one share of\n0\n% Series C Cumulative Perpetual Convertible Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share (\n“\nSeries C Preferred Stock”).\nThe Shares associated with the forward stock purchase contracts component of the 2019 Equity Units and 2017 Equity Units have been reflected in diluted earnings per share using the if-converted method pursuant to paragraph 260-10-45-40 of ASC 260,\nEarnings per share\n.\nIn May 2020, the Company successfully remarketed the Series C Preferred Stock (the\n“\nRemarketed Series C Preferred Stock”) resulting in cash proceeds of $\n750.0\nmillion. Upon completion of the remarketing, the holders of the 2017 Equity Units received\n5,463,750\ncommon shares and the Company issued\n750,000\nshares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share. Holders of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock were entitled to receive cumulative dividends, if declared by the Board of Directors, at an initial fixed rate equal to\n5.0\n% per annum of the $\n1,000\nper share liquidation preference (equivalent to $\n50.00\nper annum per share). Beginning on May 15, 2020, the holders had the option to convert the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock into common stock. At the election of the Company, upon conversion, the Company may deliver cash, common stock, or a combination thereof. In connection with the remarketing described above, the conversion rate was reset to\n6.7352\nshares of the Company's common stock per one share of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, which was equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $\n148.47\nper share of common stock.\nOn April 28, 2021, the Company informed holders that it would redeem all outstanding shares of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock on June 3, 2021 (the\n“\nRedemption Date”) at $\n1,002.50\nper share in cash (the\n“\nRedemption Price”) which was equal to\n100\n% of the liquidation preference of a share of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. If a holder elected to convert its shares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock prior to the Redemption Date, the Company elected a combination settlement with a specified cash amount of $\n1,000\nper share. In June 2021, the Company redeemed the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock and settled all conversions, paying $\n750\nmillion in cash and issuing\n1,469,055\ncommon shares. The conversion rate used was\n6.7548\n(equivalent to a conversion price set at $\n148.04\nper common share). Prior to the Redemption Date, the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock was excluded from the denominator of the diluted earnings per share calculation on the basis that the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock would be settled in cash except to the extent that the conversion value exceeded its liquidation preference. Therefore, before any redemption or conversion, the common shares that would be required to settle the applicable conversion value in excess of the liquidation preference were included in the denominator of diluted earnings per share in periods in which they were dilutive.\nSee\n“\nOther Equity Arrangements” below for further details of the above transactions.\nCOMMON STOCK ACTIVITY —\nCommon stock activity for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows:\nUpon completion of the remarketing of the Series C Preferred Stock in May 2020, the holders of the 2017 Equity Units received\n5,463,750\nshares of common stock and the Company issued\n750,000\nshares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock.\nIn March 2015, the Company entered into a forward share purchase contract with a financial institution counterparty for\n3,645,510\nshares of common stock. The contract obligates the Company to pay $\n350.0\nmillion, plus an additional amount related to the forward component of the contract. In February 2020, the Company amended the settlement date to April 2022, or earlier at the Company's option. The reduction of common shares outstanding was recorded at the inception of the forward share purchase contract in March 2015 and factored into the calculation of weighted-average shares outstanding at that time.\n98\nCOMMON STOCK RESERVED —\nCommon stock shares reserved for issuance under various employee and director stock plans at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 are as follows:\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS —\nThe Company has stock-based compensation plans for salaried employees and non-employee members of the Board of Directors. The plans provide for discretionary grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based awards.\nThe plans are generally administered by the Compensation and Talent Development Committee of the Board of Directors, consisting of non-employee directors.\nStock Option Valuation Assumptions:\nStock options are granted at the fair market value of the Company’s stock on the date of grant and have a\n10-year\nterm. Generally, stock option grants vest ratably over\n4\nyears from the date of grant.\nThe following describes how certain assumptions affecting the estimated fair value of stock options are determined: the dividend yield is computed as the annualized dividend rate at the date of grant divided by the strike price of the stock option; expected volatility is based on an average of the market implied volatility and historical volatility for the\n5.25 year\nexpected life; the risk-free interest rate is based on U.S. Treasury securities with maturities equal to the expected life of the option; and a\neight\npercent forfeiture rate is assumed. The Company uses historical data in order to estimate forfeitures and holding period behavior for valuation purposes.\nThe fair value of stock option grants is estimated on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to value grants made in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nStock Options:\nThe number of stock options and weighted-average exercise prices as of January 1, 2022 are as follows:\nAt January 1, 2022, the range of exercise prices on outstanding stock options was $\n70.61\nto $\n193.97\n. Stock option expense was $\n36.4\nmillion, $\n31.6\nmillion and $\n27.7\nmillion for the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019, respectively. At January 1, 2022, the Company had $\n73.9\nmillion of unrecognized pre-tax compensation expense for stock options. This expense will be recognized over the remaining vesting periods which are\n1.9\nyears on a weighted-average basis.\nDuring 2021, the Company received $\n117.5\nmillion in cash from the exercise of stock options. The related cash tax benefit from the exercise of these options was $\n19.7\nmillion. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the total intrinsic value of options exercised\n99\nwas $\n85.3\nmillion, $\n104.3\nmillion and $\n143.7\nmillion, respectively. When options are exercised, the related shares are issued from treasury stock.\nAn excess tax benefit is generated on the extent to which the actual gain, or spread, an optionee receives upon exercise of an option exceeds the fair value determined at the grant date; that excess spread over the fair value of the option times the applicable tax rate represents the excess tax benefit. During 2021, 2020 and 2019, the excess tax benefit arising from tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost totaled $\n14.1\nmillion, $\n17.6\nmillion and $\n25.8\nmillion, respectively, and was recorded in income tax expense.\nOutstanding and exercisable stock option information at January 1, 2022 follows:\nCompensation cost for new grants is recognized on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The expense for retirement eligible employees (those aged\n55\nand over and with\n10\nor more years of service) is recognized by the date they become retirement eligible, as such employees may retain their options for the\n10\nyear contractual term in the event they retire prior to the end of the vesting period stipulated in the grant.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the aggregate intrinsic value of stock options outstanding and stock options exercisable was $\n211.7\nmillion and $\n173.5\nmillion, respectively.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan:\nThe Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) enables eligible employees in the United States, Canada and Israel to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at the lower of\n85.0\n% of the fair market value of the shares on the grant date ($\n150.40\nper share for fiscal year 2021 purchases) or\n85.0\n% of the fair market value of the shares on the last business day of each month. A maximum of\n1,600,000\nshares are authorized for subscription. In conjunction with the Company’s cost savings initiatives, the ESPP was temporarily suspended in 2019 and was subsequently reinstated in 2020. During 2021, 2020 and 2019,\n92,307\nshares,\n119,038\nshares and\n12,465\nshares, respectively, were issued under the plan at average prices of $\n150.21\n, $\n110.97\n, and $\n103.02\nper share, respectively, and the intrinsic value of the ESPP purchases was $\n3.9\nmillion, $\n3.3\nmillion and $\n0.3\nmillion, respectively. For 2021, the Company received $\n13.9\nmillion in cash from ESPP purchases, and there was no related tax benefit. The fair value of ESPP shares was estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. ESPP compensation cost is recognized ratably over the\none year\nterm based on actual employee stock purchases under the plan. The fair value of the employees’ purchase rights under the ESPP was estimated using the following assumptions for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively: dividend yield of\n1.6\n%,\n1.7\n% and\n2.2\n%; expected volatility of\n55.0\n%,\n28.0\n% and\n28.0\n%; risk-free interest rates of\n0.1\n%,\n1.6\n%, and\n2.5\n%; and expected lives of\none year\n. The weighted-average fair value of those purchase rights granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n45.46\n, $\n41.02\nand $\n27.75\n, respectively. Total compensation expense recognized for ESPP was $\n4.4\nmillion in 2021, $\n3.9\nmillion in 2020 and de minimus in 2019.\nRestricted Share Units and Awards:\nCompensation cost for restricted share units and awards, including restricted shares granted to French employees in lieu of RSUs, (collectively “RSUs”) granted to employees is recognized ratably over the vesting term, which varies but is generally\n4\nyears. RSU grants totaled\n463,084\nshares,\n325,448\nshares and\n282,598\nshares in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n193.66\n, $\n165.44\nand $\n149.14\nper share, respectively.\nTotal compensation expense recognized for RSUs amounted to $\n47.3\nmillion, $\n35.6\nmillion and $\n41.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The actual tax benefit received related to the shares that were delivered in 2021 was $\n10.4\nmillion. The excess tax benefit recognized was $\n2.5\nmillion, $\n2.3\nmillion, and $\n3.2\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of January 1, 2022, unrecognized compensation expense for RSUs amounted to $\n117.2\nmillion and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n2\nyears.\n100\nA summary of non-vested restricted stock unit and award activity as of January 1, 2022, and changes during the twelve month period then ended is as follows:\nThe total fair value of shares vested (market value on the date vested) during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n53.3\nmillion, $\n58.5\nmillion and $\n56.7\nmillion, respectively.\nPrior to 2020, non-employee members of the Board of Directors received annual restricted share-based grants which must be cash settled and accordingly mark-to-market accounting is applied. In 2021, 2020 and 2019 the Company recognized $\n1.1\nmillion, $\n1.6\nmillion and $\n6.8\nmillion of expense for these awards, respectively. Beginning in 2020, the annual grant issued to non-employee members of the Board of Directors will be stock settled.  The expense related to the annual grant in 2021 and 2020 was $\n2.0\nmillion and $\n1.4\nmillion, respectively.  Additionally, members of the Board of Directors were granted restricted share units for which compensation expense of $\n1.4\nmillion, $\n1.0\nmillion, and $\n1.2\nmillion was recognized for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nManagement Incentive Compensation Plan Performance Stock Units:\nIn 2020 and 2019, the Company granted Performance Stock Units (collectively \"MICP-PSUs\") under the Management Incentive Compensation Plan (\"MICP\") to participating employees.  Awards are payable in shares of common stock and generally no award is made if the employee terminates employment prior to the settlement dates.  The ultimate delivery of the shares related to the 2020 and 2019 MICP-PSU grant will occur ratably in 2021, 2022, and 2023 for the 2020 plan and in 2020, 2021, and 2022 for the 2019 plan. The total shares to be delivered are based on actual 2020 and 2019 performance in relation to the established goals.\nA summary of the activity pertaining to the maximum number of shares that may be issued is as follows:\nCompensation cost for these performance awards is recognized ratably over the vesting term of\n3\nyears.  Total expense recognized in\n2021, 2020 and 2019\nrelated to these MICP-PSUs approximated\n$\n15.7\nmillion, $\n18.5\nmillion\nand $\n9.5\nmillion, respectively. The actual tax benefit received related to the shares that were delivered in\n2021 and 2020\nwas\n$\n5.6\nmillion a\nnd $\n1.9\nmillion, respectively.\nLong-Term Performance Awards:\nThe Company has granted Long-Term Performance Awards (“LTIP”) under its 2018 Omnibus Award Plan and 2013 Long Term Incentive Plan to senior management employees for achieving Company performance measures. Awards are payable in shares of common stock, which may be restricted if the employee has not achieved certain stock ownership levels, and generally no award is made if the employee terminates employment prior to the settlement date. LTIP grants were made in 2019, 2020 and 2021. Each grant has separate annual performance goals for each year within the respective\nthree year\nperformance period. Earnings per share and cash flow return on investment represent\n75\n% of the grant value. There is a third market-based metric, representing\n25\n% of the total grant, which measures the Company’s common stock return relative to peers over the performance period. The ultimate delivery of shares will occur in 2022, 2023, and 2024 for the 2019, 2020 and 2021 grants, respectively. Share settlements are based on actual performance in relation to these goals.\n101\nExpense recognized for these performance awards amounted to $\n11.1\nmillion in 2021, $\n17.1\nmillion in 2020, and $\n9.0\nmillion in 2019. With the exception of the market-based metric comprising\n25\n% of the award, in the event performance goals are not met, compensation cost is not recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed. The actual tax benefit received related to the shares that were delivered in 2021 and 2020 was $\n0.8\nmillion and $\n3.9\nmillion, respectively. The excess tax benefit recognized was $\n0.1\nmillion, $\n0.7\nmillion, and $\n1.5\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nA summary of the activity pertaining to the maximum number of shares that may be issued is as follows:\nOTHER EQUITY ARRANGEMENTS\n2019 Equity Units and Capped Call Transactions\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the 2019 Equity Units in November 2019, as further discussed above, the Company received approximately $\n734.5\nmillion in cash proceeds, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions. The proceeds were attributed to the issuance of\n750,000\nshares of Series D Preferred Stock for $\n620.3\nmillion and $\n114.2\nmillion for the present value of the quarterly payments to holders of the 2022 Purchase Contracts (“Contract Adjustment Payments”), as discussed further below. The proceeds were used, together with cash on hand, to redeem the 2052 Junior Subordinate Debentures in December 2019. The Company also used $\n19.2\nmillion of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions utilized to hedge potential economic dilution as described in more detail below.\nThe 2019 Equity Units are accounted for as one unit of account based on the economic linkage between the 2022 Purchase Contracts and Series D Preferred Stock, as well as the combination criteria outlined in ASC 815. The 2019 Equity Units represent mandatorily convertible preferred stock.\nIn November 2019, the Company issued\n750,000\nshares of Series D Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share. The convertible preferred stock will initially not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock will not accrete. The convertible preferred stock has no maturity date and will remain outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of shares of the convertible preferred stock will generally have no voting rights.\nThe Series D Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to support holders’ purchase obligations under the 2022 Purchase Contracts and will be remarketed. In connection with any successful remarketing, the Company may (but is not required to) modify certain terms of the convertible preferred stock, including the dividend rate, the conversion rate, and the earliest redemption date. After any successful remarketing in connection with which the dividend rate on the convertible preferred stock is increased, the Company will pay cumulative dividends on the convertible preferred stock, if declared by the Board of Directors, quarterly in arrears from the applicable remarketing settlement date.\nThe Company may not redeem the Series D Preferred Stock prior to December 22, 2022. At the election of the Company, on or after December 22, 2022, the Company may redeem for cash, all or any portion of the outstanding shares of the Series D Preferred Stock at a redemption price equal to\n100\n% of the liquidation preference, plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends. If the Company calls the Series D Preferred Stock for redemption, holders may convert their shares immediately preceding the redemption date.\nThe 2022 Purchase Contracts obligate the holders to purchase, on November 15, 2022, for a price of $\n100\nper share in cash, a maximum number of\n4.7\nmillion shares of the Company’s common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments).  The 2022 Purchase Contract holders may elect to settle their obligation early, in cash. The Series D Preferred Stock is pledged as collateral to guarantee the holders’ obligations to purchase common stock under the terms of the 2022 Purchase Contracts. The initial settlement rate determining the number of shares that each holder must purchase will not exceed the maximum settlement rate and is determined over a market value averaging period immediately preceding November 15, 2022.\n102\nThe initial maximum settlement rate of\n0.6272\nwas calculated using an initial reference price of $\n159.45\n, equal to the last reported sale price of the Company's common stock on November 7, 2019. As of January 1, 2022, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the maximum settlement rate was\n0.6280\n, equivalent to a reference price of $\n159.23\n. If the applicable market value of the Company's common stock is less than or equal to the reference price, the settlement rate will be the maximum settlement rate; and if the applicable market value of the Company's common stock is greater than the reference price, the settlement rate will be a number of shares of the Company's common stock equal to $\n100\nper share divided by the applicable market value. Upon a successful remarketing of the Series D Preferred Stock (the \"Remarketed Series D Preferred Stock\"), the Company will receive additional cash proceeds of $\n750\nmillion and issue shares of Remarketed Series D Preferred Stock.\nThe Company pays Contract Adjustment Payments to holders of the 2022 Purchase Contracts at a rate of\n5.25\n% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, which commenced on February 15, 2020. The $\n114.2\nmillion present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments reduced the Series D Preferred Stock at inception. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment is made, the related liability is reduced and the difference between the cash payment and the present value will accrete to interest expense, approximately $\n1.3\nmillion per year over the\nthree-year\nterm. As of January 1, 2022, the present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments was $\n38.3\nmillion.\nThe holders can settle the purchase contracts early, for cash, subject to certain exceptions and conditions in the prospectus supplement. Upon early settlement of any purchase contracts, the Company will deliver the number of shares of its common stock equal to\n85\n% of the number of shares of common stock that would have otherwise been deliverable.\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn order to offset the potential economic dilution associated with the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock, to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible preferred stock exceeds its liquidation preference, the Company entered into capped call transactions with\nthree\nmajor financial institutions.\nThe capped call transactions have a term of approximately\nthree years\nand are intended to cover the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock. Subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the capped call had an initial lower strike price of $\n191.34\n, which corresponded to the minimum\n5.2263\nsettlement rate of the Series D Preferred Stock, and an upper strike price of $\n207.29\n, which was approximately\n30\n% higher than the closing price of the Company’s common stock on November 7, 2019. As of January 1, 2022, due to the customary anti-dilution provisions, the capped call transactions were at an adjusted lower strike price of $\n191.10\nand an adjusted upper strike price of\n$\n207.02\n.\nThe capped call transactions may be settled by net share settlement (the default settlement method) or, at the Company’s option and subject to certain conditions, cash settlement, physical settlement or modified physical settlement. The number of shares the Company will receive will be determined by the terms of the contracts using a volume-weighted average price calculation for the market value of the Company's common stock, over an averaging period.  The market value determined will then be measured against the applicable strike price of the capped call transactions.  The Company expects the capped call transactions to offset the potential dilution upon conversion of the Series D Preferred Stock if the calculated market value is greater than the lower strike price but less than or equal to the upper strike price of the capped call transactions. Should the calculated market value exceed the upper strike price of the capped call transactions, the dilution mitigation will be limited based on such capped value as determined under the terms of the contracts.\nWith respect to the impact on the Company, the capped call transactions and 2019 Equity Units, when taken together, result in the economic equivalent of having the conversion price on the 2019 Equity Units at $\n207.02\n, the upper strike price of the capped call as of January 1, 2022.\nThe Company paid $\n19.2\nmillion, or an average of $\n4.90\nper option, to enter into capped call transactions on\n3.9\nmillion shares of common stock. The $\n19.2\nmillion premium paid was recorded as a reduction of Shareowners’ Equity. The aggregate fair value of the options at January 1, 2022 was $\n26.0\nmillion.\n2017 Equity Units and Capped Call Transactions\nIn conjunction with the issuance of the 2017 Equity Units in May 2017, as further discussed abo\nve, t\nhe Company received approximately $\n727.5\nmillion in cash proceeds, net of offering expenses and underwriting costs and commissions. The proceeds were attributed to the issuance of\n750,000\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock for $\n605.0\nmillion, $\n117.1\nmillion for the present value of the Contract Adjustment Payments, and a beneficial conversion feature of $\n5.4\nmillion. The proceeds were used for\n103\ngeneral corporate purposes, including repayment of short-term borrowings. The Company also used $\n25.1\nmillion of the proceeds to enter into capped call transactions utilized to hedge potential economic dilution as described in more detail below.\nThe 2017 Equity Units are accounted for as one unit of account based on the economic linkage between the 2020 Purchase Contracts and the Series C Preferred Stock, as well as the combination criteria outlined in ASC 815. The 2017 Equity Units represent mandatorily convertible preferred stock.\nIn May 2017, the Company issued\n750,000\nshares of Series C Preferred Stock, without par, with a liquidation preference of $\n1,000\nper share. The convertible preferred stock initially did not bear any dividends and the liquidation preference of the convertible preferred stock did not accrete. The convertible preferred stock had no maturity date and remained outstanding unless converted by holders or redeemed by the Company. Holders of shares of the convertible preferred stock generally had no voting rights. The Series C Preferred Stock was pledged as collateral to support holders’ purchase obligations under the 2020 Purchase Contracts.\nAs discussed further above, the Company successfully remarketed the Series C Preferred Stock in May 2020. Subsequent to the remarketing, holders of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock were entitled to receive, if declared by the Board of Directors, cumulative dividends (i) from, and including May 15, 2020 to, but excluding, May 15, 2023 (the \"dividend step-up date\n”\n) at a fixed rate equal to\n5.0\n% per annum of the $\n1,000\nper share liquidation preference (equivalent to $\n50.00\nper annum per share) and (ii) from, and including, the dividend step-up date at a fixed rate equal to\n10.0\n% per annum of the $\n1,000\nper share liquidation preference (equivalent to $\n100.00\nper annum per share). Dividends were cumulative on the $\n1,000\nliquidation preference per share and will be payable, if declared by the Board of Directors, quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15 of each year, beginning on August 15, 2020. Dividends accrued on the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock reduced net earnings for purposes of calculating earnings per share.\nThe Company did not have the right to redeem the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock prior to May 15, 2021. On April 28, 2021, the Company informed holders that it would redeem all outstanding shares of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock on June 3, 2021 (the\n“Redemption Date”) at\n$\n1,002.50\nper share in cash (the\n“\nRedemption Price\n”\n), which was equal to\n100\n% of the liquidation preference of a share of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, plus accumulated and unpaid dividends to, but excluding, the Redemption Date. If a holder elected to convert its shares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock prior to the Redemption Date, the Company elected a combination settlement with a specified cash amount of $\n1,000\nper share. In June 2021, the Company redeemed the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock and settled all conversions, paying $\n750\nmillion in cash and issuing\n1,469,055\ncommon shares. The conversion rate used was\n6.7548\n(equivalent to a conversion price set at $\n148.04\nper common share).\nThe Company generated cash proceeds of $\n750.0\nmillion from the successful remarketing of the Series C Preferred Stock. Upon completion of the remarketing in May 2020, the holders of the 2017 Equity Units received\n5,463,750\ncommon shares using the maximum settlement rate of\n0.7285\n(equivalent to a reference price of $\n137.26\nper common share), and the Company issued\n750,000\nshares of Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock.\nThe Company paid Contract Adjustment Payments to the holders of the 2020 Purchase Contracts at a rate of\n5.375\n% per annum, payable quarterly in arrears on February 15, May 15, August 15 and November 15, which commenced August 15, 2017. The $\n117.1\nmillion initial present value of these Contract Adjustment Payments reduced the Series C Preferred Stock at inception. As each quarterly Contract Adjustment Payment was made, the related liability was reduced and the difference between the cash payments and the present value accreted to interest expense, approximately $\n1.3\nmillion per year over the\nthree-year\nterm. On May 15, 2020, the Company paid the final contract adjustment payment related to the 2020 Purchase Contracts.\nCapped Call Transactions\nIn May 2017, the Company entered into capped call transactions with\nthree\nmajor financial institutions (the “counterparties”) in order to offset the potential economic dilution associated with the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock, to the extent that the conversion value of the convertible preferred stock exceeds its liquidation preference. The Company paid $\n25.1\nmillion, or an average of $\n5.43\nper option, to enter into capped call transactions on\n4.6\nmillion shares of common stock. The $\n25.1\nmillion premium paid was recorded as a reduction of Shareowners' Equity.\nThe capped call transactions had a term of approximately\nthree years\nand were intended to cover the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock. Subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments, the capped call had an initial lower strike price of $\n162.27\n, which corresponded to the minimum\n6.1627\nsettlement rate of the Series C Preferred Stock at inception, and an upper strike price of $\n179.53\n, which was approximately\n30\n% higher than the closing price of the Company\n’\ns common stock on May 11, 2017. In June 2020, the capped call options expired out of the money.\n104\n2018 Capped Call Transactions\nIn March 2018, the Company purchased from a financial in\nstitution “at-the money” ca\npped call options with an approximate term of\nthree years\n, on\n3.2\nmillion shares of its common stock (subject to customary anti-dilution adjustments) for an aggregate premium of $\n57.3\nmillion, or an average of $\n17.96\nper share. The premium paid was recorded as a reduction of Sha\nreowners’\nEquity. The purpose of the capped call options was to hedge the risk of stock price appreciation between the lower and upper strike prices of the capped call options for a future share repurchase.\nIn February 2020, the Company net-share settled\n0.6\nmillion of the\n3.2\nmillion capped call options on its common stock and received\n61,767\nshares using an average reference price of $\n162.26\nper common share.\nOn June 9, 2020, the Company amended the 2018 capped call options to align with and offset the potential economic dilution associated with the common shares issuable upon conversion of the Remarketed Series C Preferred Stock, as further discussed above. Subsequent to the amendment, the capped call options, subject to anti-dilution, had an initial lower strike price of $\n148.34\nand an upper strike price of $\n165.00\n, which was approximately\n30\n% higher than the closing price of the Company\n’\ns common stock on June 9, 2020.\nThe capped call transactions may be settled by net share settlement (the default settlement method) or, at the Company\n’\ns option and subject to certain conditions, cash settlement, physical settlement or modified physical settlement. The number of shares the Company will receive will be determined by the terms of the contracts using a volume-weighted average price calculation for the market value of the Company's common stock, over an averaging period. The market value determined will then be measured against the applicable strike price of the capped call transactions.\nDuring the second quarter of 2021, the Company net-share settled the remaining capped call options on its common stock and received\n344,004\nshares using an average reference price of $\n209.80\nper common share.\nK.\nACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the accumulated balances for each component of Accumulated other comprehensive loss:\nThe reclassifications out of Accumulated other comprehensive loss for the twelve months ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 were as follows:\n105\nL.\nEMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nEMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (“ESOP\n”) — Most U.S. employees may make contributions that do not exceed\n25\n% of their eligible compensation to a tax-deferred 401(k) savings plan, subject to restrictions under tax laws. Employees generally direct the investment of their own contributions into various investment funds. An employer match benefit is provided under the plan equal to one-half of each employee’s tax-deferred contribution up to the first\n7\n% of their compensation. Participants direct the entire employer match benefit such that no participant is required to hold the Company’s common stock in their 401(k) account. The employer match benefit totaled $\n28.0\nmillion, $\n9.2\nmillion and $\n24.6\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the Match was suspended from the second quarter to the end of the year.\nIn addition, approximately\n10,850\nU.S. salaried and non-union hourly employees are eligible to receive a non-contributory benefit under the Core benefit plan. Core benefit allocations range from\n2\n% to\n6\n% of eligible employee compensation based on age. Allocations for benefits earned under the Core plan were $\n31.1\nmillion, $\n5.4\nmillion, and $\n28.4\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2020, the Core allocations were also suspended from the second quarter to the end of the year.  Assets held in participant Core accounts are invested in target date retirement funds which have an age-based allocation of investments.\nPrior to 2021, shares of the Company's common stock that were purchased with the proceeds of borrowings from the Company in 1991 (\"1991 internal loan\") were held by the ESOP.  Shareowners' equity reflects a reduction equal to the cost basis of unallocated shares purchased with the internal borrowings.  Unallocated shares were released from the trust based on current period debt principal and interest payments as a percentage of total future debt principal and interest payments.  Dividends on both allocated and unallocated shares were used for debt service and to credit participant accounts for dividends earned on allocated shares.  Dividends paid on the shares acquired with the 1991 internal loan were used solely to pay internal loan debt service in all periods.  There are no unallocated shares remaining as of January 1, 2022, as all shares in the ESOP trust holding account were released as of the first quarter of 2020.\nThe Company’s net ESOP activity resulted in expense of $\n59.1\nmillion and $\n4.4\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, and income of $\n5.1\nmillion in 2019. Net ESOP activity recognized for 2021 is comprised of the aforementioned Core and 401(k) match defined contribution benefits. Net ESOP activity for 2020 and 2019 is comprised of the cost basis of shares released, the cost of the aforementioned Core and 401(k) match defined contribution benefits, less the fair value of shares released and dividends on unallocated ESOP shares and was affected by the market value of the Company’s common stock on the monthly dates when shares were released. The weighted-average market value of shares released was $\n146.08\nper share in 2020 and $\n138.67\nper share in 2019.\n106\nThe Company made cash contributions totaling $\n35.7\nmillion in 2021, $\n9.2\nmillion in 2020 and $\n2.2\nmillion in 2019, excluding additional contributions of $\n7.2\nmillion and $\n7.0\nmillion in 2020 and 2019, which were used by the ESOP to make additional payments on the 1991 internal loan.  These payments triggered the release of\n226,212\nand\n207,049\nshares of unallocated stock in 2020 and 2019, respectively. Dividends on ESOP shares, which were charged to shareowners’ equity as declared, were $\n1.3\nmillion and $\n6.3\nmillion in 2020 and 2019, respectively, net of the tax benefit which is recorded in earnings. Interest costs incurred by the ESOP on the 1991 internal loan, which have no earnings impact, were $\n0.1\nmillion and $\n0.5\nmillion for 2020 and 2019, respectively. Both allocated and unallocated ESOP shares were treated as outstanding for purposes of computing earnings per share.  As of January 2, 2021, the cumulative number of ESOP shares allocated was\n15,541,357\n, of which participants held\n1,638,044\nshares.\nPENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS\n— The Company sponsors pension plans covering most domestic hourly and certain executive employees, and approximately\n14,800\nforeign employees. Benefits are generally based on salary and years of service, except for U.S. collective bargaining employees whose benefits are based on a stated amount for each year of service.\nThe Company contributes to a number of multi-employer plans for certain collective bargaining U.S. employees. The risks of participating in these multi-employer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following aspects:\na.    Assets contributed to the multi-employer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefit to employees of other participating employers.\nb.    If a participating employer stops contributing to the plan, the unfunded obligations of the plan may be inherited by the remaining participating employers.\nc.    If the Company chooses to stop participating in some of its multi-employer plans, the Company may be required to pay those plans an amount based on the underfunded status of the plan, referred to as a withdrawal liability.\nIn addition, the Company also contributes to a number of multi-employer plans outside of the U.S. The foreign plans are insured, therefore, the Company’s obligation is limited to the payment of insurance premiums.\nThe Company has assessed and determined that none of the multi-employer plans to which it contributes are individually significant to the Company’s Consolidated Financial Statements. The Company does not expect to incur a withdrawal liability or expect to significantly increase its contributions over the remainder of the contract period.\nIn addition to the multi-employer plans, various other defined contribution plans are sponsored worldwide. As of January 1, 2022  and January 2, 2021 the Company had $\n135.8\nmillion and $\n120.2\nmillion, respectively, of liabilities pertaining to an unfunded supplemental defined contribution plan for certain U.S. employees.\nThe expense for defined contribution plans, aside from the earlier discussed ESOP plans, is as follows:\nThe components of net periodic pension expense (benefit) are as follows:\nThe Company provides medical and dental benefits for certain retired employees in the United States, Brazil, and Canada. Approximately\n16,160\nparticipants are covered under these plans.\nNet periodic post-retirement benefit expense was comprised\n107\nof the following elements:\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost other than the service cost component are included in Other, net in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nChanges in plan assets and benefit obligations recognized in Accumulated other comprehensive loss in 2021 are as follows:\n108\nThe changes in the pension and other post-retirement benefit obligations, fair value of plan assets, as well as amounts recognized in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, are shown below.\n109\nActuarial losses and gains reflected in the table above are driven by changes in demographic experience, changes in assumptions, and differences in actual returns on investments compared to estimated returns. For the year ended January 1, 2022, the decrease in the benefit obligation is primarily driven by the improvement in the single equivalent discount rate used to measure these obligations. The actual return on plan assets during the year also varied in comparison to what was assumed, which also impacted the funded position. These impacts were partially offset by an updated mortality improvement scale which increased the projected obligations.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n2.943\nbillion at January 1, 2022 and $\n3.022\nbillion at January 2, 2021.\nInformation regarding pension plans in which accumulated benefit obligations exceed plan assets follows:\nInformation regarding pension plans in which projected benefit obligations (inclusive of anticipated future compensation increases) exceed plan assets as follows:\nThe major assumptions used in valuing pension and post-retirement plan obligations and net costs were as follows:\nThe expected rate of return on plan assets is determined considering the returns projected for the various asset classes and the relative weighting for each asset cla\nss.\nThe Company will use a\n4.07\n% weighted-average expected rate of return assumption to determine the 2022 net periodic benefit cost.\nPENSION PLAN ASSETS\n— Plan assets are\ninvested in\nequity securities, government and corporate bonds and other fixed income securities, money market instruments and insurance contracts.\nThe Company’s worldwide asset allocations at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 by asset category and the level of the valuation inputs within the fair value hierarchy established by ASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n, are as follows:\n110\nU.S. and foreign equity securities primarily consist of companies with large market capitalizations and to a lesser extent mid and small capitalization securities. Government securities primarily consist of U.S. Treasury securities and foreign government securities with de minimus default risk. Corporate fixed income securities include publicly traded U.S. and foreign investment grade and to a small extent high yield securities. Assets held in insurance contracts are invested in the general asset pools of the various insurers, mainly debt and equity securities with guaranteed returns. Other investments include diversified private equity holdings. The level 2 investments are primarily comprised of institutional mutual funds that are not publicly traded; the investments held in these mutual funds are generally level 1 publicly traded securities.\nThe Company's investment strategy for pension assets focuses on a liability-matching approach with gradual de-risking taking place over a period of many years.  The Company utilizes the current funded status to transition the portfolio toward investments that better match the duration and cash flow attributes of the underlying liabilities. Assets approximating\n50\n% of the Company's current pension liabilities have been invested in fixed income securities, using a liability / asset matching duration strategy, with the primary goal of mitigating exposure to interest rate movements and preserving the overall funded status of the underlying plans. Plan assets are broadly diversified and are invested to ensure adequate liquidity for immediate and medium term benefit payments. The Company’s target asset allocations include approximately\n20\n%-\n40\n% in equity securities, approximately\n50\n%-\n70\n% in fixed income securities and approximately\n10\n% in other securities. The funded status percentage (total plan assets divided by total projected benefit obligation) of all global pension plans was\n87\n% in 2021,\n80\n% in 2020 and\n79\n% in 2019. The increase in 2021 compared to 2020 and 2019 primarily relates to the pension plan assumed in the MTD acquisition.\nCONTRIBUTIONS\n—\nThe Company’s funding policy for its defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts determined annually on an actuarial basis to provide for current and future benefits in accordance with federal law and other regulations. The Company expects to contribute approxim\nately $\n41\nmillion to\nits pension and other post-retirement benefit plans in 2022.\n111\nEXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS\n—\nBenefit payments, inclusive of amounts attributable to estimated future employee service, are expected to be paid as follows over the next 10 years:\nThese benefit payments will be funded through a combination of existing plan assets, the returns on those assets, and amounts to be contributed in the future by the Company.\nHEALTH CARE COST TRENDS\n—\nThe weighted-average annual assumed rate of increase in the per-capita cost of covered benefits (i.e., health care cost trend rate) is assumed to be\n6.3\n% for 2022, reducing gradually to\n4.6\n% by 2031 and remaining at that level thereafter.\nM.\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nASC 820,\nFair Value Measurement\n, defines, establishes a consistent framework for measuring, and expands disclosure requirements about fair value. ASC 820 requires the Company to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Observable inputs reflect market data obtained from independent sources, while unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s market assumptions. These two types of inputs create the following fair value hierarchy:\nLevel 1 — Quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets.\nLevel 2 — Quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets; quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active; and model-derived valuations whose inputs and significant value drivers are observable.\nLevel 3 — Instruments that are valued using unobservable inputs.\nThe Company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, stock prices and commodity prices. The Company holds various financial instruments to manage these risks. These financial instruments are carried at fair value and are included within the scope of ASC 820. The Company determines the fair value of these financial instruments through the use of matrix or model pricing, which utilizes observable inputs such as market interest and currency rates. When determining fair value for which Level 1 evidence does not exist, the Company considers various factors including the following: exchange or market price quotations of similar instruments, time value and volatility factors, the Company’s own credit rating and the credit rating of the counterparty.\nThe following table presents the Company’s financial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis for each of the hierarchy levels:\n112\nThe following table provides information about the Company's financial assets and liabilities not carried at fair value:\nThe money market fund and other investments related to the West Coast Loading Corporation (\"WCLC\") trust are considered Level 1 instruments within the fair value hierarchy. The equity security is considered a Level 1 instrument and is recorded at its quoted market price.\nThe\ndeferred compensation plan investments are considered Level 1 instrument and are recorded at their quoted market price. The long-term debt instruments are considered Level 2 instruments and are measured using a discounted cash flow analysis based on the Company’s marginal borrowing rates. The differences between the carrying values and fair values of long-term debt are attributable to the stated interest rates differing from the Company's marginal borrowing rates. The fair values of the Company's variable rate short-term borrowings approximate their carrying values at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021. The fair values of derivative financial instruments in the table above are based on current settlement values.\nAs part of the Craftsman® brand acquisition in March 2017, the Company recorded a contingent consideration liability representing the Company's obligation to make future payments to Transform Holdco, LLC, which operates Sears and Kmart retail locations, of between\n2.5\n% and\n3.5\n% on sales of Craftsman products in new Stanley Black & Decker channels through March 2032. During the year ended January 1, 2022, the Company paid approximately $\n29.3\nmillion for royalties owned. The Company will continue making future payments quarterly through the second quarter of 2032. The estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis taking into consideration future sales projections, forecasted payments to Transform Holdco, LLC, based on contractual royalty rates, and the related tax impacts.\nThe estimated fair value of the contingent consideration liability was $\n288.6\nmillion and $\n187.0\nmillion as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively. The liability increased $\n101\nmillion in 2021 compared to 2020 due to additional forecasted Craftsman sales resulting from the acquisition of MTD. Adjustments to the contingent consideration liability, with the exception of cash payments, are recorded in SG&A in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. A 100-basis point reduction in the discount rate would result in an increase to the liability of approximately $\n10.5\nmillion as of January 1, 2022.\nA single estimate of fair value results from a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and relies heavily on estimates and assumptions.  The Company's judgments used to determine the estimated contingent consideration liability discussed above, including estimated future sales projections, can materially impact the Company's results of operations.\nThe Company had no significant non-recurring fair value measurements, nor any other financial assets or liabilities measured using Level 3 inputs, during 2021 or 2020.\nRefer to\nNote I, Financial Instruments\n, for more details regarding derivative financial instruments,\nNote S, Contingencies,\nfor more details regarding the other investments related to the WCLC trust, and\nNote H, Long-Term Debt and Financing Arrangements\n, for more information regarding the carrying values of the Company's long-term debt.\nN.\nOTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES\nOther, net is primarily comprised of intangible asset amortization expense (see\nNote F, Goodwill and Intangible Assets\n), currency-related gains or losses, environmental remediation expense, acquisition-related transaction and consulting costs, and certain pension gains or losses. Acquisition-related transaction and consulting costs of $\n24.1\nmillion, $\n28.7\nmillion, and $\n27.6\nmillion were included in Other, net for the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019, respectively. In 2020, Other, net also included a $\n14.1\nmillion special termination benefit charge associated with the voluntary retirement program, a $\n19.6\nmillion loss relating to the unamortized loss on cash flow swap terminations, and a $\n55.3\nmillion release of a contingent consideration liability relating to the CAM acquisition. Refer to\nNote E, Acquisitions and Investments\n, for further discussion of the CAM contingent consideration. The year-over-year decrease in 2021 was primarily due to appreciation of Stanley Ventures' investments. The year-over-year increase in 2020 driven by higher intangible asset amortization and negative impacts from foreign currency.\nDuring 2020, the Company recognized pre-tax charges of approximately $\n185.0\nmillion related to the comprehensive cost reduction and efficiency program in response to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The charges were primarily related to costs associated with a voluntary retirement program as well as restructuring costs related to headcount actions.\n113\nResearch and development costs, which are classified in SG&A, were $\n276.3\nmillion, $\n200.0\nmillion and $\n240.8\nmillion for fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nO.\nRESTRUCTURING CHARGES\nA summary of the restructuring reserve activity from January 2, 2021 to January 1, 2022 is as follows:\nDuring 2021, the Company recognized net restructuring charges of $\n14.5\nmillion, primarily related to facility closures and asset impairments.\nThe majority of the $\n31.9\nmillion of reserves remaining as of January 1, 2022 is expected to be utilized within the next 12 months.\nSegments:\nThe $\n15\nmillion of net restructuring charges for the year ended January 1, 2022 includes: $\n8\nmillion pertaining to the Tools & Storage segment; $\n2\nmillion pertaining to the Industrial segment; and $\n5\nmillion pertaining to Corporate.\nP.\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS\nThe Company’s operations are classified into\ntwo\nreportable business segments: Tools & Storage and Industrial.

Net sales and long-lived assets are attributed to the geographic regions based on the geographic locations of the end customer and the Company subsidiary, respectively.\n114\nBUSINESS SEGMENTS\nCorporate Overhead & Other includes the results of the commercial electronic security business in\nfive\ncountries in Europe and emerging markets through its disposition in the fourth quarter of 2020 and the Mechanical Access Solutions business, a non-reportable business operating segment, as well as the corporate overhead element of SG&A, which is not allocated to the business segments.\nCorporate Overhead & Other assets primarily consist of cash, equity method investment, deferred taxes, property, plant and equipment and right-of-use lease assets, and include assets directly attributable to the MAS business. The decrease in Corporate Overhead & Other assets at January 1, 2022 compared to January 2, 2021 is due to the decrease in the Company's cash position.\n115\nBased on the nature of the Company's cash pooling arrangements, at times corporate-related cash accounts will be in a net liability position.\nLowe's accounted for approximately\n15\n%,\n17\n% and\n17\n% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, while The Home Depot accounted for approximately\n15\n%,\n14\n% and\n12\n% of the Company's consolidated net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAs described in\nNote A, Significant Accounting Policies\n, the Company recognizes revenue at a point in time from the sale of tangible products or over time depending on when the performance obligation is satisfied. For the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019, the majority of the Company’s revenue was recognized at the time of sale.\nThe following table provides the percent of total segment revenue recognized over time for the Industrial segment for the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019:\nThe following table is a further disaggregation of the Industrial segment revenue for the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021 and December 28, 2019:\nGEOGRAPHIC AREAS\nQ.\nINCOME TAXES\n116\nSignificant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets and liabilities from continuing operations at the end of each fiscal year were as follows:\nThe increase in intangible deferred tax assets relates to the intra-entity asset transfer of certain intangible assets between two of the Company's foreign subsidiaries. The recognized deferred tax benefit represents the difference between the basis of the intellectual property for financial statement purposes and the basis of the intellectual property for tax purposes.\nA valuation allowance is recorded on certain deferred tax assets if it has been determined it is more likely than not that all or a portion of these assets will not be realized. The Company recorded a valuation allowance of $\n1,067.2\nmillion and $\n1,001.9\nmillion on deferred tax assets existing as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively. The valuation allowances in 2021 and 2020 are primarily attributable to foreign and state net operating loss carryforwards, intangible assets, foreign capital loss carryforwards, and state tax credits.\nBeginning in 2022, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (\"Act\") eliminates the option to deduct research and development expenditures and requires taxpayers to amortize domestic expenditures over five years and foreign expenditures over fifteen years. While it is possible that Congress may modify or repeal this provision, the Company has no assurance that these provisions will be modified or repealed. Therefore, based on current assumptions, this would decrease the Company's cash from operations beginning in 2022 and continue over the five year amortization period.\nOn March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021 (the “ARPA”) was enacted. The ARPA, among other things, includes provisions to expand the IRC Section 162(m) disallowance for deduction of certain compensation paid by publicly held corporations, provide a 100% COBRA subsidy, temporarily increase the income exclusion for dependent care assistance, and to extend and modify the employee retention credit and the Families First Coronavirus Response Act paid leave credit. On March 27, 2020, the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”) was enacted. The CARES Act, among other things, includes provisions relating to refundable payroll tax credits, deferment of employer social security payments, net operating loss carryback periods, alternative minimum tax credit refunds, modifications to the net interest deduction limitations and technical corrections to tax depreciation methods for qualified improvement property. The Company completed its evaluation of the ARPA and CARES Act, and concluded that they did not have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company has approximately $\n4.7\nbillion of unremitted foreign earnings and profits. Of the total amount, the Company has provided for deferred taxes of $\n48.2\nmillion on approximately $\n1.5\nbillion, which is not indefinitely reinvested primarily due to the changes brought about by the Act. The Company otherwise continues to consider the remaining undistributed earnings of its foreign subsidiaries to be permanently reinvested based on its current plans for use outside of the\n117\nU.S. and accordingly no taxes have been provided on such earnings. The cash held by the Company’s non-U.S. subsidiaries for indefinite reinvestment is generally used to finance foreign operations and investments, including acquisitions. The income taxes applicable to such earnings are not readily determinable or practicable to calculate.\nNet operating loss carryforwards of $\n3.0\nbillion as of January 1, 2022 are available to reduce future tax obligations of certain U.S. and foreign companies. The net operating loss carryforwards have various expiration dates beginning in 2022 with certain jurisdictions having indefinite carryforward periods. The foreign capital loss carryforwards of $\n42.4\nmillion as of January 1, 2022 have indefinite carryforward periods.\nU.S. foreign tax credit carryforward balance as of January 1, 2022 totaled $\n20.6\nmillion with various expiration dates beginning in 2028. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforward of  $\n12.9\nmillion is included in unrecognized tax benefits and subject to an annual limitation, which constitutes a change of ownership as defined under the Internal Revenue Code Section 382. State tax credit carryforward balance as of January 1, 2022 totaled $\n18.7\nmillion. The carryforward balance is made up of various credit types spanning multiple state taxing jurisdictions and various expiration dates beginning in 2022.\nThe components of earnings before income taxes from continuing operations consisted of the following:\nIncome tax expense (benefit) consisted of the following:\nNet income taxes paid for continuing operations during 2021, 2020 and 2019 were $\n441.8\nmillion, $\n241.6\nmillion and $\n234.6\nmillion, respectively. The 2021, 2020 and 2019 amounts include refunds of $\n50.1\nmillion, $\n43.8\nmillion and $\n65.3\nmillion, respectively, primarily related to prior year overpayments and settlement of tax audits.\n118\nThe reconciliation of the U.S. federal statutory income tax provision to Income taxes in the Consolidated Statements of Operations from continuing operations is as follows:\nThe Company conducts business globally and, as a result, files income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various state and foreign jurisdictions. In the normal course, the Company is subject to examinations by taxing authorities throughout the world. The Internal Revenue Service is currently examining the Company's consolidated U.S. income tax returns for the 2015 through 2018 tax years. With few exceptions, as of January 1, 2022, the Company is no longer subject to U.S. federal, state, local, or foreign examinations by tax authorities for years before 2012.\nThe Company’s liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits relate to U.S. and various foreign jurisdictions.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to the unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations:\nThe gross unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations at January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021 include $\n478.4\nmillion and $\n418.6\nmillion, respectively, of tax benefits that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate. The liability for potential penalties and interest related to unrecognized tax benefits from continuing operations increased by $\n9.6\nmillion in 2021 and decreased by $\n3.4\nmillion in 2020 and $\n4.3\nmillion in 2019. The liability for potential penalties and interest totaled $\n60.0\nmillion as of January 1, 2022, $\n49.2\nmillion as of January 2, 2021, and $\n45.8\nmillion as of December 28, 2019. The Company classifies all tax-related interest and penalties as income tax expense.\nThe Company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and the impact on income tax expense, which may require periodic adjustments, and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes. It is reasonably possible that the amount of the unrecognized benefit with respect to certain of the Company's unrecognized tax positions will significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. However, based on the uncertainties associated with finalizing audits with the relevant tax authorities including formal legal proceedings, it is not possible to reasonably estimate the impact of any such change.\nR.\nCOMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES\nCOMMITMENTS —\nThe Company has numerous assets, predominantly real estate, vehicles and equipment, under various lease arrangements. At inception of arrangements with vendors, the Company determines whether the contract is or contains a lease based on each party’s rights and obligations under the arrangement. If the lease arrangement also contains non-lease components, the lease and non-lease elements are separately accounted for in accordance with the appropriate accounting\n119\nguidance for each item. From time to time, lease arrangements allow for, and the Company executes, the purchase of the underlying leased asset. Lease arrangements may also contain renewal options or early termination options. As part of its lease liability and right-of-use asset calculation, consideration is given to the likelihood of exercising any extension or termination options. Leases with expected durations of less than 12 months from inception (i.e. short-term leases) are excluded from the Company’s calculation of lease liabilities and right-of-use assets, as permitted by ASC 842,\nLeases\n.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's right-of-use-assets and lease liabilities:\nRight-of-use assets are included within\nOther assets\nin the Consolidated Balance Sheets, while lease liabilities are included within\nAccrued expenses\nand\nOther liabilities\n, as appropriate. The Company determines its incremental borrowing rate based on interest rates from its debt issuances, taking into consideration adjustments for collateral, lease terms and foreign currency.\nAs a result of acquiring right-of-use assets from new leases entered into during the years ended January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company's lease liabilities increased approximately $\n86.2\nmillion and $\n91.0\nmillion, respectively.  The Company acquired $\n38.9\nmillion specifically from the acquisition of MTD.  As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, $\n77.7\nmillion and $\n85.1\nmillion of right-of-use assets, respectively, were reclassed to assets held-for-sale. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, $\n75.1\nmillion and $\n85.0\nmillion of lease liabilities, respectively, were reclassed to liabilities held-for-sale.\nThe Company is a party to leases for\none\nof its major distribution centers and\ntwo\nof its office buildings in which the periodic rental payments vary based on interest rates (i.e. LIBOR). The leases qualify as operating leases for accounting purposes.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's total lease cost for the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019:\nThe amounts above are inclusive of lease cost for discontinued operations amounting to $\n22.9\nmillion in 2021, $\n25.4\nmillion in 2020, and $\n36.0\nmillion in 2019.\nDuring 2021, 2020, and 2019, the Company paid approximately $\n129.4\nmillion, $\n117.9\nmillion, and $\n128.2\nmillion respectively, relating to leases included in the measurement of its lease liability and right-of-use asset. Lease payments relating to discontinued operations during 2021, 2020, and 2019 were $\n29.0\nmillion, $\n31.9\nmillion, and $\n26.2\nmillion respectively.\nThe following is a summary of the Company's future lease obligations on an undiscounted basis at January 1, 2022:\nThe amounts above include undiscounted future lease obligations for discontinued operations totaling $\n80.7\nmillion; $\n25.4\nmillion in 2022, $\n19.1\nmillion in 2023, $\n14.0\nmillion in 2024, $\n9.5\nmillion in 2025, $\n6.1\nmillion in 2026, and $\n6.6\nmillion thereafter.\nThe following is a summary of the Company’s future marketing commitments at January 1, 2022:\n120\nThe amounts above include future marketing commitments for discontinued operations totaling $\n1.0\nmillion; $\n0.9\nmillion in 2022 and $\n0.1\nmillion in 2023.\nGUARANTEES —\nThe Company's financial guarantees at January 1, 2022 are as follows:\nThe Company has guaranteed a portion of the residual values of certain leased assets including the previously discussed leases for\none\nof its major distribution centers and\ntwo\nof its office buildings. The lease guarantees are for an amount up to $\n89.6\nmillion while the fair value of the underlying assets is estimated at $\n116.2\nmillion. The related assets would be available to satisfy the guarantee obligations and therefore it is unlikely the Company will incur any future loss associated with these guarantees.\nThe Company has issued $\n165.7\nmillion in standby letters of credit that guarantee future payments which may be required under certain insurance programs and in relation to certain environmental remediation activities described more fully in\nNote S, Contingencies\n.\nThe Company provides various limited and full recourse guarantees to financial institutions that provide financing to U.S. and Canadian Mac Tool distributors and franchisees for their initial purchase of the inventory and trucks necessary to function as a distributor and franchisee. In addition, the Company provides limited and full recourse guarantees to financial institutions that extend credit to certain end retail customers of its U.S. Mac Tool distributors and franchisees. The gross amount guaranteed in these arrangements is $\n69.2\nmillion and the $\n8.5\nmillion carrying value of the guarantees issued is recorded in Other liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe Company provides warranties on certain products across its businesses. The types of product warranties offered generally range from\none year\nto limited lifetime. There are also certain products with no warranty. Further, the Company sometimes incurs discretionary costs to service its products in connection with product performance issues. Historical warranty and service claim experience forms the basis for warranty obligations recognized. Adjustments are recorded to the warranty liability as new information becomes available.\nThe changes in the carrying amount of product warranties for the years ended January 1, 2022, January 2, 2021, and December 28, 2019:\nProduct warranties totaling $\n4.6\nmillion, and $\n5.0\nmillion were reclassed to held for sale as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, respectively.\nS.\nCONTINGENCIES\nThe Company is involved in various legal proceedings relating to environmental issues, employment, product liability, workers’ compensation claims and other matters. The Company periodically reviews the status of these proceedings with both inside and outside counsel, as well as an actuary for risk insurance. Management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters will not have a material adverse effect on operations or financial condition taken as a whole.\n121\nIn the normal course of business, the Company is a party to administrative proceedings and litigation, before federal and state regulatory agencies, relating to environmental remediation with respect to claims involving the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment, generally at current and former manufacturing facilities. In addition, some of these claims assert that the Company is responsible for damages and liability, for remedial investigation and clean-up costs, with respect to sites that have never been owned or operated by the Company, but the Company has been identified as a potentially responsible party (\"PRP\").\nIn connection with the 2010 merger with Black & Decker, the Company assumed certain commitments and contingent liabilities. Black & Decker is a party to litigation and administrative proceedings with respect to claims involving the discharge of hazardous substances into the environment at current and former manufacturing facilities and has also been named as a PRP in certain administrative proceedings.\nThe Company, along with many other companies, has been named as a PRP in numerous administrative proceedings for the remediation of various waste sites, including\n28\nactive Superfund sites. Current laws potentially impose joint and several liabilities upon each PRP. In assessing its potential liability at these sites, the Company has considered the following: whether responsibility is being disputed, the terms of existing agreements, experience at similar sites, and the Company’s volumetric contribution at these sites.\nThe Company’s policy is to accrue environmental investigatory and remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated. If no amount in the range of probable loss is considered most likely, the minimum loss in the range is accrued. The amount of liability recorded is based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and includes such factors as existing technology, presently enacted laws and regulations, and prior experience in remediation of contaminated sites. The liabilities recorded do not take into account any claims for recoveries from insurance or third parties. As assessments and remediation progress at individual sites, the amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. As of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021, the Company had reserves of $\n159.1\nmillion and $\n174.2\nmillion, respectively, for remediation activities associated with Company-owned properties, as well as for Superfund sites, for losses that are probable and estimable. Of the 2021 amount, $\n46.1\nmillion is classified as current and $\n113.0\nmillion as long-term which is expected to be paid over the estimated remediation period. As of January 1, 2022, the range of environmental remediation costs that is reasonably possible is $\n93.7\nmillion to $\n229.3\nmillion which is subject to change in the near term. The Company may be liable for environmental remediation of sites it no longer owns. Liabilities have been recorded on those sites in accordance with the Company's policy.\nAs of January 1, 2022, the Company has recorded $\n16.1\nmillion in other assets related to funding received by the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and placed in a trust in accordance with the final settlement with the EPA, embodied in a Consent Decree approved by the United States District Court for the Central District of California on July 3, 2013. Per the Consent Decree, Emhart Industries, Inc. (a dissolved and liquidated former indirectly wholly-owned subsidiary of The Black & Decker Corporation) (“Emhart”) has agreed to be responsible for an interim remedy at a site located in Rialto, California and formerly operated by West Coast Loading Corporation (“WCLC”), a defunct company for which Emhart was alleged to be liable as a successor. The remedy will be funded by (i) the amounts received from the EPA as gathered from multiple parties, and, to the extent necessary, (ii) Emhart's affiliate. The interim remedy requires the construction of a water treatment facility and the filtering of ground water at or around the site for a period of approximately\n30\nyears or more. As of January 1, 2022, the Company's net cash obligation associated with remediation activities, including WCLC assets, is $\n143.0\nmillion.\nThe EPA also asserted claims in federal court in Rhode Island against Black & Decker and Emhart related to environmental contamination found at the Centredale Manor Restoration Project Superfund Site (\"Centredale\"), located in North Providence, Rhode Island. The EPA discovered a variety of contaminants at the site, including but not limited to, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, and pesticides. The EPA alleged that Black & Decker and Emhart are liable for site clean-up costs under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\") as successors to the liability of Metro-Atlantic, Inc., a former operator at the site, and demanded reimbursement of the EPA’s costs related to this site. Black & Decker and Emhart then vigorously litigated the issue of their liability for environmental conditions at the Centredale site, including completing trial on Phase 1 of the proceedings in late July 2015 and completing trial on Phase 2 of the proceedings in April 2017. On July 9, 2018, a Consent Decree was lodged with the United States District Court documenting the terms of a settlement between the Company and the United States for reimbursement of EPA's past costs and remediation of environmental contamination found at the Centredale site. The terms of the Consent Decree were subject to public comment and Court approval. After a full hearing on March 19, 2019, the Court approved and entered the Consent Decree on April 8, 2019. The settlement resolves outstanding issues relating to Phase 1 and 2 of the litigation with the United States. The Company is complying with the terms of the settlement. The District Court's entry of the Consent Decree was appealed by several PRPs at the site to the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit. The District Court's actions were affirmed by the First Circuit\n122\non February 17, 2021. Phase 3 of the litigation, is addressing the potential allocation of liability to other PRPs who may have contributed to contamination of the Centredale site with dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls and other contaminants of concern. As of January 1, 2022, the Company has a remaining reserve of $\n57.2\nmillion for this site.\nThe Company and approximately\n47\nother companies comprise the Lower Passaic Cooperating Parties Group (the “CPG”). The CPG members and other companies are parties to a May 2007 Administrative Settlement Agreement and Order on Consent (“AOC”) with the EPA to perform a remedial investigation/feasibility study (“RI/FS”) of the lower\nseventeen\nmiles of the Lower Passaic River in New Jersey (the “River”). The Company’s potential liability stems from former operations in Newark, New Jersey. As an interim step related to the 2007 AOC, on June 18, 2012,\nthe CPG members voluntarily entered into an AOC with the EPA for remediation actions focused solely at mile 10.9 of the River. The Company’s estimated costs related to the RI/FS and focused remediation action at mile 10.9, based on an interim allocation, are included in its environmental reserves. On April 11, 2014, the EPA issued a Focused Feasibility Study (“FFS”) and proposed plan which addressed various early action remediation alternatives for the lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River. The EPA received public comment on the FFS and proposed plan (including comments from the CPG and other entities asserting that the FFS and proposed plan do not comply with CERCLA) which public comment period ended on August 20, 2014. The CPG submitted to the EPA a draft RI report in February 2015 and draft FS report in April 2015 for the entire lower\nseventeen\nmiles of the River. On March 4, 2016, the EPA issued a Record of Decision (\"ROD\") selecting the remedy for the lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River. The cleanup plan adopted by the EPA is now considered a final action for the lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River and will include the removal of\n3.5\nmillion cubic yards of sediment, placement of a cap over the entire lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River, and, according to the EPA, will cost approximately $\n1.4\nbillion and take\n6\nyears to implement after the remedial design is completed. The Company and\n105\nother parties received a letter dated March 31, 2016 from the EPA notifying such parties of potential liability for the costs of the cleanup of the lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River and a letter dated March 30, 2017 stating that the EPA had offered\n20\nof the parties (not including the Company) an early cash out settlement. In a letter dated May 17, 2017, the EPA stated that these\n20\nparties did not discharge any of the\neight\nhazardous substances identified as the contaminants of concern in the lower\n8.3\nmile ROD. In the March 30, 2017 letter, the EPA stated that other parties who did not discharge dioxins, furans or polychlorinated biphenyls (which are considered the contaminants of concern posing the greatest risk to human health or the environment) may also be eligible for cash out settlement, but expects those parties' allocation to be determined through a complex settlement analysis using a third-party allocator. The EPA subsequently clarified this statement to say that such parties would be eligible to be \"funding parties\" for the lower\n8.3\nmile remedial action with each party's share of the costs determined by the EPA based on the allocation process and the remaining parties would be \"work parties\" for the remedial action. The Company asserts that it did not discharge dioxins, furans or polychlorinated biphenyls and should be eligible to be a \"funding party\" for the lower 8.3 mile remedial action. The Company participated in the allocation process. The allocator selected by the EPA issued a confidential allocation report on December 28, 2020, which was reviewed by the EPA. As a result of the allocation process, on February 11, 2022, the EPA and certain parties (including the Company) reached an agreement in principle, subject to the negotiation and court entry of a consent decree, concerning a cash-out settlement for remediation of the entire 17-mile Lower Passaic River. On September 30, 2016, Occidental Chemical Corporation (\"OCC\") entered into an agreement with the EPA to perform the remedial design for the cleanup plan for the lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River. The remedial design is expected to be substantially completed in the fourth quarter of 2022. On June 30, 2018, OCC filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey against over\n100\ncompanies, including the Company, seeking CERCLA cost recovery or contribution for past costs relating to various investigations and cleanups OCC has conducted or is conducting in connection with the River. According to the complaint, OCC has incurred or is incurring costs which include the estimated cost ($\n165\nmillion) to complete the remedial design for the cleanup plan for the lower\n8.3\nmiles of the River. OCC also seeks a declaratory judgment to hold the defendants liable for their proper shares of future response costs for OCC's ongoing activities in connection with the River. The Company and other defendants have answered the complaint and currently are engaged in discovery with OCC. On February 24, 2021, the Company and other defendants filed a third party complaint against the Passaic Valley Sewerage Commissioners and forty-two municipalities to require those entities to pay their equitable share of response costs. On October 10, 2018, the EPA issued a letter directing the CPG to prepare a streamlined feasibility study for the upper\n9\nmiles of the River based on an iterative approach using adaptive management strategies. The CPG submitted a revi\nsed draft Interim\nRemedy Feasibility Study to the EPA on December 4, 2020, which identifies various targeted dredge and cap alternatives with costs that range from $\n420\nmillion to $\n468\nmillion (net present value). The EPA approved the Interim Remedy Feasibility Study on December 11, 2020. The EPA issued the Interim Remedy Proposed Plan on April 14, 2021, selecting an alternative that the EPA estimates will cost $\n441\nmillion (net present value). The CPG continues to conduct work to complete the RI/FS for the entire 17-mile River. The EPA issued the Interim Remedy ROD on September 28, 2021. At this time, the Company cannot reasonably estimate its liability related to the litigation and remediation efforts, excluding the RI/FS and remediation actions at mile 10.9, as the OCC litigation is pending, the EPA settlement process is ongoing and the parties that will participate in funding the remediation and their respective allocations are not yet known.\nPer the terms of a Final Order and Judgment approved by the United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida on January 22, 1991, Emhart is responsible for a percentage of remedial costs arising out of the Kerr McGee Chemical Corporation Superfund Site located in Jacksonville, Florida. On March 15, 2017, the Company received formal notification from the EPA that the EPA had issued a ROD selecting the preferred alternative identified in the Proposed Cleanup Plan. As of January 1, 2022, the Company has reserved $\n22.2\nmillion for this site.\n123\nThe environmental liability for certain sites that have cash payments beyond the current year that are fixed or reliably determinable have been discounted using a rate of\n0.1\n% to\n2.0\n%, depending on the expected timing of disbursements. The discounted and undiscounted amount of the liability relative to these sites is $\n40.9\nmillion and $\n44.7\nmillion, respectively. The payments relative to these sites are expected to be $\n2.7\nmillion in 2022, $\n3.1\nmillion in 2023, $\n3.1\nmillion in 2024, $\n2.8\nmillion in 2025, $\n2.9\nmillion in 2026, and $\n30.1\nmillion thereafter.\nThe amount recorded for identified contingent liabilities is based on\nestimates. Amounts recorded are reviewed periodically and adjusted to reflect additional technical and legal information that becomes available. Actual costs to be incurred in future periods may vary from the estimates, given the inherent uncertainties in evaluating certain exposures. Subject to the imprecision in estimating future contingent liability costs, the Company does not expect that any sum it may have to pay in connection with these matters in excess of the amounts recorded will have a materially adverse effect on its financial position, results of operations or liquidity.\nT.\nDIVESTITURES\nPENDING DIVESTITURE\nCommercial Electronic Security and Healthcare businesses\nIn December 2021, the Company announced that it had reached a definitive agreement for the sale of most of its Security assets to Securitas AB (\"Purchaser\") for approximately $\n3.2\nbillion in cash. The proposed transaction includes the Company's Convergent Security Solutions (\"CSS\") business comprising of commercial electronic security and healthcare businesses. The transaction does not include the Company's automatic doors business. The sale is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary closing conditions, and is expected to close in the first half of 2022.\nAs part of the purchase and sale agreement, the Company will perform transition services relating to certain administrative functions for Purchaser primarily for a period of one year or less, pending Purchaser's integration of these functions into their pre-existing business processes. A portion of the $\n3.2\nbillion received at closing reimburses the Company for transition service costs expected to be incurred.\nIn December 2021, upon announcing it reached a definitive agreement for the sale of most of its Security assets, the assets and liabilities related to CSS were classified as held for sale on the Company's Consolidated Balance Sheets as of January 1, 2022 and January 2, 2021. In addition, the sale of CSS represents a strategic shift and has a major effect on the Company's operations and financial results. As such, the operating results of the CSS are reported as discontinued operations, in accordance with ASC 205.
