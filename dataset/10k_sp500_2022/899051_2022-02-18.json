    "text": "The Allstate Corporation was incorporated under the laws of the State of Delaware on November 5, 1992, to serve as the holding company for Allstate Insurance Company. Its business is conducted principally through Allstate Insurance Company and other subsidiaries (collectively, including The Allstate Corporation, “Allstate”).\nAllstate protects people from life’s uncertainties with a wide array of protection for autos, homes and personal property. Allstate is primarily engaged in the property and casualty insurance business in the United States and Canada. Additionally, Allstate provides customers other protection solutions such as accident and health insurance, protection plans that cover consumer electronics, mobile phones and appliances and personal identity protection.\nThe Allstate Corporation is one of the largest publicly held personal lines insurers in the United States. Allstate’s personal property-liability strategy is to increase market share by offering consumers a broad suite of protection solutions and a competitive value proposition across distribution channels. The Allstate brand is widely known through the “You’re In Good Hands With Allstate\n®\n” slogan. Allstate is the second largest personal property and casualty insurer in the United States on the basis of 2020 statutory direct premiums written according to A.M. Best, including the acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. (“National General”).\nAllstate also has strong market positions in other protection solutions. Allstate Health and Benefits provides accident, health and life insurance through employers, independent agents and direct-to-consumer, and is one of the top voluntary benefits carriers in the market. Allstate Protection Plans provides protection on a wide variety of consumer goods such as cell phones, tablets, computers, furniture and appliances, and has a leading position in distribution through major retailers. Allstate Identity Protection has a leading position in identity protection through worksite distribution. In total, Allstate had 190.9 million policies in force (“PIF”) as of December 31, 2021.\nIn this Annual Report on Form 10-K, we occasionally refer to statutory financial information. All domestic United States insurance companies are required to prepare statutory-basis financial statements. As a result, industry data is available that enables comparisons between insurance companies, including competitors that are not required to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We frequently use industry publications containing statutory financial information to assess our competitive position.\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nOn January 4, 2021, Allstate completed the acquisition of National General, expanding its independent agent channel business.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2021, Allstate completed the sales of Allstate Life Insurance Company (“ALIC”), Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York (“ALNY”) and certain affiliates.\nFor additional information, see Part II, Item 8 - Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements of this report.\nThe Allstate Corporation      1\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nStrategy, Transformative Growth, Our Shared Purpose and Segment Information\nOur strategy has two components: increase personal property-liability market share (see Allstate Protection segment) and expand protection offerings by leveraging the Allstate brand, customer base and capabilities.\nTransformative Growth\nis about creating a business model, capabilities and culture that continually transform to better serve customers. This is done by providing affordable, simple and connected protection through multiple distribution partners. The ultimate objective is to create continuous transformative growth in all businesses.\nWe are expanding protection businesses utilizing enterprise capabilities and resources such as distribution, analytics, claims, investment expertise, talent and capital. Using innovative growth platforms (such as telematics and identity protection) and broad distribution including: Allstate exclusive agents, independent agents, contact centers, online, retailers, workplace benefits brokers, auto dealers, original equipment manufacturers and telecom providers further enhance our customer value proposition.\n2      www.allstate.com\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\n(1)\nAllstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments comprise Property-Liability.\nThe Allstate Corporation      3\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nAllstate Protection Segment\nOur Allstate Protection segment accounted for 91.9% of Allstate’s 2021 consolidated insurance premiums and contract charges and 20.0% of Allstate’s December 31, 2021 PIF. Private passenger auto, homeowners, other personal lines and commercial insurance products offered through both exclusive and independent agents and directly through contact centers and online are included in this segment. Our strategy is to offer products in an open access, digital first model that allows customers to interact with us when, where and how they want with affordable, simple and connected protection products.\nStrategy\nAllstate Protection’s strategy is to increase personal lines market share through Transformative Growth focusing on:\n•\nExpanding customer access to Allstate and National General products and services through the methods of interaction customers want\n•\nImproving customer value by making it easier to do business with us and improved price competitiveness driven by reducing our cost structure\n•\nIncreasing sophistication and investment in customer acquisition\n•\nDeploying new technology to support customer experience and product management ecosystems\nWe have three market-facing property-liability businesses, Allstate brand, National General and Answer Financial with products and services that cater to different customer preferences for advice and brand recognition.\nWe serve our consumers using differentiated products, analytical expertise, telematics and an integrated digital enterprise that leverages data and technology to execute processes with a focus on greater effectiveness and efficiency.\n4      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\nAdditional Information and Strategy Updates\nCommercial lines strategy\nWe remain focused on achieving sustainable growth and profitability in our shared economy commercial lines business, which is primarily comprised of transportation network companies. Traditional small business commercial insurance is being enhanced through new product development using technology to improve customer experience and reduce costs while leveraging enterprise capabilities. Profit improvement actions continue for our traditional commercial lines insurance products, emphasizing pricing, claims, governance and operational improvements.\nIndependent agent strategy\nThe acquisition of National General significantly enhanced our strategic position in the independent agency channel. The transaction increased our total personal property-liability market share by over one percentage point and has enhanced our independent agent-facing technology. It also expanded our distribution footprint, and led us to be a top five personal lines carrier in the independent agency distribution channel.\nNational General provides personal and commercial automobile, homeowners, umbrella, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, lender-placed property, health and other niche insurance products. Auto insurance represents approximately 60% of premium with a significant presence in the non-standard auto market. Allstate’s capabilities are being leveraged to create standard auto and homeowners insurance products to better serve mid-market customers through independent agents.\nAs part of the acquisition, Allstate Independent Agency and Encompass organizations are being integrated into National General by:\n•\nMigrating Encompass policyholders and business operations to National General and retiring Encompass infrastructure\n•\nTransitioning Allstate Independent Agent new business to National General as standard auto and homeowners insurance products roll out\nAnswer Financial strategy\nAnswer Financial is an insurance agency that sells other insurance companies’ products directly to customers online. Our strategy as a technology-enabled insurance agency is to provide comparison shopping and related services for businesses, offering customers choice, convenience and ease of use.\nAllstate Protection pricing and risk management strategies\nOur pricing and underwriting strategies and decisions are designed to generate sustainable profitable growth.\nA proprietary database of underwriting and loss experience enables sophisticated pricing algorithms and methodologies to more accurately price risks while also seeking to attract and retain customers in multiple risk segments.\n•\nFor auto insurance, risk evaluation factors can include, but are not limited to: vehicle make, model\nand year; driver age and marital status; territory; years licensed; loss history; years insured with prior carrier; prior liability limits; prior lapse in coverage; and insurance scoring utilizing telematics data and other consumer information.\n•\nFor property insurance, risk evaluation factors can include, but are not limited to: the amount of insurance purchased; geographic location of the property; loss history; age, condition and construction characteristics of the property; and characteristics of the insured including insurance scoring utilizing other consumer information.\nA combination of underwriting information, pricing and discounts are also used to achieve a more competitive position and growth. The pricing strategy involves local marketplace pricing and underwriting decisions based on risk evaluation factors to the extent permissible by applicable law and an evaluation of competitors.\nPricing of property products is intended to generate risk-adjusted returns that are acceptable over a long-term period. Rate increases are pursued to keep pace with loss trends, including losses from catastrophic events and those that are weather-related (such as wind, hail, lightning and freeze not meeting our criteria to be declared a catastrophe). We also take into consideration potential customer disruption, the impact on our ability to market our products, regulatory limitations, our competitive position and profitability.\nIn any reporting period, loss experience from catastrophic events and weather-related losses may contribute to negative or positive underwriting performance relative to the expectations incorporated into product pricing.\nProperty catastrophe exposure is managed with the goal of providing shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in the property business. Catastrophe exposure management includes purchasing reinsurance to provide coverage for known exposure to hurricanes, earthquakes and fires following earthquakes, wildfires and other catastrophes. Our current catastrophe reinsurance program supports our risk tolerance framework that targets less than a 1% likelihood of annual aggregate catastrophe losses from hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, excluding other catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, exceeding $2.5 billion.\nThe use of different assumptions and updates to industry models and to our risk transfer program could materially change the projected loss. Growth strategies include areas where we believe diversification can be enhanced and an appropriate return can be earned for the risk. As a result, our modeled exposure may increase, but in aggregate remain lower than $2.5 billion as noted above. In addition, we have exposure to other severe weather events, which impact catastrophe losses.\nThe Allstate Corporation      5\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nWe are promoting measures to prevent and mitigate losses that are increasing due to climate change and increased severe weather including making homes and communities more resilient,\nenforcement of stronger building codes, adoption of sensible land use policies and expanded disaster response capabilities.\nProducts and distribution\nAllstate Protection differentiates itself by offering a comprehensive range of affordable, simple and connected protection solutions across distribution channels for specific consumer segments.\n(1)\nInsurance products are offered by the Allstate and National General brands.\nAllstate exclusive agents also support the Protection Services and Allstate Health and Benefits segments through offering roadside assistance, consumer protection plans and voluntary benefits products. We have expanded the non-proprietary product suite to include a range of life insurance products offered by third-party providers.\nExclusive agent compensation structure\nThe compensation structure for Allstate exclusive agents rewards them for delivering high value to customers and achieving certain business outcomes such as profitable growth and household penetration. Allstate exclusive agent remuneration comprises a base commission, variable compensation and a bonus.\n•\nAgents receive a monthly base commission payment as a percentage of their total eligible written premium.\n•\nVariable compensation rewards agents for acquiring new customers by exceeding a base production goal.\n•\nBonus compensation is based on a percentage of premiums and can be earned by agents who are meeting certain sales goals and selling additional policies to meet customer needs profitably.\nVariable compensation in 2021 shifted toward new business, including homeowners, and eliminated variable compensation for renewing customers. We are aligning agent compensation to emphasize growth, improve customer service and lower costs.\nWhen an Allstate product is not available, agents have the ability to earn commissions and additional bonuses on non-proprietary products provided to customers through Ivantage, a leading provider of property and casualty brokerage services, and arrangements with other companies, agencies, and brokers. As of December 31, 2021, Ivantage had $1.98 billion non-proprietary premiums under management, consisting of approximately $1.75 billion of personal insurance premiums primarily related to property business in hurricane exposed areas, and approximately $230 million of commercial insurance premiums.\n6      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\nAdditionally, we offer a homeowners product through our excess and surplus lines carrier, North Light Specialty Insurance Company, in certain areas with higher risk of catastrophes or where customers do not meet the Allstate brand standard underwriting profile.\nAllstate agents and exclusive financial specialists receive commissions for non-proprietary life and retirement sales and are eligible for a quarterly bonus based on the volume of non-proprietary sales.\nIndependent agent remuneration for National General comprises a base commission and a bonus that can be earned by agents who achieve sales goals and a target loss ratio.\nThe Allstate Corporation      7\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nCompetition\nThe personal lines insurance markets, including private passenger auto and homeowners insurance, are highly competitive. The following charts provide Allstate Protection’s combined market share, inclusive of National General, compared to our principal U.S. competitors using statutory direct written premium for the year ended December 31, 2020, according to A.M. Best.\nGeographic markets\nWe primarily operate in the U.S (all 50 states and D.C.) and Canada. Our top geographic markets based on 2021 statutory direct premiums are reflected below.\n8      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\nProtection Services Segment\nOur Protection Services segment accounted for 4.7% of Allstate’s 2021 consolidated total revenue and 77.7% of Allstate’s December 31, 2021 PIF. Protection Services includes Allstate\nSM\nProtection Plans, Allstate Dealer Services\n®\n, Allstate Roadside, Arity\n®\nand\nAllstate\nSM\nIdentity Protection, which offer a broad range of products and services that expand and enhance customer value propositions. National General’s LeadCloud and Transparent.ly’s results are included within Arity starting in the first quarter of 2021. These businesses provide marketing and integration platforms connecting data buyers and sellers.\nStrategy\n- Protection Services’ strategy is to deliver innovative customer protection solutions and expand distribution through strategic partners in the flow of commerce.\nProducts and distribution\nGeographic markets\nProtection Services primarily operate in the U.S. and Canada, with Allstate Protection Plans also offering services in Europe, Australia and Asia.\nCompetition\nWe compete on a variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength, price and customer experience. The market for these services is highly fragmented and competitive.\nThe Allstate Corporation      9\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nAllstate Health and Benefits Segment\nStrategy\nOur Allstate Health and Benefits segment (previously Allstate Benefits) accounted for 4.5% of Allstate’s 2021 consolidated total revenue and 2.3% of Allstate’s December 31, 2021 PIF. The Allstate Health and Benefits segment provides consumers with financial protection against the risk of accidents, illness and mortality. We are among the industry leaders in the growing and highly competitive voluntary benefits market, offering a broad range of products through workplace enrollment. Our life insurance portfolio includes individual and group permanent life solutions. Target customers are middle market consumers with family and financial protection needs. Allstate Health and Benefits is well represented in all market segments and is a leader in the large and mega (over 10,000 employees) market segments.\nStarting in the first quarter of 2021, National General’s accident and health products, which include accident and medical health insurance products, are included in the Allstate Health and Benefits segment.\nAllstate Health and Benefits is differentiated through its broad product portfolio, flexible enrollment solutions, strong national accounts team and well-recognized brand.\nOur strategy for growth is to deliver substantially more value through innovative products and technology, tailored solutions and exceptional service through investments in future-state technologies and data and analytics capabilities.\nProducts and distribution\nCompetition\nWe compete on a wide variety of factors, including product offerings, brand recognition, financial strength and ratings, price, distribution and customer service.\nThe market for voluntary benefits is growing as these products help employees fill the increasing gaps associated with continued medical cost inflation and the shifting of costs from employers to employees to cover co-pays and deductibles. Favorable industry and economic trends have increased competitive pressure and attracted new traditional and non-traditional entrants to the voluntary benefits market. Recent entrants, including large group medical, life and disability insurance carriers, are leveraging core benefit capabilities by bundling and discounting to capture voluntary market share.\nGeographic markets\nWe primarily operate in the U.S. (all 50 states and D.C.) and Canada. The top geographic markets based on 2021 statutory direct premiums are reflected below.\n10      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\nOther Business Segments\nRun-off Property-Liability Segment\nThe Run-off Property-Liability segment includes results from property and casualty insurance coverage that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s.\nStrategy\nManagement of this segment has been assigned to a designated group of professionals with expertise in claims handling, policy coverage interpretation, exposure identification, litigation and reinsurance collection. As part of its responsibilities, this group may pursue settlement agreements including policy buybacks on direct excess commercial business when appropriate to improve the certainty of the liabilities. At the end of 2021, 70% of the direct excess gross case reserves were attributable to settlement agreements. This group also manages other direct commercial and assumed reinsurance business in runoff and engages in reinsurance ceded and assumed commutations as required or when considered economically advantageous.\nChanges in the reserves established for asbestos, environmental and other run-off lines losses have occurred and may continue. Reserve changes can be caused by new information relating to new and additional claims, new exposures or the impact of resolving unsettled claims based on unanticipated events such as arbitrations, litigation, legislative, judicial or regulatory actions. Environmental losses may also increase as the result of additional funding for environmental site clean-up.\nChallenges related to the concentration of insurance and reinsurance claims from companies who specialize in this business continue to be addressed.\nCorporate and Other Segment\nOur Corporate and Other segment is comprised of holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations, including expenses associated with strategic initiatives.\nThe Allstate Corporation      11\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nRegulation\nAllstate is subject to extensive regulation, primarily at the state level. The method, extent and substance of such regulation vary by state but generally have their source in statutes that establish standards and requirements for conducting the business of insurance and that also delegate regulatory authority to a state agency. These rules have a substantial effect on our business and relate to a wide variety of matters, including insurer solvency and statutory surplus sufficiency, reserve adequacy, insurance company licensing and examination, agent and adjuster licensing, agent and broker compensation, policy forms, rate setting, the nature and amount of investments, claims practices, participation in shared markets and guaranty funds, transactions with affiliates, the payment of dividends, underwriting standards, statutory accounting methods, trade practices, privacy regulation and data security, corporate governance and risk management. In addition, state legislators and insurance regulators continue to examine the appropriate nature and scope of state insurance regulation. For a discussion of statutory financial information, see Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements.\nFor a discussion of regulatory contingencies, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 15 and Note 17 are incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.\nThe Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank”) created the Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) within the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). The FIO monitors the insurance industry, provides advice to the Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”), represents the U.S. on international insurance matters, and studies the current regulatory system.\nAdditional regulations or new requirements may emerge from the activities of various regulatory entities, including the Federal Reserve Board, FIO, FSOC, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), and the International Association of Insurance Supervisors, that are evaluating solvency and capital standards for insurance company groups. In addition, the NAIC has adopted amendments to its model holding company law that have been adopted by some jurisdictions. The outcome of these actions is uncertain; however, these actions may result in an increase in the level of capital and liquidity required by insurance holding companies.\nWe cannot predict whether any specific state or federal measures will be adopted to change the nature or scope of the regulation of insurance or what effect any such measures would have on Allstate. We are working for changes in the regulatory environment to make insurance more available and affordable for customers, encourage market innovation, improve driving safety, strengthen cybersecurity and promote better catastrophe preparedness and loss mitigation.\nLimitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries\nAs a holding company with no significant\nbusiness operations of its own, The Allstate Corporation relies on dividends from Allstate Insurance Company as one of the principal sources of cash to pay dividends and to meet its obligations, including the payment of principal and interest on debt or to fund non-insurance-related businesses. Allstate Insurance Company is regulated as an insurance company in Illinois, and its ability to pay dividends is restricted by Illinois law. The laws of the other jurisdictions that generally govern our other insurance subsidiaries contain similar limitations on the payment of dividends. However, such laws in some jurisdictions may be more restrictive.\nFor additional information regarding limitations, see Part II, Item 7 - Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations of this report.\nIn addition, the NAIC formed a working group that has developed and adopted a group capital calculation covering all entities of the insurance company group for use in solvency monitoring activities. The calculation is intended to provide analytical information to regulators and we do not expect potential revisions to impact our current dividend plans. Any increase in the amount of capital or reserves our insurance subsidiaries are required to hold could reduce the amount of future dividends such subsidiaries are able to distribute to the holding company. Any reduction in the risk-based capital (“RBC”) ratios of our insurance subsidiaries could also adversely affect their financial strength ratings as determined by statistical rating agencies.\nInsurance Holding Company Regulation – Change of Control\nThe Allstate Corporation is a holding company and its insurance subsidiaries are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which they write business. In the U.S., these subsidiaries are organized under the insurance codes of Alabama, California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. Additionally, some of these subsidiaries are considered commercially domiciled in California and Florida.\nGenerally, the insurance codes in these states provide that the acquisition or change of “control” of a domestic or commercially domiciled insurer or of any person that controls such an insurer cannot be consummated without the prior approval of the relevant insurance regulator. In general, a presumption of “control” arises from the ownership, control, possession with the power to vote, or possession of proxies with respect to ten percent or more of the voting securities of an insurer or of a person who controls an insurer. In addition, certain state insurance laws require pre-acquisition notification to state agencies of a change in control with respect to a non-domestic insurance company licensed to do business in that state. While such pre-acquisition notification statutes do not authorize the state agency to disapprove the change of control, such statutes do authorize certain remedies, including the issuance of a cease-and-desist order with respect to the non-\n12      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\ndomestic insurer if certain conditions exist, such as undue market concentration.\nThus, any transaction involving the acquisition of ten percent or more of The Allstate Corporation’s common stock would generally require prior approval by the state insurance departments in Alabama (where the threshold is five percent or more of The Allstate Corporation’s common stock), California, Florida, Illinois, Indiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, South Carolina and Texas. Moreover, notification would be required in those other states that have adopted pre-acquisition notification provisions and where the insurance subsidiaries are admitted to transact business. Such approval requirements may deter, delay or prevent certain transactions affecting the ownership of The Allstate Corporation’s common stock.\nRate Regulation\nNearly all states have insurance laws requiring personal property and casualty insurers to file rating plans, policy or coverage forms, and other information with the state’s regulatory authority. In many cases, such rating plans, policy forms, or both must be approved prior to use.\nThe speed with which an insurer can change rates in response to competition or increasing costs depends on the state rating laws, which include the following categories:\n•\nPrior approval — Regulators must approve a rate before the insurer may use it (20 states)\n•\nFile-and-use — Insurers do not have to wait for the regulator’s approval to use a rate, but the rate must be filed with the regulatory authority prior to being used (19 states)\n•\nUse-and-file — Requires an insurer to file rates within a certain period of time after the insurer begins using them (10 states)\n•\nNo approval — One state, with an immaterial amount of written premiums, does not require a filing to be submitted\nUnder these rating laws, the regulator has the authority to disapprove a rate filing. The percentage of 2021 statutory direct written premiums based on state rating laws are reflected below.\nAn insurer’s ability to adjust its rates in response to competition or to changing costs is dependent on an insurer’s ability to demonstrate to the regulator that its rates or proposed rating plan meets the requirements of the rating laws. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s discretion in selecting the business that it wants to underwrite, an insurer can manage its risk of loss by charging a rate that reflects the cost and\nexpense of providing the insurance. In those states that significantly restrict an insurer’s ability to charge a rate that reflects the cost and expense of providing the insurance, the insurer can manage its risk of loss by being more selective in the type of business it underwrites. When a state significantly restricts both underwriting and pricing, it becomes more difficult for an insurer to maintain its targeted level of profitability.\nFrom time to time, the personal lines insurance industry comes under pressure from state regulators, legislators, and special-interest groups to reduce, freeze, or set rates at levels that do not correspond with our analysis of underlying costs, catastrophe loss exposure, and expenses. We expect this kind of pressure to persist. Allstate and other insurers are using increasingly sophisticated pricing models and rating plans that are reviewed by regulators and special-interest groups. State regulators may interpret existing law or rely on future legislation or regulations to impose new restrictions that adversely affect profitability or growth. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative and regulatory measures regarding insurance rates.\nInvoluntary Markets\nAs a condition of maintaining our licenses to write personal property and casualty insurance in various states, we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities, and joint underwriting associations that provide various types of insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to our results of operations.\nFor a discussion of these items see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 15 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.\nIndemnification Programs\nWe are a participant in state-based industry pools, facilities or associations, mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state, including the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”), the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association, the North Carolina Reinsurance Facility and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund. We also participate in the Federal Government National Flood Insurance Program.\nRecent regulatory changes have occurred related to the MCCA.\n•\nOn August 6, 2020, member companies of the MCCA were notified of the ratification of amendments to the MCCA’s Plan of Operation. The amendments were designed to align the Plan of Operation with Public Acts 21 and 22, which passed in 2019.\n•\nOn July 2, 2020, portions of Public Acts 21 and 22 went into effect. The changes under those laws include:\n–\nAllowing insureds to choose levels of personal injury protection coverage, including the option\nThe Allstate Corporation      13\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nto opt-out of personal injury protection coverage in certain circumstances.\n–\nImplementing mandated rate reductions that correspond to the level of personal injury protection coverage chosen by insureds.\n–\nImplementing or creating new processes for reviewing claims, assessing allowable expenses and setting limits on certain allowable expenses.\n•\nOn July 2, 2021, legislation passed in 2019 became effective, setting fee schedules for personal injury protection claims. Such fee schedules were set at 200% of Medicare rates in 2021, declining to 195% in 2022 and 190% in 2023, for any providers other than certain unique categories of providers and applying to treatment on existing and new claims.\n•\nOther legislative proposals to change the MCCA operation in the future and to adjust Public Acts 21 and 22 are put forth periodically.\nFor a discussion of these items see Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements. Note 11 is incorporated in this Part I, Item 1 by reference.\nGuaranty Funds\nUnder state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, in order to cover certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies. We do not anticipate any material adverse financial impact on Allstate from these assessments.\nInvestment Regulation\nOur insurance subsidiaries are subject to state regulation that specifies the types of investments that can be made and concentration limits of invested assets. Failure to comply with these rules leads to the treatment of non-conforming investments as non-admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus. Further, in some instances, these rules require divestiture of non-conforming investments.\nExiting Geographic Markets; Canceling and Non-Renewing Policies\nMost states regulate an insurer’s ability to exit a market. For example, states may limit, to varying degrees, an insurer’s ability to cancel and non-renew policies. Some states restrict or prohibit an insurer from withdrawing one or more types of insurance business from the state, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Regulations that limit cancellation and non-renewal and that subject withdrawal plans to prior approval requirements may restrict an insurer’s ability to exit unprofitable markets.\nBroker-Dealers and Investment Advisers\nThe Allstate entities that operate as broker-dealers and registered investment advisers are subject to regulation and supervision by the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), Financial Institution Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) and/or, in some cases, state securities administrators. Certain state and federal regulators are considering or have implemented best interest or fiduciary standards. Such standards could impact products provided by Allstate agents and Allstate’s broker-dealers, their sales\nprocesses, sales volume, and producer compensation arrangements.\nDodd-Frank: Covered Agreement\nThe Secretary of the Treasury (operating through FIO) and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (“USTR”) are jointly authorized, pursuant to the Dodd-Frank, to negotiate Covered Agreements. A Covered Agreement is a bilateral or multilateral agreement that “relates to the recognition of prudential measures with respect to the business of insurance or reinsurance that achieves a level of protection for insurance or reinsurance consumers that is substantially equivalent to the level of protection achieved under State insurance or reinsurance regulation.”\nOn September 22, 2017, the U.S. and European Union (“EU”) signed a Covered Agreement. In addition to signing the Covered Agreement, Treasury and the USTR jointly issued a policy statement clarifying how the U.S. views implementation of certain provisions of the Covered Agreement. The policy statement affirms the U.S. system of insurance regulation, including the role of state insurance regulators as the primary supervisors of the business of insurance and addresses several other key provisions of the Covered Agreement for which constituents sought clarity, including prospective application to reinsurance agreements and an affirmation that the Covered Agreement does not require development of a group capital standard or group capital requirement in the U.S.\nThe U.S. has five years from the date of signing to amend its credit for reinsurance laws and regulations to conform with the requirements of the Covered Agreement or face federal preemption determinations by the FIO. To address the requirements of the Covered Agreement, the NAIC has formally adopted revisions to its existing credit for reinsurance model law and model regulation to conform with the requirements of the Covered Agreement with the expectation that states will adopt and implement the modified model law and regulation by September 2022.\nOn December 19, 2018, the U.S. and the United Kingdom (“UK”) signed a separate Covered Agreement consistent with the U.S.-EU Covered Agreement to coordinate regulation of the insurance industry doing business in the U.S. and UK. Consistent with the U.S.-EU Covered Agreement (the “Agreement”) signed in 2017, Treasury and the USTR also issued a policy statement regarding implementation of the Agreement affirming the role that state insurance regulators play as the primary supervisors of the U.S. insurance industry.\nDivision Statute\nOn November 27, 2018, the Illinois General Assembly passed legislation authorizing a statute that makes available a process by which a domestic insurance company may divide into two or more domestic insurance companies. The statute, which became effective January 1, 2019, can be used to divide continuing blocks of insurance business from insurance business no longer marketed, or otherwise has been discontinued, into separate companies with separate capital. The statute can also be used for sale\n14      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\nto a third party or to manage risks associated with indemnification programs. Before a plan of division can be effected it must be approved according to the organizational documents of the dividing insurer and submitted for approval by the Illinois Department of Insurance.\nPrivacy Regulation and Data Security\nFederal law and the laws of many states require financial institutions to protect the security and confidentiality of consumer information and to notify consumers about their policies and practices relating to collection, use, and disclosure of consumer information and their policies relating to protecting the security and confidentiality of that information. Federal law and the laws of many states also regulate disclosures and disposal of consumer information. Congress, state legislatures, and regulatory authorities are expected to consider additional regulation relating to privacy and other aspects of consumer information.\nFor example, the California Consumer Privacy Act, which took effect in January 2020, adopted significant compliance requirements for businesses that collect personal information on California residents. In addition, the California Privacy Rights Act, which expands consumer privacy rights and establishes a new privacy regulatory agency, was passed in November 2020 and will become effective in January 2023. Further, the New York State Department of Financial Services cybersecurity regulation and the NAIC Insurance Data Security Model Law, which has been adopted in some form by several states, establish standards for data security and for the investigation of and notification to insurance commissioners of cybersecurity events. Additional states are also likely to adopt similarly themed cybersecurity requirements in the future. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding privacy or cybersecurity.\nAsbestos\nCongress has repeatedly considered legislation to address asbestos claims and litigation in the past. We cannot predict the impact on our business of possible future legislative measures regarding asbestos.\nEnvironmental\nEnvironmental pollution and clean-up of polluted waste sites is the subject of federal and state regulation. The Comprehensive Environmental Response Compensation and Liability Act of 1980 (the “Superfund”) and comparable state statutes (the “mini-Superfunds”) govern the clean-up and restoration of waste sites by Potentially Responsible Parties (“PRPs”). The Superfund and the mini-Superfunds (collectively, the “Environmental Clean-up Laws” or “ECLs”) establish a mechanism to assign liability to PRPs or to fund the clean-up of waste sites if PRPs fail to do so. The extent of liability to be allocated to a PRP depends on a variety of factors. The insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues arising out of the clean-up of waste sites by insured PRPs and the insured parties’ alleged liability to third parties responsible for the clean-up. The insurance industry, including Allstate, has disputed and is disputing many such claims. Key coverage issues include whether the\nSuperfund response, investigation, and clean-up costs are considered damages under the policies; whether coverage has been triggered; whether any pollution exclusion applies; whether there has been proper notice of claims; whether administrative liability triggers the duty to defend; whether there is an appropriate allocation of liability among potentially responsible insurers; and whether the liability in question falls within the definition of an “occurrence.” Identical coverage issues exist for clean-up and waste sites not covered under the Superfund. To date, courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues.\nAllstate’s exposure to liability with regard to its insureds that have been, or may be, named as PRPs is uncertain. While comprehensive Superfund reform proposals have been introduced in Congress, only modest reform measures have been enacted. In May 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency created a Superfund Task Force that issued proposed reforms in a July 2018 report. These recommendations address expediting clean-up and remediation processes, reducing the financial burden of the clean-up process, encouraging private investment, promoting redevelopment and community revitalization, and building and strengthening partnerships. We cannot predict which, if any, of these reforms will be enacted.\nDevelopments in the insurance and reinsurance industries have fostered a movement to segregate asbestos, environmental and other run-off lines exposures into separate legal entities with dedicated capital. Regulatory bodies in certain cases have supported these actions. We are unable to determine the impact, if any, that these developments will have on the collectability of reinsurance recoverables in the future.\nThe Allstate Corporation      15\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1. Business\nHuman Capital\nAllstate’s success is highly dependent on human capital. The wellbeing of our employees is a key priority, and Allstate strives to promote a dynamic and welcoming workplace that promotes inclusive diversity and equity, fosters collaboration, and encourages employees to bring their best ideas to work every day. As of December 31, 2021, Allstate had approximately 54,300 full-time employees and 400 part-time employees.\nAllstate’s human capital management focuses on the following priorities:\nInclusive Diversity and Equity (“IDE”)\nWe strive for a workforce where the breadth of our diversity makes us a better company. IDE is one of Allstate’s core values and serves as a foundation of Our Shared Purpose.\n•\nWe track our workforce composition data over time to determine if we are making appropriate progress in advancing gender and racial representation in our employee population and we disclose our progress. In our Sustainability Report, we provide, among other things, five years of workforce composition data that shows a breakdown of salaried, hourly and management employees by gender and race. Beginning in 2021 we also disclosed our EEO-1 data.\n•\nAs part of our commitment to fair and equitable compensation practices, we complete an annual pay equity analysis. We partner with external law and data analytics firms to provide a more detailed analysis to identify potential pay gaps across substantially similar employee groups as well as identify policies, practices or systematic issues that may contribute to pay gaps now or over time. The external analyses found that Allstate’s results compared well to benchmarks for companies of similar size and scope.\n•\nAllstate’s Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) Program and the Enterprise Diversity Leadership Council (“EDLC”) help advance IDE.\n–\nERGs: Allstate has 11 ERGs that offer specific opportunities for employees to partner and collaborate with each other through professional development workshops, recruiting events, volunteer projects and mentoring. Officers from across the enterprise leverage their time, networks and resources to support the ERGs and positively impact employee engagement and feelings of belonging at Allstate.\n–\nEDLC: The EDLC is made up of senior leaders throughout the organization and focuses on driving targeted results for IDE by identifying and prioritizing action, taking accountability\nfor achieving targeted results and ensuring clarity and understanding of the business relevance of IDE. The EDLC provides updates to our chief executive officer.\n•\nIn 2021, employees completed more than 106,000 IDE courses, more than triple the number completed in 2020.\n•\nAllstate continues to look for ways to build awareness and drive action to be a differentiated leader in IDE. In 2021, we:\n–\nContinued to drive skills-based hiring without degree requirements on job postings. 54% of all new hires in 2021 did not have a 4-year bachelor’s degree.\n–\nBegan conducting a top-to-bottom review of IDE practices within Allstate, which will continue in 2022.\n–\nRolled out the IDE Strategy with Culture, People, Business Practices, and Community as the four pillars.\n–\nLaunched IDE Dashboard with representation data and goals to guide business practices and increase transparency.\nEmployee Wellbeing and Safety\nWe take seriously our responsibility to care for employees’ well-being, devoting resources to employee health and safety.\n•\nAllstate responded quickly and decisively to the pandemic. To prioritize safety, we transitioned 95% of our workforce to work from home and established comprehensive safety protocols for those who continued to work in-person.\n•\nAllstate established and continues to utilize strong guiding principles to drive our response to the pandemic. These principles include complying with regulations, relying on expert medical advice, adapting our approach to individual circumstances, and keeping our employees, agents, and customers safe.\n•\nAs part of the Good Office program, we ship essential office items to our employees to help them work more productively at home and are establishing a new hire bundle to ensure all new employees start with the remote technology they need.\n•\nWe conduct wellbeing assessments to solicit employee feedback about physical, emotional, mental and financial wellbeing. Completing the assessment lowers the cost of benefits to employees.\n•\nWe offer resilience and stress management programs, including Energy for Life, designed to help employees articulate and pursue their individual purpose and embrace new challenges with ease. Over 39,000 employees have taken this wellness workshop since 2010.\n16      www.allstate.com\nItem 1. Business\n2021 Form 10-K\n•\nThe ERGs provided multiple forums in 2021 to share wellness resources and support for their members.\n•\nWellbeing Champions promote Allstate’s health and wellness resources across the enterprise, including yoga and meditation classes.\nTalent Recruitment and Management\nWe seek to provide employees with rewarding work, professional growth and educational opportunities.\n•\nOur flexible work and equal opportunity policies support talent attraction and retention. In early 2021 we conducted research with employees to learn more about their work location preferences. Ultimately 75% of our workforce will remain home-based workers permanently, 24% hybrid, and due to roles, 1% will be fully office-based. This remote-first strategy has enabled us to recruit a more geographically dispersed and diverse talent pool, as well as to reevaluate our facilities footprint.\n•\nPerformance review and development takes place throughout the year. Allstate invests in training and re-skilling opportunities, with most of our learning experiences offered virtually to support our remote and global workforce.\n•\nIn 2021:\n–\nEmployees completed over 154,000 hours in formal learning opportunities.\n–\nOver 7,000 employees participated in Allstate’s Global Learning month, which included speaking events with industry leaders.\n–\nOver 4,000 employees attended Quarterly Skill Builders featuring external experts facilitating topics including building a culture of feedback, collaboration, challenging ideas and providing clarity.\n–\n734 employees participated in Allstate’s tuition reimbursement program, with $2.9 million paid in tuition reimbursement.\n–\n31% of open positions were filled with internal applicants.\nOrganizational Culture\nAt Allstate, we believe that when your passion fuels your purpose, you can achieve anything. We expect all employees to be leaders and dedicate extensive resources to developing leaders at all levels.\n•\nAllstate defines culture as a self-sustaining system of shared values, priorities and principles that shape beliefs and drive behaviors and decision-making within an organization.\n•\nIn 2020, we updated Our Shared Purpose to reflect the evolution of our culture to drive our business strategy. In 2021 we focused on further embedding Our Shared Purpose into the employee experience, including in our recruiting and hiring practices, performance management, learning and development offerings, leadership development and employee feedback and measurement.\nFor additional information, please see the section titled “Human Capital Management” in our 2021 Proxy Statement.\nIn addition to the above discussion of our employees, please see information about Allstate agents under the caption “Allstate Protection Segment - Products and Distribution” in Part I, Item 1 of this report.\nThe Allstate Corporation      17\n2021 Form 10-K\nItem 1.

    "text": "Summary\nRisks are categorized by (1) insurance and financial services, (2) business, strategy and operations and (3) macro, regulatory and risk environment. Many risks may affect more than one category and are included where the impact is most significant. If some of these risk factors occur, they may cause the emergence of or exacerbate the impact of other risk factors, which could materially increase the severity of the impact of these risks on our business, results of operations, financial condition or liquidity. The table below includes examples of risks from each category.\nThe Allstate Corporation Board of Directors (“Allstate Board”) has overall responsibility for oversight of Management’s design and implementation of our Enterprise Risk and Return Management (“ERRM”) framework that manages risk on an integrated basis following our risk and return principles. The Risk and Return Committee of the Allstate Board oversees effectiveness of the ERRM program, governance structure and risk-related decision-making, while focusing on the Company’s overall risk profile.\nSee Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”), Enterprise Risk and Return Management for further details.\nConsider these cautionary statements carefully together with other factors discussed elsewhere in this document, in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) or in materials incorporated therein by reference.\nUnexpected increases in the frequency or severity of property and casualty claims may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nA significant increase in claim frequency could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition. Changes in mix of business, miles driven, weather, distracted driving or other factors can lead to changes in claim frequency. We may experience volatility in claim frequency, and short-term trends may not be predictive of future losses over the longer term.\nIncreases in claim severity can arise from numerous causes that are inherently difficult to predict. The following factors have and may continue to impact claim severity for auto bodily injury, property damage and homeowners coverages:\n•\nBodily injury — inflation in medical costs, duration of treatment, litigation trends and precedents and regulation\n•\nVehicle property damage — inflation in repair costs, including parts and labor rates, mix of total losses declared, costs associated with repairing\nsophisticated newer vehicles, model year and used-car values\n•\nHomeowners — inflation in the construction industry, building materials and home furnishings, changes in the mix of loss type, and other economic and environmental factors, including short-term supply imbalances for services and supplies in areas affected by catastrophes\nCatastrophes and severe weather events may subject us to significant losses\nCatastrophic events could adversely affect operating results and cause them to vary significantly from one period to the next. Also, our liquidity could be constrained by a catastrophe, or multiple catastrophes, which could result in extraordinary losses, sales of investments or a downgrade of our debt or financial strength ratings.\nCatastrophic losses are caused by wind and hail, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, severe freeze events, volcanic eruptions, terrorism, cyber-attacks, civil unrest, industrial accidents and other such events.\nOur personal property insurance business may incur catastrophe losses greater than:\n•\nThose experienced in prior years\n•\nThe average expected level used in pricing\nThe Allstate Corporation      21\n2021 Form 10-K\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\n•\nCurrent reinsurance coverage limits\n•\nLoss estimates from hurricane and earthquake models at various levels of probability\nProperty and casualty businesses are subject to claims arising from severe weather events such as winter storms, rain, hail and high winds. The incidence and severity of weather conditions resulting in claims are extremely volatile.\nThe total number of policyholders affected by the event, the severity of the event and the coverage provided contribute to catastrophe and severe weather losses. Increases in the insured values of covered property, geographic concentration and the number of policyholders exposed to certain events could increase the severity of claims from catastrophic and severe weather events.\nLimitations in analytical models used to assess and predict the exposure to catastrophe losses may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nWe use internally developed and third-party vendor models along with our own historical data to assess exposure to catastrophe losses. The models assume various conditions and probability scenarios and may not accurately predict future losses or measure losses currently incurred.\nPrice competition and changes in regulation and underwriting standards in property and casualty businesses may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nThe personal property-liability market is highly competitive with carriers competing through underwriting, advertising, price, customer service, innovation and distribution. Changes in regulatory standards regarding underwriting and rates could also affect the ability to predict future losses and could impact profitability. Companies can alter underwriting standards, lower prices and increase advertising, which could result in lower growth or profitability for Allstate. A decline in the growth or profitability of the property and casualty businesses could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nProperty and casualty actual claims costs may exceed current reserves established for claims due to changes in the inflationary, regulatory and litigation environment\nEstimating claim reserves is an inherently uncertain and complex process. We continually refine our best estimates of losses after considering known facts and interpretations of the circumstances.\nOur reserving methodology may be impacted by the following:\n•\nModels that rely on the assumption that past loss development patterns will persist into the future\n•\nInternal factors including experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns, pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix, contractual terms and changes in claim reporting and settlement practices\n•\nExternal factors such as inflation, court decisions, changes in law or litigation imposing unintended coverage, regulatory requirements, changes in driving patterns and economic conditions\n•\nSupply chain disruptions and labor shortages could increase the cost of settling claims\n•\nThe ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded reserves and such variance may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition as the reserves and amounts due from reinsurers are reestimated.\nSee MD&A, Application of Critical Accounting Estimates for further details.\nOur investment portfolios are subject to market risk and declines in quality which may adversely affect or create volatility in our investment income and cause realized and unrealized losses\nWe continually evaluate investment management strategies since we are subject to risk of loss due to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, real estate values, currency exchange rates and liquidity. Adverse changes may occur due to changes in monetary and fiscal policy and the economic climate, liquidity of a market or market segment, investor return expectations or risk tolerance, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants, or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness. Adverse changes in market conditions could cause the value of our investments to decrease significantly and impact our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur investments are subject to risks associated with economic and capital market conditions and factors that may be unique to our portfolio, including:\n•\nGeneral weakening of the economy, which is typically reflected through higher credit spreads and lower equity and real estate valuations\n•\nDeclines in credit quality\n•\nDeclines in market interest rates, credit spreads or sustained low interest rates could lead to further declines in portfolio yields and investment income\n•\nIncreases in market interest rates, credit spreads or a decrease in liquidity could have an adverse effect on the value of our fixed income securities that form a substantial majority of our investment portfolios\n•\nSupply chain disruptions, labor shortages and other factors have and may continue to increase inflation, which could have an adverse impact on investment valuations and returns.\n•\nWeak performance of general and joint venture partners and underlying investments unrelated to general market or economic conditions could lead to declines in investment income and cause realized losses in our limited partnership interests\n•\nConcentration in any particular issuer, industry, collateral type, group of related industries, geographic sector or risk type\n22      www.allstate.com\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe amount and timing of net investment income, capital contributions and distributions from our performance-based investments, which primarily include limited partnership interests, can fluctuate significantly due to the underlying investments’ performance or changes in market or economic conditions. Additionally, these investments are less liquid than similar, publicly-traded investments and a decline in market liquidity could impact our ability to sell them at their current carrying values.\nDeclining equity markets or increases in interest rates or credit spreads could cause the value of the investments in our pension plans to decrease. Declines in interest rates could cause the funding ratio to decline and the value of the obligations for our pension and postretirement plans to increase. These factors could decrease the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans, increasing the likelihood or magnitude of future benefit expense and contributions.\nDetermination of the fair value and amount of credit losses for investments includes subjective judgments and could materially impact our results of operations and financial condition\nThe valuation of the portfolio is subjective, and the value of assets may differ from the actual amount received upon the sale of an asset. The degree of judgment required in determining fair values increases when:\n•\nMarket observable information is less readily available\n•\nThe use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the assets’ fair values\n•\nChanging market conditions could materially affect the fair value of investments\nThe determination of the amount of credit losses varies by investment type and is based on ongoing evaluation and assessment of known and inherent risks associated with the respective asset class or investment.\nSuch evaluations and assessments are highly judgmental and are revised as conditions change and new information becomes available.\nWe update our evaluations regularly and reflect changes in credit losses in our results of operations. Our conclusions may ultimately prove to be incorrect as assumptions, facts and circumstances change. Historical loss trends, consideration of current conditions, and forecasts may not be indicative of future changes in credit losses and additional amounts may need to be recorded in the future.\nOur participation in indemnification programs subjects us to the risk that reimbursement for qualifying claims and claims expenses may not be received\nParticipation in state-based industry pools, facilities and associations as well as the National Flood Insurance Program may have a material, adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition. Our largest exposure is associated with the Michigan\nCatastrophic Claim Association (“MCCA”), a state-mandated indemnification mechanism for qualified personal injury protection losses that exceed a specified level. To the extent the MCCA’s current and future assessments are insufficient to reimburse its ultimate obligation on existing claims to member companies, our ability to obtain the 100% indemnification of ultimate loss could be impaired.\nFor further discussion of these items, see Regulation section, Indemnification Programs and Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.\nWe may not be able to mitigate the impact associated with changes in capital requirements\nRegulatory requirements affect the amount of capital to be maintained by our subsidiary insurance companies. Changes to requirements or regulatory interpretations may result in additional capital held in our insurance companies and could require us to increase prices, reduce our sales of certain products, or accept a return on equity below original levels assumed in pricing.\nA downgrade in financial strength ratings may have an adverse effect on our business\nFinancial strength ratings are important factors in establishing the competitive position of insurance companies and their access to capital markets. Rating agencies could downgrade or change the outlook on our ratings due to:\n•\nChanges in the financial profile of one of our insurance companies\n•\nChanges in a rating agency’s determination of the amount of capital required to maintain a particular rating\n•\nIncreases in the perceived risk of our investment portfolio, a reduced confidence in management or our business strategy, or other considerations that may or may not be under our control\nA downgrade in our ratings could have an adverse effect on our sales, competitiveness, customer retention, the marketability of our product offerings, liquidity, access to and cost of borrowing, results of operations and financial condition.\nWe operate in markets that are highly competitive and may be impacted by new or changing technologies\nMarkets in which we operate are highly competitive, and we must continually allocate resources to refine and improve products and services to remain competitive. If we are unsuccessful in generating new business, retaining customers or renewing contracts, our ability to maintain or increase premiums written or the ability to sell our products could be adversely impacted.\nDetermining competitive position is complicated in the auto and homeowners insurance business as\nThe Allstate Corporation      23\n2021 Form 10-K\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\ncompanies use different underwriting standards to accept new customers and quotes and close rates can fluctuate across companies and locations. Pricing of products is driven by multiple factors, including loss expectations, expense structure and dissimilar return targets. Additionally, sophisticated pricing algorithms make it difficult to determine what price potential customers would pay across competitors.\nThere is also significant competition for producers, such as exclusive and independent agents and their licensed sales professionals. Growth and retention may be materially affected if we are unable to attract and retain effective producers or if those producers are unable to attract and retain their licensed sales professionals or customers. Similarly, growth and retention may be impacted if customer preferences change and we are unable to effectively adapt our business model and processes.\nOur business could also be affected by technological changes, such as autonomous or partially autonomous vehicles or technologies that facilitate ride, car or home sharing. Such changes could disrupt the demand for products from current customers, create coverage issues, impact the frequency or severity of losses, or reduce the size of the automobile insurance market causing our auto insurance business to decline. Since auto insurance constitutes a significant portion of our overall business, we may be more sensitive than other insurers and more adversely affected by trends that could decrease auto insurance rates or reduce demand for auto insurance over time.\nTechnological advancements and innovation are occurring in distribution, underwriting, claims and operations at a rapid pace that may continue to accelerate. Nontraditional competitors could enter the insurance market and further accelerate these trends. Innovations must be implemented in compliance with applicable insurance regulations and may require extensive modifications to our systems and processes and extensive coordination with and reliance on the systems and operations of third parties. If we are unable to adapt to or bring such advancements and innovations to market, the quality of our products, our relationships with customers and agents, competitive position and business prospects may be materially affected. Changes in technology related to collection and application of data regarding customers could expose us to regulatory or legal actions and may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, results of operations and financial condition.\nTechnology and customer preference changes may impact the ways in which we interact, do business with our customers and design our products. We may not be able to respond effectively to these changes, which could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nOur ability to adequately and effectively price our products and services is affected by the evolving nature of consumer needs and preferences, market and regulatory dynamics, broader use of telematics-based rate segmentation and potential reduction in consumer demand.\nMany voluntary benefits contracts are renewed annually. There is a risk that employers may be able to obtain more favorable terms from competitors than they could by renewing coverage with us. These competitive pressures may adversely affect the renewal of these contracts, as well as our ability to sell products.\nTransformative Growth strategy implementation may not be effective\nThe Transformative Growth strategy is to accelerate growth by expanding customer access, improving customer value, increasing the level and sophistication of new customer acquisition and deploying new technology applications. The strategy encompasses all aspects of Allstate’s customer experience and business model, spanning product distribution and sales, operations and servicing, and claims processing. If the strategy is not implemented effectively, customer retention and policy growth objectives could be adversely impacted. Lost business opportunities may result due to slower than anticipated speed to market. External forces including competitor actions or regulatory changes may also have an adverse effect on the value generated from the transformation.\nOur catastrophe management strategy may adversely affect premium growth\nCatastrophe risk management actions have negatively impacted the size of our homeowners business and customer retention, including customers with auto and other personal lines products and may negatively impact future sales if further actions are taken. Adjustments to our business structure, size and underwriting practices in markets with significant severe weather and catastrophe risk exposure could adversely impact premium growth rates and retention.\nThe ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends may affect our liquidity and ability to meet our obligations\nThe Allstate Corporation is a holding company with no significant operations. Its principal assets are the stock of its subsidiaries and its directly held cash and investment portfolios. Its liabilities include debt and pension and other postretirement benefit obligations related to Allstate Insurance Company employees. State insurance regulatory authorities limit the payment of dividends by insurance subsidiaries, as described in Note 17 of the consolidated financial statements. The limitations are based on statutory income and surplus. In addition, competitive pressures generally require the subsidiaries to maintain insurance financial strength ratings. These restrictions and other regulatory requirements may affect the ability of subsidiaries to make dividend payments. Limits on the ability of the subsidiaries to pay dividends could adversely affect holding company liquidity, including the ability to pay dividends to shareholders, service debt or complete share repurchase programs as planned.\n24      www.allstate.com\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\n2021 Form 10-K\nChanges in regulatory or rating agency capital requirements could decrease deployable capital and potentially reduce future dividends paid by our insurance companies.\nFor a discussion of capital requirements, including a potential change to a group capital calculation, see Regulation section, Limitations on Dividends by Insurance Subsidiaries.\nOur ability to pay dividends or repurchase stock is subject to limitations under terms of certain of our securities\nThe terms of the outstanding subordinated debentures prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nWe are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our Series G preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or shareholders’ equity levels. The prohibition is subject to an exception permitting us to declare dividends out of the net proceeds of common stock issued by us during the 90 days before the date of declaration even if we fail to meet such levels.\nIf the full preferred stock dividends for all preceding dividend periods have not been declared and paid, we generally may not repurchase or pay dividends on common stock during any dividend period while our preferred stock is outstanding.\nSee Note 13 of the consolidated financial statements.\nReinsurance may be unavailable at current levels and prices, which may limit our ability to write new business\nMarket conditions beyond our control impact the availability and cost of the reinsurance we purchase. Reinsurance may not remain continuously available to us to the same extent and on the same terms and rates as is currently available. Our ability to economically justify reinsurance to reduce our catastrophe risk in designated areas may depend on our ability to adjust premium rates to fully or partially recover cost. If we cannot maintain our current level of reinsurance or purchase new reinsurance protection in amounts we consider sufficient at acceptable prices, we would have to either accept an increase in our catastrophe exposure, reduce our insurance exposure or seek other alternatives.\nReinsurance subjects us to counterparty risk and may not be adequate to protect us against losses arising from ceded insurance\nCollecting from reinsurers is subject to uncertainty arising from factors that include:\n•\nWhether reinsurers, their affiliates or certain indemnitors have the financial capacity and willingness to make payments under the terms of a reinsurance treaty or contract\n•\nWhether insured losses meet the qualifying conditions of the reinsurance contract\nOur inability to recover from a reinsurer could have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nDisruption, volatility or uncertainty in the insurance linked securities market may decrease our ability to access such market on favorable terms or at all.\nAcquisitions or divestitures of businesses may not produce anticipated benefits, resulting in operating difficulties, unforeseen liabilities or asset impairments\nThe ability to achieve certain anticipated financial benefits from the acquisition of businesses depends in part on our ability to successfully grow and integrate the businesses consistent with our anticipated acquisition economics. Financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, unforeseen liabilities, transaction-related charges, diversion of management time and resources to acquisition integration challenges or growth strategies, loss of key employees, challenges in integrating information technology systems of acquired companies with our own, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets or goodwill and indemnifications.\nAcquired businesses may not perform as projected, cost savings anticipated from the acquisition may not materialize, and costs associated with the integration may be greater than anticipated. As a result, if we do not manage these transitions effectively, the quality of our products as well as our relationships with customers and partners may result in the company not achieving returns on its investment at the level projected at acquisition.\nWe also may divest businesses from time to time. These transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through reinsurance, guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. If the acquiring companies do not perform under the arrangements, our financial results could be negatively impacted.\nWe may be subject to the risks and costs associated with intellectual property infringement, misappropriation and third-party claims\nWe rely on a combination of contractual rights and copyright, trademark, patent and trade secret laws to establish and protect our intellectual property. Third parties may infringe or misappropriate our intellectual property. We may have to litigate to enforce and protect intellectual property and to determine its scope, validity or enforceability, which could divert significant resources and prove unsuccessful. An inability to protect intellectual property or an inability to successfully defend against a claim of intellectual property infringement could have a material effect on our business.\nWe may be subject to claims by third parties for patent, trademark or copyright infringement or breach of usage rights. Any such claims and any resulting\nThe Allstate Corporation      25\n2021 Form 10-K\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\nlitigation could result in significant expense and liability. If third-party providers or we are found to have infringed a third-party intellectual property right, either of us could be enjoined from providing certain products or services or from utilizing and benefiting from certain methods, processes, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets or licenses. Alternatively, we could be required to enter into costly licensing arrangements with third parties or implement costly work-arounds. Any of these scenarios could have a material effect on our business and results of operations.\nConditions in the global economy and capital markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations\nGlobal economic and capital market conditions could adversely impact demand for our products, returns on our investment portfolio and results of operations. The conditions that would have the largest impact on our business include:\n•\nLow or negative economic growth\n•\nInterest rate levels\n•\nRising inflation increasing claims and claims expense\n•\nSubstantial increases in delinquencies or defaults on debt\n•\nSignificant downturns in the market value or liquidity of our investment portfolio\n•\nReduced consumer spending and business investment\nStressed conditions, volatility and disruptions in global capital markets or financial asset classes could adversely affect our investment portfolio.\nAdverse capital and credit market conditions may significantly affect our ability to meet liquidity needs or obtain credit on acceptable terms\nIn periods of extreme volatility and disruption in the capital and credit markets, liquidity and credit capacity may be severely restricted. Our access to additional financing depends on a variety of factors such as market conditions, the general availability of credit, the overall availability of credit to our industry, our credit ratings and credit capacity, as well as lenders’ perception of our long- or short-term financial prospects. In such circumstances, our ability to obtain capital to fund operating expenses, financing costs, capital expenditures or acquisitions may be limited, and the cost of any such capital may be significant.\nA large-scale pandemic, the occurrence of terrorism, military actions, social unrest or other actions may have an adverse effect on our business\nA large-scale pandemic, such as the Coronavirus and its impacts, the occurrence of terrorism, military actions, social unrest or other actions, may result in loss of life, property damage, and disruptions to\ncommerce and reduced economic activity. Some of the assets in our investment portfolio may be adversely affected by declines in the equity markets, changes in interest rates, reduced liquidity and economic activity caused by a large-scale pandemic. Additionally, a large-scale pandemic or terrorist act could have a material effect on sales, liquidity and operating results.\nThe Coronavirus resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, government-imposed shelter-in-place orders, quarantine periods, social distancing, and restrictions on large gatherings. These measures moderated in 2021 in certain locations as vaccines became more widely available in the United States and Canada. There is no way of predicting with certainty how long the pandemic might last. New variants of the Coronavirus may impact the potential for restrictions being restored or new restrictions being implemented that could result in further economic volatility. We continue to closely monitor and proactively adapt to developments and changing conditions. Currently, it is not possible to reliably estimate the impact to our operations, but the effects could be material.\nThe Coronavirus has affected our operations and may continue to significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity, including:\n•\nSales of new and retention of existing policies\n•\nPremium for transportation network products\n•\nSupply chain disruptions and labor shortages increase the cost of settling claims\n•\nHospital and outpatient claim costs\n•\nInvestment valuations and returns\n•\nBad debt and credit allowance exposure\n•\nConsumer utilization of Milewise®, our pay-per-mile insurance product\n•\nRetail sales in Allstate Protection Plans\nSee MD&A, Highlights for a summary of the impacts of the Coronavirus on our operations, each of our segments and investments that may continue, emerge, evolve or accelerate into 2022.\nThe failure in cyber or other information security controls, as well as the occurrence of events unanticipated in our disaster recovery processes and business continuity planning, could result in a loss or disclosure of confidential information, damage to our reputation, additional costs and impair our ability to conduct business effectively\nWe depend heavily on computer systems, mathematical algorithms and data to perform necessary business functions. There are threats that could impact our ability to protect our data and systems; if the threats are successful, they could impact confidentiality, integrity and availability:\n•\nConfidentiality — protecting our data from disclosure to unauthorized parties\n•\nIntegrity — ensuring data is not changed accidentally or without authorization and is accurate\n26      www.allstate.com\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\n2021 Form 10-K\n•\nAvailability — ensuring our data and systems are accessible to meet our business needs\nWe collect, use, store or transmit a large amount of confidential, proprietary and other information (including personal information of customers, claimants or employees) in connection with the operation of our business. Systems are subject to increased cyberattacks and unauthorized access, such as physical and electronic break-ins or unauthorized tampering.\nWe constantly defend against threats to our data and systems, including malware and computer virus attacks, unauthorized access, system failures and disruptions. We have experienced breaches of our data and systems, although to date none of these breaches has had a material effect on our business, operations or reputation. Events like these jeopardize the information processed and stored in, and transmitted through, our computer systems and networks and otherwise cause interruptions or malfunctions in our operations, which could result in damage to our reputation, financial losses, litigation, increased costs, regulatory penalties or customer dissatisfaction.\nThese risks may increase in the future as threats become more sophisticated and we continue to expand internet and mobile strategies, develop additional remote connectivity solutions to serve our employees and customers, develop and expand products and services designed to protect customers’ digital footprint, and build and maintain an integrated digital enterprise.\nOur increased use of third-party services (e.g., cloud technology and software as a service) can make it more difficult to identify and respond to cyberattacks in any of the above situations. Although we may review and assess third-party vendor cyber security controls, our efforts may not be successful in preventing or mitigating the effects of such events. Third parties to whom we outsource certain functions are also subject to cybersecurity risks.\nPersonal information is subject to an increasing number of federal, state, local and international laws and regulations regarding privacy and data security, as well as contractual commitments. Any failure or perceived failure by us to comply with such obligations may result in governmental enforcement actions and fines, litigation or public statements against us by consumer advocacy groups or others and could cause our employees and customers to lose trust in us, which could have an adverse effect on our reputation and business.\nSee the Regulation section, Privacy Regulation and Data Security, for additional information.\nThe occurrence of a disaster, such as a natural catastrophe, pandemic, industrial accident, blackout, terrorist attack, war, cyberattack, computer virus, insider threat, unanticipated problems with our disaster recovery processes, or a support failure from external providers, could have an adverse effect on our ability to conduct business and on our results of operations and financial condition, particularly if those\nevents affect our computer-based data processing, transmission, storage, and retrieval systems or destroy data. If a significant number of employees were unavailable in the event of a disaster, our ability to effectively conduct business could be severely compromised. Our systems are also subject to compromise from internal threats.\nLosses from changing climate and weather conditions may adversely affect our financial condition, profitability or cash flows\nClimate change affects the occurrence of certain natural events, such as increasing the frequency or severity of wind, tornado, hailstorm and thunderstorm events due to increased convection in the atmosphere. There could also be more frequent wildfires in certain geographies, more flooding and the potential for increased severity of hurricanes due to higher sea surface temperatures. As a result, incurred losses from such events and the demand, price and availability of reinsurance coverages for automobile and homeowners insurance may be affected.\nClimate change may also impact insurability by impairing our ability to identify and quantify potential hazards that will result in losses and offer our customers products at an affordable price. Our investment portfolio is also subject to the effects of climate change as economic shifts alter the return dynamic of long-term investments and reduce valuations.\nDue to significant variability associated with future changing climate conditions, we are unable to predict the impact climate change will have on our businesses.\nWe are subject to extensive regulation, and potential further restrictive regulation may increase operating costs and limit growth\nMany of our affiliates operate in the highly regulated insurance and broader financial services sector and are subject to extensive laws and regulations that are complex and subject to change. Changes may lead to additional expenses, increased legal exposure, or increased reserve or capital requirements limiting our ability to grow or to achieve targeted profitability. Moreover, laws and regulations are administered and enforced by governmental authorities that exercise interpretive latitude, including:\n•\nState insurance regulators\n•\nState securities administrators\n•\nState attorneys general\n•\nFederal agencies including the SEC, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the Department of Labor, the U.S. Department of Justice and the National Labor Relations Board\nConsequently, compliance with one regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation of a legal issue may not result in compliance with another’s interpretation of the same issue.\nThere is risk that one regulator’s or enforcement authority’s interpretation of a legal issue may change\nThe Allstate Corporation      27\n2021 Form 10-K\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\nto our detriment. There is also a risk that changes in the overall legal environment may cause us to change our views regarding the actions we need to take from a legal risk management perspective. This could necessitate changes to our practices that may adversely impact our business. In some cases, state insurance laws and regulations are generally intended to protect or benefit purchasers or users of insurance products, not holders of securities that we issue. These laws and regulations may limit our ability to grow or to improve the profitability of our business.\nIn addition, increasing governmental and societal attention to environmental, social, and governance matters, including expanding mandatory and voluntary reporting, diligence, and disclosure on topics such as climate change, human capital, labor, and risk oversight, could expand the nature, scope, and complexity of matters that we are required to control, assess, and report.\nA regulatory environment that requires rate increases to be approved, can dictate underwriting practices and mandate participation in loss sharing arrangements may adversely affect results of operations and financial condition\nPolitical events and positions can affect the insurance market, including efforts to suppress rates to a level that may not allow us to reach targeted levels of profitability. Regulatory challenges to rate increases may restrict rate changes that may be required to achieve targeted levels of profitability and returns on equity. If we are unsuccessful, our results of operations could be negatively impacted.\nIn addition, certain states have enacted laws that require an insurer conducting business in that state to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations. Certain states also require the insurer to offer coverage to all consumers, often restricting an insurer’s ability to charge the price it might otherwise charge for the risk acceptance. In these markets, we may be compelled to underwrite significant amounts of business at lower-than-desired rates, possibly leading to an unacceptable return on equity. Alternatively, as the facilities recognize a financial deficit, they could have the ability to assess participating insurers, adversely affecting our results of operations and financial condition. Laws and regulations of many states also limit an insurer’s ability to withdraw from one or more lines of insurance, except pursuant to a plan that is approved by the state insurance department. Certain states require an insurer to participate in guaranty funds for impaired or insolvent insurance companies. These funds periodically assess losses against all insurance companies doing business in the state. Our results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected by any of these factors.\nRegulatory reforms, and the more stringent application of existing regulations, may make it more expensive for us to conduct our business\nThe federal government has enacted comprehensive regulatory reforms for financial services entities. As part of a larger effort to strengthen the\nregulation of the financial services market, certain reforms are applicable to the insurance industry.\nThe Federal Insurance Office (“FIO”) and Financial Stability Oversight Council have been established, and the federal government may enact reforms that affect the state insurance regulatory framework. The potential impact of state or federal measures that change the nature or scope of insurance and financial regulation is uncertain but may make it more expensive for us to conduct business and limit our ability to grow or achieve profitability.\nWe have business process and information technology operations in Canada, India and the United Kingdom that are subject to operating, regulatory and political risks in those countries. We may incur substantial costs and other negative consequences if any of these occur, including an adverse effect on our business, results of operations and financial condition.\nLosses from legal and regulatory actions may be material to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition\nWe are involved in various legal actions, including class-action litigation challenging a range of company practices and coverage provided by our insurance products, some of which involve claims for substantial or indeterminate amounts. We are also involved in various regulatory actions and inquiries, including market conduct exams by state insurance regulatory agencies. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in any of these matters, the ultimate liability may be more than amounts currently accrued or disclosed in our reasonably possible loss range and may be material to our results of operations, cash flows and financial condition.\nSee Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in or the application of accounting standards issued by standard-setting bodies and changes in tax laws may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition\nOur financial statements are subject to the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America, which are periodically revised, interpreted or expanded. Accordingly, we may be required to adopt new guidance or interpretations, which may have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition and could adversely impact financial strength ratings.\n•\nMarket declines, changes in business strategies or other events impacting the fair value of goodwill or purchased intangible assets could result in an impairment charge to income\n•\nRealization of our deferred tax assets assumes that we can fully utilize the deductions recognized for tax purposes; we may recognize additional tax expense if these assets are not fully utilized\n•\nNew tax legislative initiatives may be enacted that may impact our effective tax rate and could adversely affect our tax positions or tax liabilities\n28      www.allstate.com\nPart I - Item 1A. Risk Factors and Other Disclosures\n2021 Form 10-K\nSee MD&A, Application of Critical Accounting Estimates and Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for further details.\nLoss of key vendor relationships or failure of a vendor to protect our data, confidential and proprietary information, or personal information of our customers, claimants or employees could adversely affect our operations\nWe rely on services and products provided by many vendors in the U.S. and abroad. These include vendors of computer hardware, software, cloud technology and software as a service, as well as vendors or outsourcing of services such as:\n•\nClaim adjustment services\n•\nCall center services for customer support\n•\nHuman resource benefits management\n•\nInformation technology support\n•\nInvestment management services\nIf any vendor becomes unable to continue to provide products or services, or fails to protect our confidential, proprietary, and other information, we may suffer operational impairments and financial losses.\nOur ability to attract, develop, and retain talent to maintain appropriate staffing levels and establish a successful work culture is critical to our success\nCompetition from within the insurance industry and from other industries, including the technology sector, for qualified employees with highly specialized knowledge in areas such as underwriting, data and analytics, technology and e-commerce, has often been intense and we have experienced increased competition in hiring and retaining employees. The increased prevalence of remote-working arrangements that do not require employees to relocate to take a new job could contribute to higher turnover.\nFactors that affect our ability to attract and retain such employees include:\n•\nCompensation and benefits\n•\nTraining and re-skilling programs\n•\nReputation as a successful business with a culture of fair hiring, and of training and promoting qualified employees\n•\nRecognition of and response to changing trends and other circumstances that affect employees\nThe unexpected loss of key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of the loss of their skills, knowledge of our products and offerings and years of industry experience and, in some cases, the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel.\nMisconduct or fraudulent acts by employees, agents and third parties may expose us to financial loss, disruption of business, regulatory assessments and reputational harm\nThe company and the insurance industry are inherently susceptible to past and future misconduct\nor fraudulent activities by employees, representative agents, vendors, customers and other third parties. These activities could include:\n•\nFraud against the company, its employees and its customers through illegal or prohibited activities\n•\nUnauthorized acts or representations, unauthorized use or disclosure of personal or proprietary information, deception, and misappropriation of funds or other benefits"

It should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes found under Item 8. contained herein.\nA discussion of strategy, including updates to the multi-year Transformative Growth initiative, can be found in Part 1, Item 1. Business.\nThis section of this Form 10-K generally discusses 2021 and 2020 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2021 and 2020. Discussions of 2019 results and year-to-year comparisons between 2020 and 2019 that are not included in this Form 10-K can be found in Management’s Discussion and Analysis (“MD&A”) in Part II, Item 7 of our annual report on Form 10-K for 2020, filed February 19, 2021.\nThe most important factors we monitor to evaluate the financial condition and performance for our reportable segments and the Company include:\n•\nAllstate Protection\n: premium, policies in force (“PIF”), new business sales, policy retention, price changes, claim frequency and severity, catastrophes, loss ratio, expenses, underwriting results, and relative competitive position.\n•\nProtection Services\n: revenues, premium written, PIF and adjusted net income.\n•\nAllstate Health and Benefits\n: premiums, new business sales, PIF, benefit ratio, expenses and adjusted net income.\n•\nInvestments\n: exposure to market risk, asset allocation, credit quality/experience, total return, net investment income, cash flows, net gains and losses on investments and derivative instruments, unrealized capital gains and losses, long-term returns, and asset and liability duration.\n•\nFinancial condition\n: liquidity, parent holding company deployable assets, financial strength ratings, operating leverage, debt levels, book value per share and return on equity.\nMeasuring segment profit or loss\nThe measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments and adjusted net income for the Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Corporate and Other segments.\nUnderwriting income\nis calculated as premiums earned and other revenue, less claims and claims expense (“losses”), Shelter-in-Place Payback expense, amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles, and restructuring and related charges, as determined using accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). We use this measure in our evaluation of results of operations to analyze profitability.\nAdjusted net income\nis net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding:\nThe Allstate Corporation      33\n2021 Form 10-K\nAcquisitions and Dispositions\nAcquisitions\nOn January 4, 2021, we completed the acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. (“National General”), significantly enhancing our strategic position in the independent agency channel. The transaction increased our market share in personal property-liability by over one percentage point and enhanced our independent agent-facing technology.\nOn June 1, 2021, we announced an agreement to acquire Safe Auto Insurance Group, Inc. (“SafeAuto”), a non-standard auto insurance carrier. On October 1, 2021, we completed the acquisition for $262 million in cash.\nDiscontinued operations and held for sale\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, we announced the pending sales of Allstate Life Insurance Company (“ALIC”), Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York (“ALNY”) and certain affiliates. On October 1, 2021, we closed the sale of ALNY to Wilton Reassurance Company for $400 million. On November 1, 2021, we closed the sale of ALIC and certain affiliates to entities managed by Blackstone for total proceeds of $4 billion, including a pre-close dividend of $1.25 billion paid by ALIC.\nIn 2021, the loss on disposition was $4.09 billion, after-tax, and reflects purchase price adjustments associated with certain pre-close transactions specified in the stock purchase agreements, changes in statutory capital and surplus prior to the closing dates and the closing date equity of the sold entities determined under GAAP, excluding accumulated other comprehensive income (“AOCI”) derecognized related to the dispositions.\nBeginning in the first quarter of 2021, the assets and liabilities of the business were reclassified as held for sale and results are presented as discontinued operations. This change was applied on a retrospective basis.\nSee Note 3 of the consolidated financial statements for further information on acquisitions and dispositions.\nThe Novel Coronavirus Pandemic or COVID-19 (“Coronavirus”)\nThe Coronavirus resulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, government-imposed shelter-in-place orders, quarantine periods, social distancing, and restrictions on large gatherings. These measures moderated in 2021 as vaccines have become more widely available in the United States and Canada. There is no way of predicting with certainty how long the pandemic might last. We continue to closely monitor and proactively adapt to developments and changing conditions. Currently, it is not possible to reliably estimate the impact to our operations, but the effects have been and could be material.\nCertain growth and profitability comparisons to the prior year were impacted, in part, by the effects the Coronavirus had on our prior year results. Beginning in March 2020, when shelter-in-place orders and other restrictions were initiated, and throughout 2020, we experienced lower accident claim frequency and different claim patterns than historically experienced. Claim frequency increased in 2021, but remains below pre-pandemic levels.\nThe Coronavirus has affected our operations and may continue to significantly affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. The impact from the pandemic should be considered when comparing the current year to the prior year, including:\n•\nSales of new and retention of existing policies\n•\nPremium for transportation network products\n•\nDriving behavior and auto accident frequency\n•\nSupply chain disruptions and labor shortages impacts on the cost of settling claims\n•\nHospital and outpatient claim costs\n•\nInvestment valuations and returns\n•\nBad debt and credit allowance exposure\n•\nConsumer utilization of Milewise\n®\n,\nour pay-per-mile insurance product\n•\nRetail sales in Allstate Protection Plans\nA pandemic such as the Coronavirus and its impacts are disclosed in Part 1 “Item 1A. Risk Factors’’, including the risk factors titled “\nA large-scale pandemic, the occurrence of terrorism, military actions, social unrest or other actions may have an adverse effect on our business\n” and “\nConditions in the global economy and capital markets could adversely affect our business and results of operations\n”.\nThis list is not inclusive of all potential impacts and should not be treated as such. Within the MD&A we have included further disclosures related to the impacts of the Coronavirus on our 2021 results.\n34      www.allstate.com\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\n2022 operating priorities will remain consistent with the 2021 priorities.\nThe Allstate Corporation      35\n2021 Form 10-K\nSummarized financial results\nSegment Highlights\nAllstate Protection\nunderwriting income totaled $1.79 billion in 2021, a 60.9% decrease from $4.57 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher auto and homeowners non-catastrophe and catastrophe losses and increased underwriting expenses, partially offset by increased premiums earned in Allstate brand and lower Shelter-in-Place Payback expense.\nCatastrophe losses were $3.34 billion in 2021 compared $2.81 billion in 2020.\nPremiums written increased 15.6% to $41.36 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the acquisition of National General and higher Allstate brand homeowners premiums.\nProtection Services\nadjusted net income was $179 million in 2021 compared to $153 million in 2020. The improvement in 2021 was primarily due to growth of Allstate Protection Plans, lower claims costs at Allstate Dealer Services, growth and lower levels of investment at both Arity and Allstate Identity Protection, partially offset by higher severity and rescue volumes in Allstate Roadside.\nPremiums and other revenues increased 24.5% or $417 million to $2.12 billion in 2021 from $1.70 billion in 2020 primarily due to Allstate Protection Plan’s growth through its U.S. retail and international channels and the addition of LeadCloud and Transparent.ly, which were acquired as part of the National General acquisition.\nAllstate Health and Benefits\nadjusted net income was $208 million in 2021 compared to $96 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to the acquisition of National General’s group health and individual health business, which resulted in higher premiums and contract charges, partially offset by higher policy benefits and operating costs and expenses.\nPremiums and contract charges totaled $1.82 billion in 2021, an increase of 66.5% from $1.09 billion in 2020.\n36      www.allstate.com\n2021 Form 10-K\nFinancial Highlights\nInvestments\ntotaled $64.70 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing from $59.54 billion as of December 31, 2020.\nShareholders’ equity\nAs of December 31, 2021, shareholders’ equity was $25.18 billion.\nBook value per diluted common share\n(ratio of common shareholders’ equity to total common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares outstanding) was $81.52 as of December 31, 2021, a decrease of 10.9% from $91.50 as of December 31, 2020.\nReturn on average common shareholders’ equity\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, return on common shareholders’ equity was 5.8%, a decrease of 15.2 points from 21.0% for the twelve months ended December 31, 2020, primarily due to lower net income applicable to common shareholders.\nPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses\nWe recorded pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains of $644 million in 2021, primarily related to favorable asset performance compared to the expected return on plan assets and an increase in the liability discount rate. See Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A for further information.\nThe Allstate Corporation      37\n2021 Form 10-K\nProperty-Liability\nProperty-Liability Operations\nOverview\nProperty-Liability operations consist of two reportable segments: Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability. These segments are consistent with the groupings of financial information that management uses to evaluate performance and to determine the allocation of resources.\nWe do not allocate Property-Liability investment income, net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability level for decision-making purposes.\nGAAP operating ratios\nare used to measure our profitability to enhance an investor’s understanding of our financial results and are calculated as follows:\n•\nLoss ratio:\nthe ratio of claims and claims expense (loss adjustment expenses), to premiums earned. Loss ratios include the impact of catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates.\n•\nExpense ratio:\nthe ratio of amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles, restructuring and related charges and Shelter-in-Place Payback expense, less other revenue to premiums earned.\n•\nCombined ratio:\nthe sum of the loss ratio and the expense ratio.\nWe have also calculated the following impacts of specific items on the GAAP operating ratios because of the volatility of these items between periods. The impacts are calculated by taking the specific items noted below divided by Property-Liability premiums earned:\n•\nEffect of catastrophe losses on combined ratio:\nincludes catastrophe losses and prior year reserve reestimates of catastrophe losses included in claims and claims expense\n•\nEffect of prior year reserve reestimates on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of amortization of purchased intangibles on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of impairment of purchased intangibles on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of restructuring and related charges on combined ratio\n•\nEffect of Shelter-in-Place Payback expense on combined and expense ratios\n•\nEffect of Run-off Property-Liability business on combined ratio:\nincludes claims and claims expense, restructuring and related charges and operating costs and expenses in the Run-off Property-Liability segment\nPremium measures and statistics\nare used to analyze our premium trends and are calculated as follows:\n•\nPIF\n: Policy counts are based on items rather than customers. A multi-car customer would generate multiple item (policy) counts, even if all cars were insured under one policy.

Paid claim severity increased in 2021 compared to 2020 due to inflationary loss cost pressure driven by increases in labor and materials costs. Homeowner paid claim severity can be impacted by both the mix of perils and the magnitude of specific losses paid during the quarter.\nOther personal lines loss ratio\nincreased 4.2 points in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to higher non-catastrophe losses, partially offset by increased premiums earned.\nCommercial lines loss ratio\nincreased 15.1 points in 2021 compared to 2020 due to higher auto frequency and severity and higher unfavorable non-catastrophe prior year reserves reestimates, partially offset by increased premiums earned.\nCatastrophe losses\nincreased 18.8% or $528 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Catastrophe losses in 2021 included gross losses of $2.4 billion and net losses of $1.3 billion related to Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri. Net losses include reinsurance recoveries of $1.3 billion and reinstatement premiums of $208 million.\nWe define a “catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, tsunamis, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as certain types of terrorism, wildfires or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.\n44      www.allstate.com\nAllstate Protection\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nIncludes approximately $250 million of reinstatement premiums for the year ended December 31, 2021, related to the Nationwide Catastrophe Reinsurance Program, primarily due to Hurricane Ida.\nCatastrophe management\nHistorical catastrophe experience\nFor the last ten years, the average annual impact of catastrophes on our loss ratio was 7.7 points, but it has varied from 4.5 points to 10.3 points. The average annual impact of catastrophes on the homeowners loss ratio for the last ten years was 24.6 points. Over time, we have limited our aggregate insurance exposure to catastrophe losses in certain regions of the country that are subject to high levels of natural catastrophes by our participation in various state facilities. For further discussion of these facilities, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. However, the impact of these actions may be diminished by the growth in insured values, and the effect of state insurance laws and regulations. In addition, in various states we are required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers. Because of our participation in these and other state facilities such as wind pools, we may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities and to assessments from these facilities.\nWe have continued to take actions to maintain an appropriate level of exposure to catastrophic events while continuing to meet the needs of our customers, including the following:\n•\nContinuing to limit or not offer new homeowners, manufactured home and landlord package policy business in certain coastal geographies.\n•\nIncreased capacity in our brokerage platform for customers not offered an Allstate policy.\n•\nWe began to write a limited number of homeowners policies in select areas of California in 2016, additionally we:\n–\nContinue to renew current policyholders and allow replacement policies for existing customers who buy a new home or change their residence to rental property\n–\nHave decreased our overall homeowner exposures in California by more than 50% since 2007\n–\nWrite homeowners coverage through our excess and surplus lines carrier, North Light Specialty Insurance Company (“North Light”), which includes earthquake coverage (other than fire following earthquakes) that is currently ceded via quota share reinsurance.\n•\nIn certain states, we have been ceding wind exposure related to insured property located in wind pool eligible areas.\n•\nStarting in the second quarter of 2017, we began writing a limited number of homeowners policies in select areas of Florida and continue to support existing customers who replace their currently-insured home with an acceptable property. Encompass withdrew from property lines in Florida in 2009.\n•\nTropical cyclone deductibles are generally higher than all peril deductibles and are in place for a large portion of coastal insured properties.\n•\nAuto comprehensive damage coverage generally includes coverage for flood-related loss. We have additional catastrophe exposure, beyond the property lines, for auto customers who have purchased comprehensive damage coverage.\n•\nWe offer a homeowners policy available in 43 states, Allstate House and Home\n®\n, that provides options of coverage for roof damage, including graduated coverage and pricing based on roof type and age. In 2021, premiums written totaled $4.56 billion or 46.0% of homeowners premiums written compared to $3.92 billion or 46.7% in 2020.\nHurricanes\nWe consider the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses due to hurricanes generally to be major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States. The average premium on a property policy near these coasts is generally greater than in other areas. However, average premiums are often not considered commensurate with the inherent risk of loss. In addition, as explained in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements, in various states Allstate is subject to assessments from assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting\nThe Allstate Corporation      45\n2021 Form 10-K\nAllstate Protection\nassociations providing insurance for wind related property losses.\nWe have addressed our risk of hurricane loss by, among other actions, purchasing reinsurance for specific states and on a countrywide basis for our personal lines property insurance in areas most exposed to hurricanes, limiting personal homeowners, landlord package policy and manufactured home new business writings in coastal areas in southern and eastern states, implementing tropical cyclone deductibles where appropriate, and not offering continuing coverage on certain policies in coastal counties in certain states. We continue to seek appropriate returns for the risks we write. This may require further actions, similar to those already taken, in geographies where we are not getting appropriate returns. However, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where adequate risk adjusted returns can be achieved.\nEarthquakes\nWe do not offer earthquake coverage in most states. We retain approximately 40,000 PIF with earthquake coverage, with the largest number of policies located in Kentucky, due to regulatory and other reasons. We purchase reinsurance in Kentucky and enter into arrangements in many states to make earthquake coverage available through our brokerage platform.\nWe continue to have exposure to earthquake risk on certain policies that do not specifically exclude coverage for earthquake losses, including our auto policies, and to fires following earthquakes. Allstate homeowner policyholders in California are offered coverage for damage caused by an earthquake through the California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”), a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Allstate is subject to assessments from the CEA under certain circumstances as explained in Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements. While North Light writes property policies in California, which can include earthquake coverage, this coverage is 100% ceded via quota share reinsurance.\nFires following earthquakes\nUnder a standard homeowners policy we cover fire losses, including those caused by an earthquake. Actions taken related to our risk of loss from fires following earthquakes include restrictive underwriting guidelines in California for new business writings, purchasing reinsurance for Kentucky personal lines property risks, and purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, excluding Florida.\nWildfires\nActions taken related to managing our risk of loss from wildfires include purchasing nationwide occurrence reinsurance, new and renewal inspection programs to identify and remediate wildfire risk as well as leveraging contemporary underwriting tools in select areas. While these programs are designed to mitigate risk, the exposure to wildfires still exists. We continue to manage our\nexposure and seek appropriate returns for the risks we write.\nTo manage the exposure, we may implement further actions, similar to those already taken, in geographies where we are not achieving appropriate returns. However, we may maintain or opportunistically increase our presence in areas where adequate risk adjusted returns can be achieved.\nReinsurance\nThe total cost of our property catastrophe reinsurance programs, excluding reinstatement premiums, during 2021 was $556 million compared to $425 million during 2020. Catastrophe placement premiums are a reduction of premium with approximately 74% related to homeowners. The increases were driven by higher Nationwide and Florida program costs due to program expansion for growth in policies, including National General exposures. In the third quarter of 2021, our catastrophe reinsurance program risk tolerance framework that targets less than a 1% likelihood of annual aggregate catastrophe losses from hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, excluding other catastrophe losses, net of reinsurance, increased from $2 billion to $2.5 billion, reflecting the addition of wildfires to the target. A description of our current catastrophe reinsurance program appears in Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.\n46      www.allstate.com\nAllstate Protection\n2021 Form 10-K\nExpense ratio\ndecreased 2.3 points in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily related to lower Shelter-in-Place Payback expense, operating costs and expenses, restructuring and related charges, partially offset by increased advertising and amortization of purchased intangibles and DAC related to the acquisition of National General.\nDeferred acquisition costs\nWe establish a DAC asset for costs that are related directly to the acquisition of new or renewal insurance policies, principally agent remuneration and premium taxes. DAC is amortized to income over the period in which premiums are earned.\nThe Allstate Corporation      47\n2021 Form 10-K\nRun-off Property-Liability\nRun-off Property-Liability Segment\nThe Run-off Property-Liability segment includes results from property and casualty insurance coverage that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other run-off lines claims arises principally from direct excess commercial insurance, assumed reinsurance coverage, direct primary commercial insurance and other businesses in run-off. For additional information on our strategy and outlook, see Part I, Item 1. Business - Strategy and Segment Information.\nUnderwriting losses\nin 2021 and 2020 primarily related to our annual reserve review using established industry and actuarial best practices. The annual review resulted in unfavorable reserve reestimates totaling $111 million and $132 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The reserve reestimates are included as part of claims and claims expense.\nReserve reestimates in 2021 primarily related to new reported information for asbestos and environmental and higher than expected reported losses for environmental and other run-off exposures. Reserve reestimates in 2020 primarily related to new reported information, court decisions and policy buyback settlements for asbestos exposures and higher than expected reported losses for environmental and other run-off exposures.\nWe believe that our reserves are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (e.g., claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. However, as we progress with the resolution of disputed claims in the courts and arbitrations and with negotiations and settlements, our reported losses may be more variable.\n48      www.allstate.com\nRun-off Property-Liability\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nApproximately 70% of gross case reserves as of December 31, 2021 are subject to settlement agreements.\n(2)\nApproximately 77% of ceded case reserves as of December 31, 2021 are subject to settlement agreements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      49\n2021 Form 10-K\nRun-off Property-Liability\n(1)\nIn 2021 70% of payments related to settlement agreements.\n(2)\nIn 2021 72% of payments related to settlement agreements.\nTotal net reserves as of December 31, 2021, included $733 million or 52% of estimated IBNR reserves compared to $695 million or 49% of estimated IBNR reserves as of December 31, 2020.\nTotal gross payments were $142 million and $137 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively, primarily related to settlement agreements reached with several insureds on large claims, mainly asbestos, where the scope of coverages has been agreed upon. The claims associated with these settlement agreements are expected to be substantially paid out\nover the next several years as qualified claims are submitted by these insureds.\nReinsurance collections were $39 million and $53 million for 2021 and 2020, respectively. The allowance for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables was $66 million and $59 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The allowance represents 11.0% and 10.5% of the related reinsurance recoverable balances as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n50      www.allstate.com\nProtection Services\n2021 Form 10-K\nProtection Services Segment\nProtection Services comprise Allstate Protection Plans, Allstate Dealer Services, Allstate Roadside, Arity and Allstate Identity Protection. Protection Services include National General’s LeadCloud and Transparent.ly’s results within Arity starting in the first quarter of 2021. These businesses provide marketing and integration platforms connecting data buyers and sellers. Results prior to 2021 reflect historical Arity results only.\nIn 2021, Protection Services represented 77.7% of total PIF, 6.0% of premiums written and 4.4% of total adjusted net income. We offer consumer product protection plans, finance and insurance products (including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection waivers, road hazard tire and wheel and paintless dent repair protection), roadside assistance, device and mobile data collection services and analytic solutions using automotive telematics information and identity protection.

For a description of our reserve process, see Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. Further, for a description of our reserving policies and the potential variability in our reserve estimates, see the Application of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR claims, as of the reporting date.\nThe facts and circumstances leading to reestimates of reserves relate to changes in claim activity and revisions to the development factors used to predict how losses are likely to develop from the end of a reporting period until all claims have been paid. Reestimates occur when actual losses differ from those predicted by the estimated development factors used in prior reserve estimates.\nWe believe the net loss reserves exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws and regulations.\nThe year-end 2021 gross reserves of $33.06 billion for insurance claims and claims expense were $11.15 billion more than the net reserve balance of $21.91 billion recorded on the basis of statutory accounting practices for reports provided to state regulatory authorities. The principal differences are recoverables from third parties totaling $9.48 billion, including $6.64 billion of indemnification recoverables related to the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”), that reduce reserves for statutory reporting, but are recorded as assets for GAAP reporting, and a liability for the reserves of the Canadian subsidiaries for $1.55 billion that are a component of our consolidated reserves, but not included in our U.S. statutory reserves.\n(1)\nFavorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\n(2)\nRatios are calculated using property and casualty premiums earned.\nThe Allstate Corporation      53\n2021 Form 10-K\nClaims and Claims Expense Reserves\nThe following tables reflect the accident years to which the reestimates shown above are applicable. Favorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\nAllstate Protection\nThe tables below show Allstate Protection net reserves representing the estimated cost of outstanding claims as they were recorded at the beginning of years 2021, 2020, and 2019, and the effect of reestimates in each year.\nFavorable results for homeowners lines in\n2021 were primarily due to catastrophe reserve reestimates driven by estimated recoveries related to our aggregate reinsurance coverage and wildfire subrogation settlements. Unfavorable reserve reestimates for auto and commercial lines in 2021 primarily related to auto liability coverages.\nFavorable results for homeowners lines in\n2020 were primarily due to catastrophe reserve reestimates\ndriven by wildfire subrogation settlements. Favorable reserve reestimates for auto in 2020 primarily related to favorable non-catastrophe reserve reestimates in personal lines auto, partially offset by strengthening in commercial lines auto reserves.\nEstimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables.\n54      www.allstate.com\nClaims and Claims Expense Reserves\n2021 Form 10-K\nRun-off Property-Liability\nWe conduct an annual review in the third quarter of each year to evaluate and establish asbestos, environmental and other run-off reserves. Reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (e.g. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by policyholders.\nReserve reestimates in 2021 primarily related to new reported information for asbestos and environmental and higher than expected reported losses for environmental and other run-off exposures.\nReserve reestimates in 2020 primarily related to new reported information, court decisions and policy buyback settlements for asbestos exposures and higher than expected reported losses for environmental and other run-off exposures.\nThe survival ratio is calculated by taking our ending reserves divided by payments made during the year. This is a commonly used but simplistic and imprecise approach to measuring the adequacy of asbestos and environmental reserve levels. Many factors, such as mix of business, level of coverage provided and settlement procedures have significant impacts on the amount of environmental and asbestos claims and claims expense reserves, claim payments and the resultant ratio. As payments result in corresponding reserve reductions, survival ratios can be expected to vary over time. The asbestos and environmental net 3-year survival ratio in 2021 was comparable to 2020.\nThe Allstate Corporation      55\n2021 Form 10-K\nClaims and Claims Expense Reserves\nIBNR net reserves increased $37 million as of December 31, 2021 compared to December 31, 2020. IBNR provides for reserve development of known claims and future reporting of additional unknown claims from current policyholders and ceding companies.\nReinsurance and indemnification programs\nWe utilize reinsurance to reduce exposure to catastrophe risk and manage capital, and to support the required statutory surplus and the insurance financial strength ratings of certain subsidiaries such as Castle Key Insurance Company (“CKIC”) and Allstate New Jersey Insurance Company (“ANJ”). We purchase significant reinsurance to manage our aggregate countrywide exposure to an acceptable level. The price and terms of reinsurance and the credit quality of the reinsurer are considered in the purchase process. We have also purchased reinsurance to mitigate exposures in our long-tail liability lines, including environmental, asbestos and other run-off lines as well as our commercial lines, including shared economy. We also participate in various indemnification mechanisms, including state-based industry pool or facility programs mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state and the federal government National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). See Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements for additional details on these programs.\n56      www.allstate.com\nClaims and Claims Expense Reserves\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nN/A reflects no S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”) rating available.\n(2)\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, MCCA includes $51 million and $34 million of reinsurance recoverable on paid claims, respectively, and $6.64 billion and $5.61 billion of reinsurance recoverable on unpaid claims, respectively.\n(3)\nOther reinsurance recoverables primarily relate to commercial lines, including shared economy, as well as asbestos, environmental and other liability exposures.\n(4)\nA.M. Best ratings for Lloyd’s and Westport Insurance Corporation are A and A+, respectively.\nReinsurance and indemnification recoverables include an estimate of the amount of insurance claims and claims expense reserves that are ceded under the terms of the agreements, including IBNR unpaid losses. We calculate our ceded reinsurance and indemnification estimates based on the terms of each applicable agreement, including an estimate of how IBNR losses will ultimately be ceded under the agreement. We also consider other limitations and coverage exclusions under our agreements. Accordingly, our estimate of recoverables is subject to similar risks and uncertainties as our estimate of reserves claims and claims expense. We believe the recoverables are appropriately established; however, as our underlying reserves continue to develop, the amount ultimately recoverable may vary from amounts currently recorded. We regularly evaluate the reinsurers and the respective amounts of our reinsurance recoverables, and a provision for uncollectible reinsurance recoverables is recorded, if needed. The establishment of reinsurance recoverables and the related allowance for\nuncollectible reinsurance is also an inherently uncertain process involving estimates. Changes in estimates could result in additional changes to the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nIndemnification recoverables are considered collectible based on the industry pool and facility enabling legislation and the Company has not had any credit losses related to these programs and we do not anticipate losses in the foreseeable future. We also have not experienced credit losses on our catastrophe reinsurance programs, which include highly rated reinsurers.\nThe allowance for uncollectible reinsurance relates to other reinsurance programs primarily related to our Run-off Property-Liability segment. This allowance was $66 million and $59 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe allowance is based upon our ongoing review of amounts outstanding, length of collection periods, changes in reinsurer credit standing, and other\nThe Allstate Corporation      57\n2021 Form 10-K\nClaims and Claims Expense Reserves\nrelevant factors. In addition, in the ordinary course of business, we may become involved in coverage disputes with certain of our reinsurers that may ultimately result in lawsuits and arbitrations brought by or against such reinsurers to determine the parties’ rights and obligations under the various reinsurance agreements. We employ dedicated specialists to manage reinsurance collections and disputes. We also consider recent developments in commutation activity between reinsurers and cedents, and recent trends in arbitration and litigation outcomes in disputes between cedents and reinsurers in seeking to maximize our reinsurance recoveries.\nAdverse developments in the insurance industry have led to a decline in the financial strength of some of our reinsurance carriers, causing amounts\nrecoverable from them and future claims ceded to them to be considered a higher risk. There has also been consolidation activity in the industry, which causes reinsurance risk across the industry to be concentrated among fewer companies.\nSee Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements for a description of the methodology utilized to calculate the allowance for reinsurance recoverables.\nFor further details related to our reinsurance and indemnification recoverables, see the Regulation section in Part I and Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.\n(1)\nDecline reflects reestimates in claims and claims expense related subrogation settlements.\n(2)\nDecline reflects reestimates in claims and claims expense related to the 2018 Camp Fire.\nIn 2021, ceded premiums earned increased primarily due to the addition of National General into our program and increased catastrophe reinsurance premium rates. In 2020, ceded premiums earned increased primarily due to increased catastrophe reinsurance premium rates. In 2021, ceded claims and\nclaims expenses increased $2.95 billion primarily due to Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri. In 2020, ceded claims and claims expenses decreased $6 million.

Gross reserves for the year ended December 31, 2020, comprise 82% case reserves and 18% IBNR. Gross reserves for the year ended December 31, 2019, comprise 85% case reserves and 15% IBNR. The MCCA does not require member companies to report ultimate case reserves.\nPending MCCA claims differ from most personal lines insurance pending claims as other personal lines policies have coverage limits and incurred claims settle in shorter periods. Claims are considered pending as long as payments are continuing pursuant to an outstanding MCCA claim, which can be for a claimant’s lifetime. Many of these injuries are catastrophic in nature, resulting in serious permanent disabilities that require attendant and residential care for periods that may span decades. A significant portion of the ultimate incurred claim reserves and the recoverables can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims that occurred more than five years ago and continue to pay lifetime benefits.\n(1)\nTotal claims includes those covered and not covered by the MCCA indemnification.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately 1,570 of our pending claims have been reported to the MCCA, of which approximately 70% represents claims that occurred more than 5 years ago. There are 59 Allstate brand claims with reserves in excess of $15 million as of December 31, 2021, which comprise approximately 21% of the gross ending reserves in the table above. As a result, significant developments with a single claimant can result in volatility in prior year incurred claims.\nIntercompany reinsurance\nWe enter into certain intercompany insurance and reinsurance transactions in order to maintain underwriting control and manage insurance risk among various legal entities. These reinsurance agreements have been approved by the appropriate regulatory authorities. All significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nCatastrophe reinsurance\nOur catastrophe reinsurance program is designed to address our exposure to catastrophes nationwide, utilizing our risk management methodology. Our program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, tornadoes, earthquakes, wildfires, and fires following earthquakes. These reinsurance agreements are part of our catastrophe management strategy, which is intended to provide our shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in our property business, while providing protection to our customers.\nWe anticipate completing the placement of our 2022 nationwide catastrophe reinsurance program in the second quarter of 2022.

Allstate Health and Benefits results include National General’s accident and health business, starting in the first quarter of 2021. Results prior to 2021 reflect historical Allstate Benefits results only.\nIn 2021, Allstate Health and Benefits represented 2.3% of total PIF and 5.2% of total adjusted net income.

Investment portfolios are held for Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other operations. While taking into consideration the investment portfolio in aggregate, management of the underlying portfolios is significantly influenced by the nature of each respective business and its corresponding liability profile. For each business, we identify a strategic asset allocation which considers both the nature of the liabilities and the risk and return characteristics of the various asset classes in which we invest. This allocation is informed by our long-term business and market expectations, as well as other considerations such as risk appetite, portfolio diversification, duration, desired liquidity and capital. Within appropriate ranges relative to strategic allocations, tactical allocations are made in consideration of prevailing and potential future market conditions. We manage risks that involve uncertainty related to interest rates, credit spreads, equity returns and currency exchange rates.\nThe Property-Liability portfolio emphasizes protection of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. This approach has produced competitive returns over the long term and is designed to ensure financial strength and stability for paying claims, while maximizing economic value and surplus growth. Products with lower liquidity needs, such as auto insurance and run-off lines, and capital create capacity to invest in less liquid higher yielding fixed income securities, performance-based investments such as limited partnerships and equity securities. Products with higher liquidity needs, such as homeowners insurance, are invested primarily in high quality liquid fixed income securities.\nThe Protection Services portfolio is focused on protection of principal and consistent income generation, within a total return framework. The portfolio is largely comprised of fixed income securities with a lesser allocation to equity securities and short-term investments.\nThe Allstate Health and Benefits portfolio is focused on protection of principal and consistent income generation while targeting an appropriate return on capital. The portfolio is largely comprised of fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans with a small allocation to equity securities.\nThe Corporate and Other portfolio balances liquidity needs related to the corporate capital structure with the pursuit of returns.\nWe utilize two primary strategies to manage risks and returns and to position our portfolio to take advantage of market opportunities while attempting to mitigate adverse effects. As strategies and market conditions evolve, the asset allocation may change.\nMarket-based\nstrategy seeks to deliver predictable earnings aligned to business needs and take advantage of short-term opportunities primarily through public and private fixed income investments and public equity securities.\nPerformance-based\nstrategy seeks to deliver attractive risk-adjusted returns and supplement market risk with idiosyncratic risk. Returns are impacted by a variety of factors including general macroeconomic and public market conditions as public benchmarks are often used in the valuation of underlying investments. Variability in earnings will also result from the performance of the underlying assets or business and the timing of sales of those investments. Earnings from the sales of investments may be recorded as net investment income or net gains and losses on investments and derivatives. The portfolio, which primarily includes private equity and real estate with a majority being limited partnerships, is diversified across a number of characteristics, including managers or partners, vintage years, strategies, geographies (including international) and industry sectors or property types. These investments are generally illiquid in nature, often require specialized expertise, typically involve a third-party manager, and often enhance returns and income through transformation at the company or property level. A portion of these investments seek returns in markets or asset classes that are dislocated or special situations, primarily in private markets.\nThe Allstate Corporation      63\n2021 Form 10-K\nInvestments\nCoronavirus impacts\nFuture investment results will be influenced by the magnitude and duration of the global pandemic and the impact of actions taken by governmental authorities, businesses and consumers, including the availability, utilization rate and effectiveness of vaccines, to mitigate health risks, which creates significant uncertainty. Supply chain disruptions and labor shortages have increased inflation, which may have an adverse impact on investment valuations and returns.\nInvestments Outlook\nWe plan to focus on the following priorities:\n•\nEnhance investment portfolio returns through use of a dynamic capital allocation framework and focus on tax efficiency.\n•\nLeverage our broad capabilities to manage the portfolio to earn higher risk-adjusted returns on capital.\n•\nInvest for the specific needs and characteristics of Allstate’s businesses, including its corresponding liability profile.\nWe expect to maintain performance-based investments in our Property-Liability portfolio, consistent with our strategy to have a greater proportion of return derived from idiosyncratic asset or operating performance. Income related to performance-based investments will result in variability of earnings for the Property-Liability portfolio.\nTo reduce exposure to an increasing interest rate environment, we shortened the duration of the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio by selling longer duration corporate and municipal bonds and reinvesting in shorter duration fixed income and public equity securities, as well as through the use of derivatives. These actions to shorten duration, coupled with continued reinvestment at market yields below the current market-based portfolio yield, will result in lower net investment income in future periods, but will reduce the adverse portfolio valuation impact of rising interest rates.\n(1)\nBalances reflect the elimination of related party investments between segments.\n(2)\nFixed income securities are carried at fair value. Amortized cost, net for these securities was $35.74 billion, $1.54 billion, $1.76 billion, $2.34 billion and $41.38 billion for Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, Corporate and Other, and in total, respectively.\n(3)\nEquity securities are carried at fair value. The fair value of equity securities, held as of December 31, 2021, was $1.05 billion in excess of cost. These net gains were primarily concentrated in the technology, consumer goods, and banking sectors. Equity securities include $1.13 billion of funds with underlying investments in fixed income securities as of December 31, 2021.\n(4)\nShort-term investments are carried at fair value.\nInvestments totaled $64.70 billion as of December 31, 2021, increasing from $59.54 billion as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to positive operating cash flows, proceeds from the sales of ALIC, ALNY and certain affiliates and National General acquisition, partially\noffset by lower fixed income valuations, common share repurchases and dividends paid to shareholders.\n64      www.allstate.com\nInvestments\n2021 Form 10-K\nDuring 2021, strategic actions focused on optimizing portfolio yield, return and risk in the more volatile and rising interest rate environment. We continued to increase performance-based investments in the Property-Liability portfolio including the addition of retained private equity and real estate investments from the sale of ALIC, ALNY and certain affiliates. We shortened the maturity profile of fixed income securities in our Property-Liability portfolio to 4.3 years to reduce exposure to an increasing interest rate environment.\nFixed income securities\nFixed income securities are rated by third-party credit rating agencies or are internally rated. As of December 31, 2021, 82.2% of the consolidated fixed income securities portfolio was rated investment grade, which is defined as a security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody’s, a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P, a comparable rating from another nationally recognized rating agency, or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. Credit ratings below these designations are considered lower credit quality or below investment grade, which includes high yield bonds. Market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating. Our initial investment decisions and ongoing\nmonitoring procedures for fixed income securities are based on a due diligence process which includes, but is not limited to, an assessment of the credit quality, sector, structure and liquidity risks of each issuer.\nFixed income portfolio monitoring is a\ncomprehensive process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance. The process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost is below internally established thresholds. For further detail on our fixed income portfolio monitoring process, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      65\n2021 Form 10-K\nInvestments\nMunicipal bonds\n, including tax exempt and taxable securities, include general obligations of state and local issuers and revenue bonds.\nOur practice for acquiring and monitoring municipal bonds is predominantly based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor. We currently rely on the primary obligor to pay all contractual cash flows and are not relying on bond insurers for payments. As a result of downgrades in the insurers’ credit ratings, the ratings of the insured municipal bonds generally reflect the underlying ratings of the primary obligor.\nCorporate bonds\ninclude publicly traded and privately placed securities. Privately placed securities primarily consist of corporate issued senior debt securities that are negotiated with the borrower or are issued by public entities in unregistered form.\nOur $10.7 billion portfolio of privately placed securities is diversified by issuer, industry sector and country. The portfolio is made up of 553 issuers. Privately placed corporate obligations may contain structural security features such as financial covenants and call protections that provide investors greater protection against credit deterioration, reinvestment risk or fluctuations in interest rates than those typically found in publicly registered debt securities. Additionally, investments in these securities are made after fundamental analysis of issuers and sectors along with macro and asset class views. Ongoing monitoring includes continuous assessment of operating performance and financial position. Every issue not rated by an independent rating agency is internally rated with a formal rating affirmation at least once a\nyear. Liquidity of securities issued by public entities in unregistered form is similar to public debt markets.\nOur corporate bonds portfolio includes $7.42 billion of below investment grade bonds, $5.49 billion of which are privately placed. These securities are diversified by issuer and industry sector. The below investment grade corporate bonds portfolio is made up of 416 issuers. We employ fundamental analyses of issuers and sectors along with macro and asset class views to identify investment opportunities. This results in a portfolio with broad exposure to the high yield market with an emphasis on idiosyncratic positions reflective of our views of market conditions and opportunities.\nForeign government securities\nconsist of Canadian governmental and provincial securities (all of which are held by our Canadian companies).\nABS\nare structured securities that are primarily collateralized by consumer or corporate borrowings and residential and commercial real estate loans. The cash flows from the underlying collateral paid to the securitization trust are generally applied in a pre-determined order and are designed so that each security issued by the trust, typically referred to as a “class”, qualifies for a specific original rating.\nABS includes collateralized debt obligations, consumer and other ABS. Credit risk is managed by monitoring the performance of the underlying collateral. Many of the securities in the ABS portfolio have credit enhancement with features such as overcollateralization, subordinated structures, reserve funds, guarantees or insurance. ABS also includes\n66      www.allstate.com\nInvestments\n2021 Form 10-K\nresidential mortgage-backed securities and commercial mortgage-backed securities.\nFor example, the “senior” portion or “top” of the capital structure, or rating class, which would originally qualify for a rating of Aaa typically has priority in receiving principal repayments on the underlying collateral and retains this priority until the class is paid in full. In a sequential structure, underlying collateral principal repayments are directed to the most senior rated Aaa class in the structure until paid in full, after which principal repayments are directed to the next most senior Aaa class in the structure until it is paid in full. Senior Aaa classes generally share any losses from the underlying collateral on a pro-rata basis after losses are absorbed by classes with lower original ratings.\nThe payment priority and class subordination included in these securities serves as credit enhancement for holders of the senior or top portions of the structures. These securities continue to retain the payment priority features that existed at the origination of the securitization trust. Other forms of credit enhancement may include structural features embedded in the securitization trust, such as overcollateralization, excess spread and bond insurance. The underlying collateral may contain fixed interest rates, variable interest rates (such as adjustable rate mortgages), or both fixed and variable rate features.\nEquity securities\nof $7.06 billion primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust (“REIT”) equity investments. Certain exchange traded and mutual funds have fixed income securities as their underlying investments.\nMortgage loans\nof $821 million mainly comprise loans secured by first mortgages on developed commercial real estate. Key considerations used to manage our exposure include property type and geographic diversification. For further detail on our mortgage loan portfolio, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.\nLimited partnership interests\ninclude $6.34 billion of interests in private equity funds, $920 million of interests in real estate funds and $759 million of interests in other funds as of December 31, 2021. We\nhave commitments to invest additional amounts in limited partnership interests totaling $2.72 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nShort-term investments\nof $4.01 billion primarily comprise money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term investments, including securities lending collateral of $1.40 billion.\nOther investments\nprimarily comprise $1.57 billion of bank loans, $809 million of real estate, $148 million of policy loans and $12 million of derivatives as of December 31, 2021. For further detail on our use of derivatives, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      67\n2021 Form 10-K\nInvestments\nIn general, the gross unrealized losses are related to an increase in market yields, which may include increased risk-free interest rates and wider credit spreads since the time of initial purchase. Similarly, gross unrealized gains reflect a decrease in market yields since the time of initial purchase.\n68      www.allstate.com\nInvestments\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nOther is comprised of communications, financial services, REITs, banking, consumer goods and technology sectors.\nNet investment income\nincreased 107.1% or $1.70 billion in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increases in performance-based income results, mainly from limited partnerships.\nThe Allstate Corporation      69\n2021 Form 10-K\nInvestments\n(1)\nInvestee level expenses include asset level operating expenses reported in investment expense. In 2019, investee level expenses also included depreciation.\nPerformance-based investment income\nincreased 701.6% or $1,733 million in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due to increased valuations and net gains on sales of underlying investments. Performance-based investment income in 2021 includes income generated by certain investments which were classified as assets held for sale in 2020.\nPerformance-based investment results and income can vary significantly between periods and are influenced by economic conditions, equity market performance, comparable public company earnings multiples, capitalization rates, operating performance of the underlying investments and the timing of asset sales.\n(1)\nRelates to limited partnerships where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities.\nSales\nin 2021 related primarily to sales of fixed income securities in connection with ongoing portfolio management and sales of real estate investments. Sales in 2020 related primarily to fixed income securities in connection with ongoing portfolio management.\nValuation change and settlements of derivatives\nin 2021 primarily comprised gains on foreign currency contracts due to the strengthening of the U.S. dollar and gains on interest rate futures used to manage asset duration and reduce exposure to increases in interest rates. 2020 primarily comprised gains on interest rate futures used for asset replication and equity futures used for risk management due to a decrease in indices, partially offset by losses on interest rate futures used for risk management and foreign currency contracts due to weakening of the U.S. dollar.\n70      www.allstate.com\nInvestments\n2021 Form 10-K\nNet gains on performance-based investments and derivatives in 2021 primarily related to gains on sales of real estate investments, increased valuation of equity investments, and gains on valuation and settlement of derivatives. 2020 primarily related to increased valuation of equity investments and gains on sales of real estate investments, partially offset by losses on valuation and settlement of derivatives.\nThe Allstate Corporation      71\n2021 Form 10-K\nMarket Risk\nMarket Risk\nMarket risk is the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in interest rates, credit spreads, equity prices, commodity prices or currency exchange rates. Adverse changes to these rates and prices may occur due to changes in fiscal policy, the economic climate, the liquidity of a market or market segment, insolvency or financial distress of key market makers or participants or changes in market perceptions of credit worthiness or risk tolerance. Our primary market risk exposures are to changes in interest rates, credit spreads and equity prices. We also have direct and indirect exposure to commodity price changes through our diversified investments in timber, agriculture, infrastructure and energy primarily held in limited partnership interests and consolidated subsidiaries.\nThe active management of market risk is integral to our results of operations. We may use the following approaches to manage exposure to market risk within defined tolerance ranges:\n1)\nRebalance existing asset or liability portfolios\n2)\nChange the type of investments purchased in the future\n3)\nUse derivative instruments to modify the market risk characteristics of existing assets and liabilities or assets expected to be purchased\nOverview\nIn formulating and implementing guidelines for investing funds, we seek to earn attractive risk-adjusted returns that enhance our ability to offer competitive prices to customers while contributing to stable profits and long-term capital growth. Accordingly, our investment decisions and objectives are informed by underlying risks. Investment policies define the overall framework for managing market and other investment risks, including accountability and controls over risk management activities. Subsidiaries that conduct investment activities follow policies that have been approved by their respective boards of directors and which specify the investment limits and strategies that are appropriate given the liquidity, surplus, product profile and regulatory requirements of the subsidiary. Executive oversight of investment activities is conducted primarily through the subsidiaries’ boards of directors and legal entity investment committees. The Enterprise Risk and Return Council (“ERRC”) oversees the aggregate risk of Allstate and its subsidiaries. Working in conjunction with the board or the investment committee of each subsidiary, as applicable, the ERRC evaluates the risk tolerance of each subsidiary and determines the aggregate risk tolerance of the enterprise.\nWe use widely-accepted quantitative and qualitative approaches to measure, monitor and manage market risk. We evaluate our market risk exposure using multiple measures including but not limited to:\nIn general, we establish investment portfolio asset allocation and market risk limits based upon a combination of these measures. The asset allocation limits place restrictions on the total funds that may be invested within an asset class. Comprehensive day-to-day management of market risk within defined tolerance ranges occurs as portfolio managers buy and sell within their respective markets based upon the acceptable boundaries established by investment policies. Although we apply a similar overall philosophy to market risk, the underlying business frameworks and the accounting and regulatory environments may differ between our products and therefore affect investment decisions and risk parameters.\nInterest rate risk\nis the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in interest rates. Interest rate risk includes risks related to changes in U.S. Treasury yields and other key risk-free reference yields. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in interest-sensitive assets. Changes in interest rates can have favorable and unfavorable effects on our results. For example, increases in rates can improve investment income, but decrease the fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio which may require us to liquidate assets at losses. Decreases in rates could increase the fair value of our fixed income securities portfolio while decreasing investment income due to reinvesting at lower market yields and accelerating pay-downs and prepayments of certain investments.\nFor our corporate debt, we monitor market interest rates and evaluate refinancing opportunities as maturity dates approach. To mitigate this risk, we ladder the maturity dates of our debt. For our noncumulative perpetual preferred stock, we monitor market dividend rates and evaluate opportunities to redeem or refinance on or after specified dates. For further detail regarding our debt and our preferred stock, see Note 13 of the consolidated financial\n72      www.allstate.com\nMarket Risk\n2021 Form 10-K\nstatements and the Capital Resources and Liquidity section of this Item.\nOur assessment of interest rate risk includes assumptions (based upon historical market experience and our experience) that reflect the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment, leverage or option features of instruments, where applicable. The preceding assumptions relate primarily to callable municipal and corporate bonds, mortgage-backed securities and municipal housing bonds. Additionally, the calculations include assumptions regarding the renewal of property and casualty products. As of December 31, 2021, the fixed income portfolio duration was 4.20 compared to 5.02 as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)\nRepresents an immediate, parallel increase or decrease based on information and assumptions used in the duration calculations and market interest rates as of December 31, 2021.\nTo the extent that conditions differ from the assumptions we used in these calculations, duration and rate shock measures could be significantly impacted. Additionally, our calculations assume the current relationship between short-term and long-term interest rates (the term structure of interest rates) will remain constant over time. As a result, these calculations may not fully capture the effect of non-parallel changes in the term structure of interest rates or large changes in interest rates.\nCredit spread risk\nis the risk that we will incur a loss due to adverse changes in credit spreads (“spreads”). Credit spread is the additional yield on fixed income securities and loans above the risk-free rate (typically referenced as the yield on U.S. Treasury securities) that market participants require to compensate them for assuming credit, liquidity or prepayment risks. The magnitude of the spread will depend on the likelihood that a particular issuer will default. This risk arises from many of our primary activities, as we invest substantial funds in spread-sensitive fixed income assets. We manage the spread risk in our assets. One of the measures used to quantify this exposure is spread duration. Spread duration measures the price sensitivity of the assets to changes in spreads. For example, if spreads increase 100 basis points, the fair value of an asset exhibiting a spread duration of 5 is expected to decrease in value by 5%.\nSpread duration is calculated similarly to interest rate duration. As of December 31, 2021, the spread duration was 4.39 compared to 4.74 as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)\nRepresents an immediate, parallel increase of 100 basis points across all asset classes, industry sectors and credit ratings based on information and assumptions used in the spread duration calculations and market interest rates as of December 31, 2021.\n(2)\nReflects effects of tactical positions that include the use of credit default swaps to manage spread risk.\nEquity price risk\nis the risk that we will incur losses due to adverse changes in the general levels of the markets.\nEquity investments\nAs of December 31, 2021, we held $6.69 billion in equity securities, excluding those with fixed income securities as their underlying investments, and limited partnership interests where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities, compared to $2.52 billion as of December 31, 2020. 97.7% of the common stocks and other investments with public equity risk supported property and casualty products as of December 31, 2021, compared to 95.5% as of December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, these investments had an equity market portfolio beta of 1.06, compared to a beta of 1.07 as of December 31, 2020. Beta represents a widely used methodology to describe, quantitatively, an investment’s market risk characteristics relative to an index such as the Standard & Poor’s 500 Composite Price Index (“S&P 500”).\nWe periodically use put options to reduce equity price risk or call options to adjust our equity risk profile. Put options provide an offset to declines in equity market values below a targeted level, while call options provide participation in equity market appreciation above a targeted level. Options can expire, terminate early or the option can be exercised. If the equity index does not fall below the put’s strike price or rise above the call’s strike price, the maximum loss on purchased puts and calls is limited to the amount of the premium paid.\nLimited partnership interests\nAs of December 31, 2021, we held $7.26 billion in limited partnership interests excluding those limited partnership interests where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities compared to $4.35 billion as of December 31, 2020. All of our limited partnership interests supported property and casualty products as of December 31, 2021 and 2020. These investments are primarily comprised of private equity and real estate funds. These investments are idiosyncratic in nature and a greater portion of the return is derived from asset operating performance. They are not actively\nThe Allstate Corporation      73\n2021 Form 10-K\nMarket Risk\ntraded, and valuation changes typically reflect the performance of the underlying asset.\nFor limited partnership interests, quarterly changes in fair values may not be highly correlated to equity indices in the short term and changes in value of these investments are generally recognized on a three-month delay due to the availability of the related investee financial statements. The illustrations noted above may not reflect our actual experience if the future composition of the portfolio (hence its beta) and correlation relationships differ from the historical relationships.\nForeign currency exchange rate risk\nis the risk that we will incur economic losses due to adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates. This risk primarily arises from our foreign equity investments, including common stocks, limited partnership interests, and our Canada, Northern Ireland and India operations. We use foreign currency derivative contracts to partially offset this risk.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $2.04 billion in foreign currency denominated equity investments, including the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts, $1.30 billion net investment in our foreign subsidiaries, primarily related to our Canada operations, and $27 million in unhedged non-U.S. dollar fixed income securities. These amounts were $671 million, $1.30 billion, and $28 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020.\n(1)\nRepresents a 10% immediate unfavorable change in each of the foreign currency exchange rates to which we are exposed based on information and assumptions used, including the impact of foreign currency derivative contracts.\nThe modeling technique we use to report our currency exposure does not take into account correlation among foreign currency exchange rates. Even though we believe it is very unlikely that all of the foreign currency exchange rates that we are exposed to would simultaneously decrease by 10%, we nonetheless stress test our portfolio under this and other hypothetical extreme adverse market scenarios. Our actual experience may differ from these results because of assumptions we have used or because significant liquidity and market events could occur that we did not foresee.\n74      www.allstate.com\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n2021 Form 10-K\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nCapital resources\nconsist of shareholders’ equity and debt, representing funds deployed or available to be deployed to support business operations or for general corporate purposes.\nShareholders’ equity\ndecreased in 2021, primarily due to loss on disposition from the sales of ALIC, ALNY and certain affiliates, common share repurchases, decreased net unrealized capital gains on investments and dividends paid to shareholders, partially offset by net income. In 2021, we paid dividends of $885 million and $114 million related to our common and preferred shares, respectively. Shareholders’ equity increased in 2020, primarily due to net income and increased net unrealized capital gains on investments, partially offset by common share repurchases, dividends paid to shareholders and redemption of preferred stock. In 2020, we paid dividends of $668 million and $108 million related to our common and preferred shares, respectively.\nCommon share repurchases\nIn August 2021, the Board authorized a new $5.00 billion common share repurchase program that is expected to be completed by March 31, 2023. We also completed the $3.00 billion common share repurchase program that commenced in February 2020.\nIn August 2021, we entered into an accelerated share repurchase agreement (“ASR agreement”) with JP Morgan Chase Bank, to purchase $750 million of our outstanding common stock. Under the ASR agreement, we paid $750 million upfront and initially acquired 4.7 million shares. The ASR agreement concluded on September 17, 2021, and we repurchased a total of 5.6 million shares at an average price of $133.39.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $3.30 billion remaining in the $5.00 billion program.\nDuring 2021, we repurchased 26.3 million common shares, or 8.7% of total common shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020, for $3.26 billion. The common share repurchases were completed through open market transactions and ASR agreements.\nSince 1995, we have acquired 769 million shares of our common stock at a cost of $40.24 billion, primarily as part of various stock repurchase programs. We have reissued 151 million common shares since 1995, primarily associated with our equity incentive plans, the 1999 acquisition of American Heritage Life Investment Corporation and the 2001 redemption of certain mandatorily redeemable preferred securities. Since 1995, total common shares outstanding has decreased by 618 million shares or 68.8%, primarily due to our repurchase programs.\nCommon shareholder dividends\nOn January 4, 2021, April 1, 2021, July 1, 2021, and October 1, 2021, we paid common shareholder dividends of $0.54, $0.81, $0.81 and $0.81, respectively. On November 19, 2021, we declared a common shareholder dividend of $0.81, payable on January 3, 2022.\nRedemption of preferred stock\nOn July 15, 2021, we redeemed all outstanding Depositary shares, representing 1/40th of a share of National General’s 7.50% Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series C and the underlying shares of 7.50% Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, par value $0.01 per share for a total redemption of $200 million.\nThe Allstate Corporation      75\n2021 Form 10-K\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nFinancial ratings and strength\nOur ratings are influenced by many factors including our operating and financial performance, asset quality, liquidity, overall portfolio mix, financial leverage (i.e., debt), exposure to risks such as catastrophes and the current level of operating leverage. The preferred stock and subordinated debentures are viewed as having a common equity component by certain rating agencies and are given equity credit up to a pre-determined limit in our capital structure as determined by their respective methodologies. These respective methodologies consider the existence of certain terms and features in the instruments such as the noncumulative dividend feature in the preferred stock.\nThe Allstate Corporation (the “Corporation”) and Allstate Insurance Company (“AIC”)\nIn January 2021, Moody’s affirmed The Allstate Corporation’s debt and short-term issuer ratings of A3 and P-2, respectively, and the insurance financial strength rating of Aa3 for Allstate Insurance Company (“AIC”). The outlook for the ratings is stable.\nIn June 2021, S&P affirmed the Corporation’s debt and short-term issuer ratings of A- and A-2, respectively, and the insurance financial strength rating of AA- for AIC. The outlook for the ratings is stable.\nIn July 2021, A.M. Best affirmed the Corporation’s debt and short-term issuer ratings of a and AMB-1+, respectively, and the insurance financial strength rating of A+ for AIC. The outlook for the ratings is stable.\nAmerican Heritage Life (“AHL”)\nIn July 2021, A.M. Best affirmed the insurance financial strength rating of A+ for AHL. The outlook for the rating is stable.\nOther property and casualty companies\nWe have distinct and separately capitalized groups of subsidiaries licensed to sell property and casualty insurance that maintain separate group ratings. The\nratings of these groups are influenced by the risks that relate specifically to each group. Many mortgage companies require property owners to have insurance from an insurance carrier with a secure financial strength rating from an accredited rating agency. In July 2021, A.M. Best affirmed the A rating of ANJ, which writes auto and homeowners insurance in New Jersey, and the A+ rating of North Light, our excess and surplus lines carrier. The outlook for the ANJ rating and North Light rating is stable. ANJ also has a Financial Stability Rating\n®\nof A\n\"\nfrom Demotech, which was affirmed in September 2021. In July 2021, A.M. Best affirmed the B+ rating of CKIC, which underwrites personal lines property insurance in Florida. CKIC also has a Financial Stability Rating of A’ from Demotech that was affirmed in August 2021. ANJ, North Light and CKIC do not have support agreements with AIC.\nAllstate’s domestic property and casualty and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Statutory surplus is a measure that is often used as a basis for determining dividend paying capacity, operating leverage and premium growth capacity, and it is also reviewed by rating agencies in determining their ratings.\nThe property and casualty business is comprised of 57 insurance companies as of December 31, 2021, each of which has individual company dividend limitations. As of December 31, 2021, total statutory surplus is $21.51 billion compared to $21.38 billion as of December 31, 2020. Property and casualty subsidiaries surplus was $21.19 billion as of December 31, 2021, compared to $17.13 billion as of December 31, 2020. Life insurance subsidiaries surplus was $322 million as of December 31, 2021, compared to $4.26 billion as of December 31, 2020.\n76      www.allstate.com\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”) has developed financial relationships or tests known as the Insurance Regulatory Information System to assist state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies and identifying companies that require special attention or actions by state insurance regulators. The NAIC analyzes financial data provided by insurance companies using prescribed ratios, each with defined “usual ranges”. Additional regulatory scrutiny may occur if a company’s ratios fall outside the usual ranges for four or more of the ratios. Two of our domestic insurance companies have more than four ratios outside the usual ranges.\nLiquidity sources and uses\nOur potential sources and uses of funds principally include the following activities below.\nContractual obligations and commitments\nWe have short-term and long-term contractual obligations and commitments. We manage our short-term liquidity position to ensure the availability of a sufficient amount of liquid assets to extinguish short-term liabilities as they come due in the normal course of business, including utilizing potential sources of liquidity. Long-term obligations include known\ncontractual commitments that require cash needs beyond 12 months.\nShort-term contractual obligations\nare typically settled with cash or short-term investments and operating cash flows. Most of these obligations are paid within one year. These include unconditional purchase obligations, other liabilities and accrued\nThe Allstate Corporation      77\n2021 Form 10-K\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\nexpenses, including liabilities for collateral and operating leases, and net unrecognized tax benefits.\nWe actively manage our financial position and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic, and business conditions. Liquidity is managed at both the entity and enterprise level across the Company and is assessed on both base and stressed level liquidity needs. We believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet these needs. Additionally, we have existing intercompany agreements in place that facilitate liquidity management across the Company to enhance flexibility.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we held $13.27 billion of cash, U.S. government and agencies fixed income securities, and public equity securities which we would expect to be able to liquidate within one week. In addition, we regularly estimate how much of the total portfolio, which includes high quality corporate fixed income and municipal holdings, can be reasonably liquidated within one quarter. These estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty associated with evolving market conditions. As of December 31, 2021, cash and estimated liquidity available within one quarter, under normal market conditions and at current market prices, was $25.4 billion.\nCertain remote events and circumstances could constrain our liquidity. Those events and circumstances include, for example, a catastrophe resulting in extraordinary losses, a downgrade in our senior long-term debt ratings to non-investment grade status, or a downgrade in AIC’s financial strength ratings. The rating agencies also consider the interdependence of our individually rated entities; therefore, a rating change in one entity could potentially affect the ratings of other related entities.\nThe Allstate Corporation is party to an Amended and Restated Intercompany Liquidity Agreement (“Liquidity Agreement”) with certain subsidiaries, which includes, but is not limited to AIC. The Liquidity Agreement allows for short-term advances of funds to be made between parties for liquidity and other general corporate purposes. The Liquidity Agreement does not establish a commitment to advance funds on the part of any party. AIC serves as a lender and borrower, certain other subsidiaries serve only as borrowers, and the Corporation serves only as a lender. The maximum amount of potential funding under each of these agreements is $1.00 billion.\nIn addition to the Liquidity Agreement, the Corporation also has an intercompany loan agreement with certain of its subsidiaries, which includes, but is not limited to, AIC. The amount of intercompany loans available to the Corporation’s subsidiaries is at the discretion of the Corporation. The maximum amount of loans the Corporation will have outstanding to all its eligible subsidiaries at any given point in time is limited to $1.00 billion. The Corporation may use commercial paper borrowings, bank lines of credit and securities lending to fund intercompany borrowings.\nParent company capital capacity\nAt the parent holding company level, we have deployable assets\ntotaling $3.31 billion as of December 31, 2021, primarily comprised of cash and investments that are generally saleable within one quarter. The substantial earnings capacity of the operating subsidiaries is the primary source of capital generation for the Corporation.\nThe payment of dividends by AIC to The Allstate Corporation is limited by Illinois insurance law to formula amounts based on statutory net income and statutory surplus, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. Based on the greater of 2021 statutory net income or 10% of statutory surplus, the maximum amount of dividends that AIC will be able to pay, without prior Illinois Department of Insurance approval, at a given point in time in 2022 is estimated at $5.51 billion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. Notification and approval of intercompany lending activities are also required by the Illinois Department of Insurance for those transactions that exceed formula amounts based on statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.\nThese holding company assets and subsidiary dividends provide funds for the parent company’s fixed charges and other corporate purposes.\nIntercompany dividends were paid in 2021, 2020 and 2019 between the following companies: AIC, Allstate Insurance Holdings, LLC (“AIH”), the Corporation, ALIC, American Heritage Life Insurance Company (“AHL”) and Allstate Financial Insurance Holdings Corporation (“AFIHC”).\nDividends may not be paid or declared on our common stock and shares of common stock may not be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on our preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for.\nWe are prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on our Series G preferred stock if we fail to meet specified capital adequacy, net income or shareholders’ equity levels, except out of the net proceeds of common stock issued during the 90 days prior to the date of declaration. As of December 31, 2021, we satisfied all the requirements with no current restrictions on the payment of preferred stock dividends. There were no capital contributions paid by the Corporation to AIC in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nThe terms of our outstanding subordinated debentures also prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on our common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on our common stock or preferred stock if we have elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to\n78      www.allstate.com\nCapital Resources and Liquidity\n2021 Form 10-K\ncertain limited exceptions. In 2021, we did not defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures.\nAdditional resources to support liquidity are as follows:\n•\nThe Corporation and AIC have access to a $750 million unsecured revolving credit facility that is available for short-term liquidity requirements. In November 2021, the maturity date of this facility was extended to November 2026. The facility is fully subscribed among 11 lenders with the largest commitment being $95 million. The commitments of the lenders are several and no lender is responsible for any other lender’s commitment if such lender fails to make a loan under the facility. This facility contains an increase provision that would allow up to an additional $500 million of borrowing, subject to the lenders’ commitment. This facility has a financial covenant requiring that we not exceed a 37.5% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. This ratio was 19.0% as of December 31, 2021. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing under it are based on the ratings of our senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. There were no borrowings under the credit facility during 2021.\n•\nTo cover short-term cash needs, the Corporation has access to a commercial paper facility with a borrowing capacity limited to any undrawn credit facility balance up to $750 million.\n•\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were no balances outstanding for the credit facility or the commercial paper facility and therefore the remaining borrowing capacity was $750 million.\n•\nThe Corporation has access to a universal shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission that expires in 2024. We can use this shelf registration to issue an unspecified amount of debt securities, common stock (including 619 million shares of treasury stock as of December 31, 2021), preferred stock, depositary shares, warrants, stock purchase contracts, stock purchase units and securities of trust subsidiaries. The specific terms of any securities we issue under this registration statement will be provided in the applicable prospectus supplements.\nLong-term contractual obligations\nDefined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans (“OPEB”)\nPension plan obligations within the next 12 months represent our planned contributions to certain unfunded non-qualified plans where the benefit obligation exceeds the assets. Obligations beyond 12 months are projected based on the average remaining service period using the current underfunded status of the plans. The OPEB plans’ obligations are estimated based on the expected benefits to be paid. See Note 18 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nReserves for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\nrepresent estimated amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including claims that have been IBNR as of the balance sheet date.\nE\nstimated timing of payments for reserves is based on our historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts that are our best estimates. See Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements and Application of Critical Accounting Estimates section of the MD&A for further information.\nReserve for future policy benefits and contractholder funds\nWe estimate the present value of cash payments to be made to contractholders and policyholders. We are currently making payments for contracts where the timing of a portion or all of the payments has been determined by the contract. Contracts such as voluntary accident and health insurance, interest-sensitive life and traditional life insurance involve payment obligations where a portion or all of the amount and timing of future payments is uncertain. We have estimated the timing of payments related to these contracts based on historical experience and our expectation of future payment patterns. Uncertainties relating to these liabilities include mortality, morbidity, expenses, customer lapse and withdrawal activity, estimated additional deposits for interest-sensitive life contracts, and renewal premium for life policies, which may significantly impact both the timing and amount of future payments. See Note 10 of the consolidated financial statements for further information.\nContractual commitments\nrepresent investment commitments such as private placements, limited partnership interests and other loans. Limited partnership interests are typically funded over the commitment period which is shorter than the contractual expiration date of the partnership and as a result, the actual timing of the funding may vary.\nWe have agreements in place for services we conduct, generally at cost, between subsidiaries relating to insurance, reinsurance, loans and capitalization. All material intercompany transactions have been appropriately eliminated in consolidation. Intercompany transactions among insurance subsidiaries and affiliates have been approved by the appropriate departments of insurance as required.\nFor a more detailed discussion of our off-balance sheet arrangements, see Note 7 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      79\n2021\nForm 10-K\nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\nAllstate is subject to significant risks as an insurer and a provider of other products and services. These risks are discussed in more detail in the Risk Factors section of this document.\nWe regularly identify, measure, manage, monitor and report all significant risks. Major categories of enterprise risk are strategic, insurance, investment, financial, operational and culture.\nAllstate manages these risks through an Enterprise Risk and Return Management (“ERRM”) framework that includes governance, processes, culture, and activities that are performed on an integrated, enterprise-wide basis, following our risk and return principles. Our legal and capital structures are designed to manage capital and solvency on a legal entity basis. Our risk-return principles define how we operate and guide risk and return decision making. These principles state that our priority is to maintain a strong foundation by protecting solvency, complying with laws and acting with integrity. We strive to build strategic value and optimize risk and return.\nGovernance\nERRM governance includes board oversight, an executive management committee, and enterprise and market-facing business chief risk officers.\n•\nThe Allstate Corporation Board of Directors (“Allstate Board”) has overall responsibility for oversight of Management’s design and implementation of ERRM.\n•\nThe Risk and Return Committee (“RRC”) of the Allstate Board oversees effectiveness of the ERRM program, governance structure and risk-related decision-making, while focusing on the Company’s overall risk profile.\n•\nThe Audit Committee oversees the effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting, disclosure controls and procedures as well as\nmanagement’s risk control framework and cybersecurity program.\n•\nThe Enterprise Risk and Return Council (“ERRC”), directs ERRM activities by establishing risk and return targets, determining economic capital levels and monitoring integrated strategies and actions from an enterprise risk and return perspective. The ERRC consists of Allstate’s chief executive officer, vice chair, chief financial officer, chief risk officer and other senior leaders.\n•\nOther key committees work with the ERRC to direct ERRM activities, including the Operating Committee, the Operational Risk and Return Council, the Information Security Council, the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) Steering\n80      www.allstate.com\nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\n2021 Form 10-K\nCommittee, liability governance committees, and investment committees.\nKey risks are assessed and reported through comprehensive ERRM reports prepared for senior management and the RRC. The risk summary report communicates alignment of Allstate’s risk profile with risk and return principles while providing a perspective on risk positioning. Discussion promotes active engagement with management and the RRC. Internal controls over key risks are managed and reported to senior management and the Audit Committee of the Company through a semi-annual risk control dashboard. Annually, we review risks related to the strategic plan, operating plan and incentive compensation programs with the Allstate Board.\nFramework\nWe apply these principles using an integrated ERRM framework that focuses on assessment, transparency and dialogue. Our framework provides a comprehensive view of risks and is used by senior management and business managers to drive risk-return based decisions. We continually validate and improve our ERRM practices by benchmarking and obtaining external perspectives.\nManagement and the ERRC rely on internal and external perspectives to determine an appropriate level of target economic capital. Internal perspectives include enterprise solvency and volatility assessments, stress scenarios, model assumptions and management judgment. External considerations include NAIC risk-based capital as well as S&P’s, Moody’s, and A.M. Best’s capital adequacy measurement. Our economic capital reflects management’s view of the aggregate level of capital necessary to satisfy stakeholder interests, manage Allstate’s risk profile and maintain financial strength. The impact of strategic initiatives on enterprise risk is evaluated through the economic capital framework.\nThe NAIC has adopted the Risk Management and Own Risk and Solvency Assessment Model Act (“ORSA Model Act”), which has been enacted by our insurance subsidiaries’ domiciliary states. The ORSA Model Act requires that insurers maintain a risk management framework and conduct an internal own risk and solvency assessment of the insurer’s material risks in normal and stressed environments. Results of the assessment are filed annually.\nAllstate’s risk appetite is measured through our economic capital framework. The enterprise risk appetite is cascaded into individual risk limits which set boundaries on the amount of risk we are willing to accept from one specific risk category before escalating for further management discussion and action. Risk limits are established based upon expected returns, volatility, potential tail losses and impact on the enterprise portfolio. To effectively operate within risk limits and for risk-return optimization, business units establish risk limits and capital targets specific to their businesses. Allstate’s risk management strategies adapt to changes in business and market environments.\nProcess\nOur ERRM framework establishes a basis for transparency and dialogue across the enterprise and for continuous learning by embedding our risk and return management culture of identifying, assessing, managing, monitoring and reporting risks within the organization. Allstate designs business and enterprise strategies that seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns on capital. Risks are managed at both the legal entity and enterprise level.\nA summary of our process to manage each of our major risk categories follows:\nStrategic risk and return management\naddresses loss associated with inadequate or flawed business planning or strategy setting, including product mix, mergers or acquisitions and market positioning, and unexpected changes within the market or regulatory environment in which Allstate operates. This includes reputational risk, which is the potential for negative publicity regarding a company’s conduct or business practices to adversely impact its profitability, operations, or consumer base, or to require costly litigation and other defensive measures.\nWe manage strategic risk in part through Allstate Board and senior management strategy reviews that include risk and return assessment of our strategic plans and ongoing monitoring of strategic actions, key assumptions and the external competitive environment. Using the ERRM framework, Allstate designs strategies that seek to optimize risk-adjusted returns on economic capital for risk types including interest rate risk, credit risk, equity investments, including those with idiosyncratic return potential, auto profitability and property risk exposure.\nInsurance risk and return management\naddresses fluctuations in the timing, frequency and severity of benefits, expenses, and premiums relative to the return expectations inclusive of systemic risk, concentration of insurance exposures, policy terms, reinsurance coverage, and claims handling practices.\nInsurance risk is the potential for loss due to adverse changes in actual or anticipated insurance claims experience (including claims adjustment expenses), net of reinsurance, and lost future profits. Insurance risk exposures include our operating results and financial condition, claims frequency and severity, and catastrophe and severe weather.\nInsurance risk exposures are measured and monitored with different approaches including:\n•\nStochastic methods: measure and monitor risks such as natural catastrophes and severe weather. We develop probabilistic estimates of risk based on our exposures, historical observed volatility or industry-recognized models in the case of catastrophe risk.\n•\nScenario analysis: measures and monitors risks and estimated losses due to extreme low frequency events that include combined multiple event scenarios across risk categories and time periods.\nThe Allstate Corporation      81\n2021\nForm 10-K\nEnterprise Risk and Return Management\nInvestment risk and return management\naddresses financial loss due to changes in the valuations of assets held in the Allstate investment portfolio. Such losses may be caused by macro developments, such as changes to interest rates, credit spreads and equity price levels, or could be specific to individual investments in the portfolio. These losses can encompass both daily market volatility and permanent impairments of capital due to credit defaults and equity write-downs.\nInvestment risk exposures include interest rate risk, credit spread risk, equity price risk and foreign currency exchange rate risk.\nInvestment risk exposures are measured and monitored in a number of ways including:\n•\nSensitivity analysis: measures the impact from a unit change in a market risk input.\n•\nStochastic and probabilistic estimation of potential losses: combines portfolio risk exposures with historical or recent market volatilities and correlations to assess the potential range of future investment results.\n•\nScenario analysis: measures material adverse outcomes such as shock scenarios applied to credit, public and private equity markets.\nSome of the stress scenarios are a combination of multiple scenarios across risk categories and over multiple time periods, considering the effects of macroeconomic conditions.\nFinancial risk and return management\naddresses the risk of insufficient cash flows to meet corporate or policyholder needs, risk of inadequate aggregate capital or capital within any subsidiary, inability to access capital markets, credit risk that arises when an external party fails to meet a contractual obligation such as reinsurance for ceded claims, or risk associated with a business counterparty default.\nWe actively manage our capital and liquidity levels in light of changing market, economic and business conditions. Our capital position, capital generation capacity, and targeted risk profile provide strategic and financial flexibility.\nWe generally assess solvency on a statutory accounting basis, but also consider holding company capital and liquidity needs. Current enterprise capital, which exceeds economic targeted levels, is based on a combination of statutory surplus and deployable assets at the parent holding company level.\nOperational risk and return management\naddresses loss as a result of the failure of people, processes, or systems. Operational risk exposures include human capital, privacy, regulatory compliance, ethics, fraud, system availability, cybersecurity, data quality, disaster recovery and business continuity.\nOperational risk is managed at the enterprise and market-facing business levels, through an integrated Operational Risk and Return Management (“ORRM”) program, with resources throughout the enterprise identifying, measuring, monitoring, managing, and reporting on operational risks at a detailed level.\nFrom time to time, we engage independent advisers to assess and consult on operational risks. We also perform assessments of the quality of our operational risk program and identify opportunities to strengthen our internal controls.\nCulture risk and return management\naddresses the potential for loss of stakeholder value from a suboptimal work environment, missed opportunities, or ineffective risk management practices. Allstate defines organization culture as a self-sustaining system of shared values, principles and priorities that shape beliefs, drive behavior and influence decision-making within an organization. Allstate’s approach is grounded in its Risk and Return Principles and organized by Our Shared Purpose.\nCulture is managed using a set of cultural risk categories established as a basis for assessment and measurement, and the learning loop is applied to ensure continuous improvement. Results of culture risk assessments are reported to the ERRC and RRC throughout the year. To strengthen oversight, the Culture Risk and Return Management (“CRRM”) team partners with Human Resources and the broader organization to enhance the sophistication of the CRRM framework, including the following key components:\n•\nKey risk categories, defining the most important areas of culture to track and enhance.\n•\nKey risk indicators, reflecting the health of the system, providing early warnings, and helping Allstate prioritize risk and return activities.\n•\nGovernance, ensuring timely discussion, escalation, and prioritization of issues, as well as identification of opportunities.\nMany risk drivers impact more than one of these key risk categories. Examples include risks related to the Coronavirus, inflation, and ESG factors. Such risks are managed within processes listed above, but overall strategy is coordinated at the enterprise level, and holistic governance is provided by cross-functional committees such as the Enterprise Risk and Return Council and ESG Steering Committee.\n82      www.allstate.com\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\n2021 Form 10-K\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to adopt accounting policies and make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. The most critical estimates, presented in the order they appear in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, include those used in determining:\n•\nFair value of financial assets\n•\nImpairment of fixed income securities with credit losses\n•\nBusiness combinations and purchase price allocations\n•\nEvaluation of goodwill\n•\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense estimation\n•\nPension and other postretirement plans net costs and assumptions\nIn making these determinations, management makes subjective and complex judgments that frequently require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain. Many of these policies, estimates and related judgments are common in the insurance and financial services industries; others are specific to our businesses and operations. It is reasonably likely that changes in these estimates could occur from period to period and result in a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.\nA summary of each of these critical accounting estimates follows. For a more detailed discussion of the effect of these estimates on our consolidated financial statements, and the judgments and assumptions related to these estimates, see the referenced sections of this document. For a more detailed summary of our significant accounting policies, see the notes to the consolidated financial statements.\nFair value of financial assets\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. We are responsible for the determination of fair value of financial assets and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. We use independent third-party valuation service providers, broker quotes and internal pricing methods to determine fair values. We obtain or calculate only one single quote or price for each financial instrument.\nValuation service providers typically obtain data about market transactions and other key valuation model inputs from multiple sources and, through the use of proprietary models, produce valuation information in the form of a single fair value for individual fixed income and other securities for which a fair value has been requested under the terms of our agreements. The inputs used by the valuation service providers include, but are not limited to, market prices from recently completed transactions and transactions\nof comparable securities, interest rate yield curves, credit spreads, liquidity spreads, currency rates, and other information, as applicable. Credit and liquidity spreads are typically implied from completed transactions and transactions of comparable securities. Valuation service providers also use proprietary discounted cash flow models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry and similar to those used by other market participants to value the same financial instruments. The valuation models take into account, among other things, market observable information as of the measurement date, as described above, as well as the specific attributes of the security being valued including its term, interest rate, credit rating, industry sector, and where applicable, collateral quality and other issue or issuer specific information. Executing valuation models effectively requires seasoned professional judgment and experience. For certain equity securities, valuation service providers provide market quotations for completed transactions on the measurement date. In cases where market transactions or other market observable data is limited, the extent to which judgment is applied varies inversely with the availability of market observable information.\nFor certain of our financial assets measured at fair value, where our valuation service providers cannot provide fair value determinations, we obtain a single non-binding price quote from a broker familiar with the security who, similar to our valuation service providers, may consider transactions or activity in similar securities among other information. The brokers providing price quotes are generally from the brokerage divisions of financial institutions with market making, underwriting and distribution expertise regarding the security subject to valuation.\nThe fair value of certain financial assets, including privately placed corporate fixed income securities and free-standing derivatives, for which our valuation service providers or brokers do not provide fair value determinations, is developed using valuation methods and models widely accepted in the financial services industry. Our internal pricing methods are primarily based on models using discounted cash flow methodologies that develop a single best estimate of fair value. Our models generally incorporate inputs that we believe are representative of inputs other market participants would use to determine fair value of the same instruments, including yield curves, quoted market prices of comparable securities or instruments, published credit spreads, and other applicable market data as well as instrument-specific characteristics that include, but are not limited to, coupon rates, expected cash flows, sector of the issuer, and call provisions. Because judgment is required in developing the fair values of these financial assets, they may differ from the amount actually received to sell an asset in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Moreover, the use of different valuation assumptions may have a material effect on the financial assets’ fair values.\nThe Allstate Corporation      83\n2021 Form 10-K\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nFor most of our financial assets measured at fair value, all significant inputs are based on or corroborated by market observable data, and significant management judgment does not affect the periodic determination of fair value. The determination of fair value using discounted cash flow models involves management judgment when significant model inputs are not based on or corroborated by market observable data. However, where market observable data is available, it takes precedence, and as a result, no range of reasonably likely inputs exists from which the basis of a sensitivity analysis could be constructed.\nWe gain assurance that our financial assets are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with accounting standards. For fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, our processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately recorded. For example, on a continuing basis, we assess the reasonableness of individual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. We perform procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers.\nIn addition, we may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. We perform ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in internal models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, we validate them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.\nDuring periods of high volatility or market disruption, we may perform an analysis to determine whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity, and if so, whether transactions may not be orderly. Among the indicators we consider in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of market activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, level of credit spreads over historical levels, bid-ask spread, and price consensuses among market participants and sources. If evidence indicates that prices are based on transactions that are not orderly, we place little, if any, weight on the transaction price and will estimate fair value using an internal model. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we did not adjust fair values provided by our valuation service providers or brokers or substitute them with an internal model for such securities.\n(1)\nIncludes $94 million that are valued using broker quotes and $290 million that are valued using quoted prices or quoted net asset values from deal sponsors.\nFor additional detail on fair value measurements, see Note 6 of the consolidated financial statements.\nImpairment of fixed income securities with credit losses\nFor fixed income securities classified as available-for-sale, the difference between amortized cost, net of credit loss allowance (“amortized cost, net”) and fair value, net of certain other items and deferred income taxes (as disclosed in Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements), is reported as a component of AOCI on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position and is not reflected in the operating results of any period until reclassified to net income upon the consummation of a transaction with an unrelated third party or when a credit loss allowance is recorded. We have a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance.\nFor each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, we assess whether management with the appropriate authority\nhas made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not we will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets either of these criteria, any existing credit loss allowance would be written-off against the amortized cost basis of the asset along with any remaining unrealized losses, with the incremental losses recorded in earnings.\nIf we have not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not we will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, we evaluate whether we expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. We calculate the estimated recovery value based on the best estimate of future cash flows considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and\n84      www.allstate.com\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\n2021 Form 10-K\nsupportable forecasts. The estimated future cash flows are discounted at the security’s current effective rate, and are compared to the amortized cost of the security. The determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security are considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, origination vintage year, geographic concentration of underlying collateral, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third-party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, sector credit ratings, financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if we determine that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement.\nIf we do not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, a credit loss allowance is recorded in earnings for the shortfall in expected cash flows; however, the amortized cost, net of the credit loss allowance, may not be lower than the fair value of the security. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in AOCI. If we determine that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, we may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.\nWhen a security is sold or otherwise disposed or the security is deemed uncollectible and written off, we remove amounts previously recognized in the credit loss allowance. Recoveries after write-offs are recognized when received.\nFor additional detail on investment impairments, see Note 5 of the consolidated financial statements.\nBusiness combinations and purchase price allocations\nWe have acquired significant intangible assets through acquisitions of businesses. Intangible assets (reported in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position) consist of capitalized costs, primarily of the estimated fair value of distribution and customer relationships, trade names, licenses and technology assets. The estimated useful lives of these assets generally range from 3 to 10 years.\nOn January 4, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. (“National General”), an insurance holding company serving customers predominantly through independent agents for property and casualty and\naccident and health products. The estimated fair value of distribution and customer relationship intangible assets was determined using an income approach that considered cash flows and profits expected to be generated by the acquired relationships, a weighted-average cost of capital discount rate reflecting the relative risk of achieving the anticipated cash flows, profits, the time value of money, and other relevant inputs. Technology and trade names were valued using estimated useful lives and market licensing rates discounted at a weighted-average cost of capital. Licenses are primarily insurance licenses which were valued using the median value of market transactions executed over an extended observation period.\nValue of business acquired\n(reported in DAC in the  Consolidated Statements of Financial Position) recognized in connection with the acquisition of National General represents the value of future profits expected to be earned over the lives of the contracts acquired determined using a weighted-average cost of capital discount and other relevant assumptions. These costs are amortized over the policy term of the contracts in force at the acquisition date, generally over six or twelve months.\nEvaluation of goodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less any impairment of goodwill recognized. Goodwill is recognized when acquired and allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Our goodwill reporting units are equivalent to our reportable segments: Allstate Protection, Protection Services, and Allstate Health and Benefits to which goodwill has been assigned.\nThe goodwill balance was $3.50 billion and $2.37 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. During 2021, our goodwill increased primarily reflecting the acquisition of National General and SafeAuto.\nUpon acquisition, the purchase price of the acquired business is assumed to be its fair value. Subsequently, we estimate the fair value of our businesses in each goodwill reporting unit, utilizing a combination of widely accepted valuation techniques including a stock price and market capitalization analysis, discounted cash flow (“DCF”) calculations and an estimate of a business’s fair value using market to book multiples derived from peer company analysis. The stock price and market capitalization analysis takes into consideration the quoted market price of our outstanding common stock and includes a control premium, derived from relevant historical acquisition activity, in determining the estimated fair value of the consolidated entity before allocating that fair value to individual reporting units. The DCF analysis utilizes long term assumptions for revenues, investment income, benefits, claims, other operating expenses and income taxes to produce projections of both income and cash flows available for dividends that are present valued using the weighted average cost of capital. Market to book multiples represent the mean market to book multiple for selected peer companies with operations similar to our goodwill reporting units to\nThe Allstate Corporation      85\n2021 Form 10-K\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nwhich the multiple is applied. The outputs from these methods are weighted based on the nature of the business and the relative amount of market observable assumptions supporting the estimates. The computed values are then weighted to reflect the fair value estimate based on the specific attributes of each goodwill reporting unit.\nEstimating the fair value of reporting units is a subjective process that involves the use of significant estimates by management. Changes in market inputs or other events impacting the fair value of these businesses, including discount rates, operating results, investment returns, strategies and growth rate assumptions, among other factors, could result in goodwill impairments, resulting in a charge to income. Certain of our goodwill reporting units are comprised of a combination of legacy and acquired businesses and as a result have substantial internally generated and unrecognized intangibles and fair values that significantly exceed their carrying values.\nOur Protection Services goodwill reporting unit is more heavily comprised of newly acquired businesses and as a result does not have a significant excess of fair value over its carrying value attributable to internally generated unrecognized intangibles. Therefore, this reporting unit may be more susceptible to potential future goodwill impairment based on changes to growth or margin assumptions.\nThe most significant assumptions utilized in the determination of the estimated fair value of the Protection Services reporting unit are the earnings growth rate and discount rate. The growth rate utilized in our fair value estimates is consistent with our plans to grow these businesses more rapidly over the near-term with more moderated growth rates in later years.\nThe discount rate, which is consistent with the weighted average cost of capital expected by a market participant, is based upon industry specific required rates of return, including consideration of both debt and equity components of the capital structure. Our discount rate may be impacted by changes in the risk-free rate, cost of debt, equity risk premium and entity specific risks.\nChanges in our growth assumptions, including the risk of loss of key customers, or adverse changes in the discount rates could result in a decline in fair value and result in a goodwill impairment charge.\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\nestimation\nReserves are established to provide for the estimated costs of paying claims and claims expenses under insurance policies we have issued. Underwriting results are significantly influenced by estimates of property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense reserves. These reserves are an estimate of amounts necessary to settle all outstanding claims, including IBNR, as of the financial statement date.\nCharacteristics of reserves\nReserves are established independently of business segment management for each business segment and line of business based on estimates of the ultimate cost to\nsettle claims, less losses that have been paid. The significant lines of business are auto, homeowners, and other personal lines for Allstate Protection, and asbestos, environmental, and other run-off lines for Run-off Property-Liability. Allstate Protection’s claims are typically reported promptly with relatively little reporting lag between the date of occurrence and the date the loss is reported. Auto and homeowners liability losses generally take an average of about two years to settle, while auto physical damage, homeowners property and other personal lines have an average settlement time of less than one year. Run-off Property-Liability involves long-tail losses, such as those related to asbestos and environmental claims, which often involve substantial reporting lags and extended times to settle.\nReserves are the difference between the estimated ultimate cost of losses incurred and the amount of paid losses as of the reporting date. Reserves are estimated for both reported and unreported claims, and include estimates of all expenses associated with processing and settling all incurred claims. We update most of our reserve estimates quarterly and as new information becomes available or as events emerge that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in prior reserve estimates (reserve reestimates), which may be material, are determined by comparing updated estimates of ultimate losses to prior estimates, with the differences recorded as property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined. Estimating the ultimate cost of claims and claims expenses is an inherently uncertain and complex process involving a high degree of judgment and is subject to the evaluation of numerous variables.\nThe actuarial methods used to develop reserve estimates\nReserve estimates are derived by using several different actuarial estimation methods that are variations on one primary actuarial technique. The actuarial technique is known as a “chain ladder” estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident year or a report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. An accident year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims occurred. A report year refers to classifying claims based on the year in which the claims are reported. Both classifications are used to prepare estimates of required reserves for payments to be made in the future. The key assumptions affecting our reserve estimates comprise data elements including claim counts, paid losses, case reserves, and development factors calculated with this data.\nSee Run-off Property-Liability reserve estimates section for specific disclosures of industry and actuarial best practices for this segment.\nIn the chain ladder estimation technique, a ratio (development factor) is calculated which compares current period results to results in the prior period for\n86      www.allstate.com\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\n2021 Form 10-K\neach accident year. Typically, a multi-year average development factor, based on historical results, is used to estimate the development of losses of each accident year into the next time period. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process, the implicit assumption being that a development factor includes an adequate provision. The development factor estimation methodology may require modification when data changes due to changing claim reporting practices, changing claim settlement patterns, external regulatory or financial influences, or contractual coverage changes. The modifications include exclusion of unusual losses or aberrations and adjustment of historical data to present conditions. Actuarial judgment is then applied to develop a best estimate of gross ultimate losses. These developments are discussed further in the loss ratio disclosures within the Allstate Protection Segment and the Claims and Claims Expense Reserves sections of the MD&A.\nHow reserve estimates are established and updated\nReserve estimates are developed at a very detailed level, and the results are aggregated to form a consolidated reserve estimate. The detailed estimates include each line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), major states or groups of states and for reported losses and IBNR. The actuarial methods described above are used to analyze the settlement patterns of claims used in the reserve estimation process. Development factors are calculated for data elements such as claim counts reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. The calculation of development factors from changes in these data elements also impacts claim severity trends. The historical development patterns for these data elements are used to calculate reserve estimates.\nEstimates are prepared for each detailed component, incorporating alternative analyses of changing claim settlement patterns and other influences on losses, from which we select our best estimate. Actuarial judgments that may be applied to these components generally do not have a material impact on the consolidated level of reserves. Based on this review our best estimate of required reserves is\nrecorded.\nReserves are reestimated quarterly and periodically throughout the year, by combining historical results with current actual results to calculate new development factors. This process continuously incorporates the historic and latest actual trends, and other underlying changes in the data elements used to calculate reserve estimates. New development factors are likely to differ from previous development factors used in prior reserve estimates because actual results (claims reported or settled, losses paid, or changes to case reserves) occur differently than the assumptions contained in the previous development factor calculations. When actual development of these data elements is different than the historical development pattern used in a prior period reserve estimate, a new reserve is determined. The difference between indicated reserves based on new reserve estimates and recorded reserves (the previous estimate) is the amount of reserve reestimate and is recognized as an increase or decrease in claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. A more detailed discussion of reserve reestimates is presented in the Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.\n(1)\n2020 includes approximately $495 million of favorable reserve reestimates related to the PG&E Corporation and Southern California Edison subrogation settlements.\n(1)\nFavorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\n(2)\nEach of these results is consistent within a reasonable actuarial tolerance for the respective businesses.\n(1)\n2021 includes the unamortized fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of National General.\nThe Allstate Corporation      87\n2021 Form 10-K\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nAllstate Protection reserve estimate\nFactors affecting reserve estimates\nReserve estimates are developed based on the processes and historical development trends described above. These estimates are considered in conjunction with known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including our experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes in law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic conditions. When we experience changes of the type previously mentioned, we may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors considered more reflective of the new trends, such as combining shorter or longer periods of historical results with current actual results to produce development factors based on two-year, three-year, or longer development periods to reestimate our reserves. For example:\n•\nThe Coronavirus has had a significant impact on driving patterns and auto frequency that may lead to historical development trends being less predictive of future loss development, potentially creating additional reserve variability.\n•\nIf a legal change is expected to have a significant impact on the development of claim severity for a coverage which is part of a particular line of insurance in a specific state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors that will most accurately reflect the expected impact on that specific estimate.\n•\nA change in economic conditions is expected to affect the cost of repairs to damaged autos or property for a particular line, coverage, or state, actuarial judgment is applied to determine appropriate development factors to use in the reserve estimate that will most accurately reflect the expected impacts on severity development.\nAs claims are reported, for certain liability claims of sufficient size and complexity, the field adjusting staff establishes case reserve estimates of ultimate cost, based on their assessment of facts and circumstances related to each individual claim. For other claims which occur in large volumes and settle in a relatively short time frame, it is not practical or efficient to set case reserves for each claim, and a statistical case reserve is set for these claims based on estimation techniques described above. In the normal course of business, we may also supplement our claims processes by utilizing third-party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims.\nHistorically, the case reserves set by the field adjusting staff have not proven to be an entirely accurate estimate of the ultimate cost of claims. To provide for this, a development reserve is estimated using the processes described above and allocated to pending claims as a supplement to case reserves. Typically, the case, including statistical case, and\nsupplemental development reserves comprise about 90% of total reserves.\nAnother major component of reserves is IBNR, which comprises about 10% of total reserves. IBNR can be a small percentage of reserves for relatively short-term claims, such as auto physical damage claims, or a large percentage of reserves for claims that have uncertain payout requirements over a long period of time, such as auto injury and MCCA claims. All major components of reserves are affected by changes in claim frequency as well as claim severity.\nGenerally, the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on actual claim frequency and severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators. Reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using processes described above. Changes in auto claim frequency may result from changes in mix of business, the rate of distracted driving, miles driven or other macroeconomic factors. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors of the economy, the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim practices and changes in mix of claim type. We mitigate these effects through various loss management programs. Injury claims are affected largely by medical cost inflation while physical damage claims are affected largely by auto repair cost inflation and used car prices. For auto physical damage coverages, we monitor our rate of increase in average cost per claim against the auto maintenance, repair, parts and equipment price indices. We believe our claim settlement initiatives, such as improvements to the claim review and settlement process, the use of special investigative units to detect fraud and handle suspect claims, litigation management and defense strategies, as well as various other loss management initiatives underway, contribute to the mitigation of injury and physical damage severity trends.\nChanges in homeowners current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the cost of building materials, the cost of construction and property repair services, the cost of replacing home furnishings and other contents, the types of claims that qualify for coverage, deductibles, other economic and environmental factors and the effectiveness and efficiency of our claim practices.\nAs loss experience for the current year develops for each type of loss, it is monitored relative to initial assumptions until it is judged to have sufficient statistical credibility. From that point in time and forward, reserves are reestimated using statistical actuarial processes to reflect the impact actual loss trends have on development factors incorporated into the actuarial estimation processes.\nThe very detailed processes for developing reserve estimates, and the lack of a need and existence of a common set of assumptions or development factors, limits aggregate reserve level testing for variability of data elements. However, by applying standard\n88      www.allstate.com\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\n2021 Form 10-K\nactuarial methods to consolidated historic accident year loss data for major loss types, comprising auto injury losses, auto physical damage losses and homeowner losses, we develop variability analyses consistent with the way we develop reserves by measuring the potential variability of development factors, as described in the section titled “Potential Reserve Estimate Variability” below.\nCauses of reserve estimate uncertainty\nSince reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of claims and claims expenses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, requires regular reevaluation and refinement of estimates to determine our ultimate loss estimate.\nAt each reporting date, the highest degree of uncertainty in estimates for most of our losses from ongoing businesses arise from claims remaining to be settled for the current accident year and the most recent preceding accident year. The greatest degree of uncertainty exists in the current accident year because the current accident year contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled but must be estimated as of the current reporting date. Most of these losses relate to damaged property such as automobiles and homes, and medical care for injuries from accidents. During the first year after the end of an accident year, a large portion of the total losses for that accident year are settled. When accident year losses paid through the end of the first year following the initial accident year are incorporated into updated actuarial estimates, the trends inherent in the settlement of claims emerge more clearly. Consequently, this is the point in time at which we tend to make our largest reestimates of losses for an accident year. After the second year, the losses that we pay for an accident year typically relate to claims that are more difficult to settle, such as those involving serious injuries or litigation. Private passenger auto insurance provides a good illustration of the uncertainty of future loss estimates: our typical annual percentage payout of reserves remaining at December 31 for an accident year is approximately 45% in the first year after the end of the accident year, 20% in the second year, 15% in the third year, 10% in the fourth year, and the remaining 10% thereafter.\nReserves for catastrophe losses\nCatastrophe losses\nare an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance industry that have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to potentially material year-to-year fluctuations in our results of operations and financial position. We define a “catastrophe” as an event that produces pre-tax losses before reinsurance in excess of $1 million and involves multiple first party policyholders, or a winter weather event that produces a number of claims in excess of a preset, per-event threshold of average claims in a specific area, occurring within a certain amount of time following the event. Catastrophes are caused by various natural events including high winds, winter storms and freezes, tornadoes, hailstorms, wildfires, tropical storms, hurricanes, earthquakes and volcanoes. We are also exposed to man-made catastrophic events, such as\ncertain types of terrorism or industrial accidents. The nature and level of catastrophes in any period cannot be reliably predicted.\nThe estimation of claims and claims expense reserves for catastrophe losses also comprises estimates of losses from reported claims and IBNR, primarily for damage to property. In general, our estimates for catastrophe reserves are based on claim adjuster inspections and the application of historical loss development factors as described above. However, depending on the nature of the catastrophe, the estimation process can be further complicated. For example, for hurricanes, complications could include the inability of insureds to promptly report losses, limitations placed on claims adjusting staff affecting their ability to inspect losses, determining whether losses are covered by our homeowners policy (generally for damage caused by wind or wind driven rain) or specifically excluded coverage caused by flood, estimating additional living expenses, and assessing the impact of demand surge, exposure to mold damage, and the effects of numerous other considerations, including the timing of a catastrophe in relation to other events, such as at or near the end of a financial reporting period, which can affect the availability of information needed to estimate reserves for that reporting period. In these situations, we may need to adapt our practices to accommodate these circumstances in order to determine a best estimate of our losses from a catastrophe. For example, to complete estimates for certain areas affected by catastrophes not yet inspected by our claims adjusting staff, or where we believed our historical loss development factors were not predictive, we rely on analysis of actual claim notices received compared to total PIF, as well as visual, governmental and third-party information, including aerial photos, using satellites, aircrafts and drones, area observations, and data on wind speed and flood depth to the extent available.\nPotential reserve estimate variability\nThe aggregation of numerous micro-level estimates for each business segment, line of insurance, major components of losses (such as coverages and perils), and major states or groups of states for reported losses and IBNR forms the reserve liability recorded in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. Because of this detailed approach to developing our reserve estimates, there is not a single set of assumptions that determines our reserve estimates at the consolidated level. Given the numerous micro-level estimates for reported losses and IBNR, management does not believe the processes that we follow will produce a statistically credible or reliable actuarial reserve range that would be meaningful. Reserve estimates, by their very nature, are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgment, and do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. Accordingly, as actual claims, paid losses, and case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle will be different than previously estimated.\nTo develop a statistical indication of potential\nThe Allstate Corporation      89\n2021 Form 10-K\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nreserve variability within reasonably likely possible outcomes, an actuarial technique (stochastic modeling) is applied to the countrywide consolidated data elements for paid losses and paid losses combined with case reserves separately for injury losses, auto physical damage losses, and homeowners losses excluding catastrophe losses. Based on the combined historical variability of the development factors calculated for these data elements, an estimate of the standard error or standard deviation around these reserve estimates is calculated within each accident year for the last twelve years for each type of loss. The variability of these reserve estimates within one standard deviation of the mean (a measure of frequency of dispersion often viewed to be an acceptable level of accuracy) is believed by management to represent a reasonable and statistically probable measure of potential variability. Based on our products and coverages, historical experience, the statistical credibility of our extensive data and stochastic modeling of actuarial chain ladder methodologies used to develop reserve estimates, we estimate that the potential variability of our Allstate Protection reserves, excluding reserves for catastrophe losses, within a reasonable probability of other possible outcomes, may be approximately plus or minus 4%, or plus or minus $900 million in net income applicable to common shareholders. A lower level of variability exists for auto injury losses, which comprise approximately 80% of reserves, due to their relatively stable development patterns over a longer duration of time required to settle claims. Other types of losses, such as auto physical damage, homeowners losses and other personal lines losses, which comprise about 20% of reserves, tend to have greater variability but are settled in a much shorter period of time. Although this evaluation reflects most reasonably likely outcomes, it is possible the final outcome may fall below or above these amounts. Historical variability of reserve estimates is reported in the Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.\nReserves for Michigan and New Jersey unlimited personal injury protection\nClaims and claims expense reserves include reserves for Michigan mandatory unlimited personal injury protection coverage to insureds involved in qualifying motor vehicle accidents. The administration of this program is through the MCCA, a state-mandated, non-profit association of which all insurers actively writing automobile coverage in Michigan are members.\nThe process employed to estimate MCCA covered losses involves a number of activities including the comprehensive review and interpretation of MCCA actuarial reports, other MCCA members’ reports and our personal injury protection loss trends which have increased in severity over time. A significant portion of incurred claim reserves can be attributed to a small number of catastrophic claims and thus a large portion of the recoverable is similarly concentrated. We conduct comprehensive claim file reviews to develop case reserve type estimates of specific claims, which inform our view of future claim development and longevity of claimants. Each year, we update the actuarial estimate of our ultimate reserves and\nrecoverables. We report our paid and unpaid claims based on MCCA requirements. The MCCA develops its own reserving estimates based on its own reserve methodologies, which may not align with our estimations. The MCCA does not provide member companies with its estimate of a company’s claim costs. We continue to update each comprehensive claim file case reserve estimate when there is a significant change in the status of the claimant, or once every three years if there have been no significant changes.\nWe provide similar personal injury protection coverage in New Jersey for auto policies issued or renewed in New Jersey prior to 1991 that is administered by PLIGA. We use similar actuarial estimating techniques as for the MCCA exposures to estimate loss reserves for unlimited personal injury protection coverage for policies covered by PLIGA. We continue to update our estimates for these claims as the status of claimant’s changes. However, unlimited coverage was no longer offered after 1991; therefore, no new claimants are being added.\nReserve estimates are confidential and proprietary and by their nature are very complex to determine and subject to significant judgments. Reserve estimates do not represent an exact determination for each outstanding claim. Claims may be subject to litigation. As actual claims, paid losses and case reserve results emerge, our estimate of the ultimate cost to settle may be materially greater or less than previously estimated amounts.\nFor additional information related to indemnification recoverables, see Item 1 - Regulation, Indemnification Programs and Note 11 of the consolidated financial statements.\nAdequacy of reserve estimates\nWe believe our net claims and claims expense reserves are appropriately established based on available methodologies, facts, technology, laws and regulations. We calculate and record a single best reserve estimate, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards and practices, for each line of insurance, its components (coverages and perils) and state, for reported losses and for IBNR losses, and as a result we believe that no other estimate is better than our recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on our best estimates.\nRun-off Property-Liability reserve estimates\nCharacteristics of Run-off exposure\nOur exposure to asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims arise principally from assumed reinsurance coverage written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s, including reinsurance on primary insurance written on large U.S. companies, and from direct excess commercial insurance written from 1972 through 1985, including substantial excess general liability coverages on large U.S. companies. Additional exposure stems from direct primary commercial insurance written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Asbestos claims relate primarily to bodily injuries asserted by claimants who were exposed to asbestos or products\n90      www.allstate.com\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\n2021 Form 10-K\ncontaining asbestos. Environmental claims relate primarily to pollution and related clean-up costs. Other run-off claims exposures primarily relate to general liability and product liability mass tort claims, such as those for medical devices and other products, workers’ compensation claims and claims for various other coverage exposures other than asbestos and environmental.\nIn 1986, the general liability policy form used by us and others in the property and casualty industry was amended to introduce an “absolute pollution exclusion,” which excluded coverage for environmental damage claims, and to add an asbestos exclusion. Most general liability policies issued prior to 1987 contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage. General liability policies issued in 1987 and thereafter contain annual aggregate limits for product liability coverage and annual aggregate limits for all coverages. Our experience to date is that these policy form changes have limited the extent of our exposure to environmental and asbestos claim risks.\nOur exposure to liability for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims losses manifests differently depending on whether it arises from assumed reinsurance coverage, direct excess commercial insurance or direct primary commercial insurance. The direct insurance coverage we provided that covered asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims was substantially “excess” in nature.\nDirect excess commercial insurance and reinsurance involve coverage written by us for specific layers of protection above retentions and other insurance plans. The nature of excess coverage and reinsurance provided to other insurers limits our exposure to loss to specific layers of protection in excess of policyholder retention on primary insurance plans. Our exposure is further limited by the significant reinsurance that we had purchased on our direct excess business.\nOur assumed reinsurance business involved writing generally small participations in other insurers’ reinsurance programs. The reinsured losses in which we participate may be a proportion of all eligible losses or eligible losses in excess of defined retentions. Of the majority of our assumed reinsurance exposure, approximately 85%, is for excess of loss coverage, while the remaining 15% is for pro-rata coverage.\nOur direct primary commercial insurance business did not include coverage to large asbestos manufacturers. This business comprises a cross section of policyholders engaged in many diverse business sectors throughout the country.\nHow reserve estimates are established and updated\nWe conduct an annual review in the third quarter to evaluate, establish and adjust as necessary, asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims reserves. Changes to reserves are recorded in the reporting period in which they are determined. Using established industry and actuarial best practices and assuming no change in the regulatory or economic environment, this detailed and comprehensive methodology determines asbestos reserves based on\nassessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, and determines environmental reserves based on assessments of the characteristics of exposure (i.e. environmental damages, respective shares of liability of potentially responsible parties, appropriateness and cost of remediation) to pollution and related clean-up costs. The number and cost of these claims are affected by advertising by trial lawyers seeking asbestos plaintiffs, and entities with asbestos exposure seeking bankruptcy protection as a result of asbestos liabilities, initially causing a delay in the reporting of claims, often followed by an acceleration and an increase in claims and claims expenses as settlements occur.\nAfter evaluating our insureds’ probable liabilities for asbestos and environmental claims, we evaluate our insureds’ coverage programs for such claims. We consider our insureds’ total available insurance coverage, including the coverage we issued. We also consider relevant judicial interpretations of policy language and applicable coverage defenses or determinations, if any.\nEvaluation of both the insureds’ estimated liabilities and our exposure to the insureds depends heavily on an analysis of the relevant legal issues and litigation environment. This analysis is conducted by our specialized claims adjusting staff and legal counsel. Based on these evaluations, case reserves are established by claims adjusting staff and actuarial analysis is employed to develop an IBNR reserve, which includes estimated potential reserve development and claims that have occurred but have not been reported. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, IBNR was 54.8% and 50.3%, respectively, of combined net asbestos and environmental reserves.\nFor both asbestos and environmental reserves, we also evaluate our historical direct net loss and expense paid and incurred experience to assess any emerging trends, fluctuations or characteristics suggested by the aggregate paid and incurred activity. Other run-off claims reserves are based on considerations similar to those described above, as they relate to the characteristics of specific individual coverage exposures.\nPotential reserve estimate variability\nEstablishing Run-off Property-Liability net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims is subject to uncertainties that are much greater than those presented by other types of property and casualty claims. Among the complications are lack of historical data, long reporting delays, uncertainty as to the number and identity of insureds with potential exposure and unresolved legal issues regarding policy coverage; unresolved legal issues regarding the determination, availability and timing of exhaustion of policy limits; plaintiffs’ evolving and expanding theories of liability; availability and collectability of recoveries from reinsurance; retrospectively determined premiums and other contractual agreements; estimates of the extent and timing of any contractual liability; the impact of bankruptcy protection sought by\nThe Allstate Corporation      91\n2021 Form 10-K\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\nvarious asbestos producers and other asbestos defendants; and other uncertainties. There are also complex legal issues concerning the interpretation of various insurance policy provisions and whether those losses are covered, or were ever intended to be covered, and could be recoverable through retrospectively determined premium, reinsurance or other contractual agreements. Courts have reached different and sometimes inconsistent conclusions as to when losses are deemed to have occurred and which policies provide coverage; what types of losses are covered; whether there is an insurer obligation to defend; how policy limits are determined; how policy exclusions and conditions are applied and interpreted; and whether clean-up costs represent insured property damage. Our reserves for asbestos and environmental exposures could be affected by tort reform, class action litigation, and other potential legislation and judicial decisions. Environmental exposures could also be affected by a change in the existing federal Superfund law and similar state statutes. There can be no assurance that any reform legislation will be enacted or that any such legislation will provide for a fair, effective and cost-efficient system for settlement of asbestos or environmental claims. We believe these issues are not likely to be resolved in the near future, and the ultimate costs may vary materially from the amounts currently recorded resulting in material changes in loss reserves. Historical variability of reserve estimates is demonstrated in the Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.\nAdequacy of reserve estimates\nManagement believes its net loss reserves for asbestos, environmental and other run-off claims exposures are appropriately established based on available facts, technology, laws, regulations, and assessments of other pertinent factors and characteristics of exposure (i.e. claim activity, potential liability, jurisdiction, products versus non-products exposure) presented by individual policyholders, assuming no change in the legal, legislative or economic environment. Due to the uncertainties and factors described above, management believes it is not practicable to develop a meaningful range for any such additional net loss reserves that may be required.\nFurther discussion of reserve estimates\nFor further discussion of these estimates and quantification of the impact of reserve estimates, reserve reestimates and assumptions, see Note 9 and Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements and the Claims and Claims Expense Reserves section of the MD&A.\nPension and other postretirement plans net costs and assumptions\nOur defined benefit pension plans cover most full-time employees, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. Benefits are provided to plan participants based on a cash balance formula. Certain participants have a significant portion of their benefits attributable to a former final average pay formula. 84% of the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) of our primary qualified employee plan is related to the former final average pay formula. See\nNote 18 of the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these plans and their effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nOur pension and other postretirement benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include discount rates, health care cost trend rates, inflation, expected returns on plan assets, mortality and other factors. The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our pension plans represent our best estimates and we believe they are reasonable based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.\nNet costs for our defined benefit plans are recognized on the Consolidated Statements of Operations and consist of two elements: 1) costs comprised of service and interest costs, expected return of plan assets, amortization of prior service credit and curtailment gains and losses which are reported in property and casualty claims and claims expense, operating costs and expenses, net investment income and, if applicable, restructuring and related charges and 2) remeasurement gains and losses comprised of changes in actuarial assumptions and the difference between actual and expected returns on plan assets which are recognized immediately in earnings as part of pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses.\nWe recognize expected returns on plan assets using an unadjusted fair value method. Our policy is to remeasure our pension and postretirement plans on a quarterly basis. We immediately recognize remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets in earnings as it provides greater transparency of our economic obligations in accounting results and better aligns the recognition of the effects of economic and interest rate changes on pension and other postretirement plan assets and liabilities in the year in which the gains and losses are incurred.\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions affect our pension and other postretirement obligations, plan assets and expenses. The primary factors contributing to pension and postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are 1) changes in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement obligations as of the measurement date, 2) differences between the expected and the actual return on plan assets and 3) changes in demographic assumptions, including mortality and participant experience.\nPension and other postretirement service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits are allocated to our reportable segments. The pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are reported in the Corporate and Other segment.\n92      www.allstate.com\nApplication of Critical Accounting Estimates\n2021 Form 10-K\nImpact of assumption changes to net cost for pension and other postretirement plans\nRemeasurement gains in 2021 primarily related to favorable asset performance compared to the expected return on plan assets and an increase in the liability discount rate. Remeasurement gains in 2020 primarily related to favorable asset performance compared to the expected return on plan assets, partially offset by a decrease in the discount rate and changes in actuarial assumptions.\nThe discount rate is based on rates at which expected pension benefits attributable to past employee service could effectively be settled on a present value basis at the measurement date. We develop the assumed discount rate by utilizing the weighted average yield of a theoretical dedicated portfolio derived from non-callable bonds and callable bonds with a make-whole provision available in the Bloomberg corporate bond universe having ratings of at least “AA” by S&P or at least “Aa” by Moody’s on the measurement date with cash flows that match expected plan benefit requirements. Significant changes in discount rates, such as those caused by changes in the credit spreads, yield curve, the mix of bonds available in the market, the duration of selected bonds and expected benefit payments, may result in volatility in pension cost. The weighted average discount rate used to measure the benefit obligation increased to 2.93% in 2021 compared to 2.51% in 2020, resulting in gains for 2021.\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. While this rate reflects long-term assumptions and is consistent with long-term historical returns, sustained changes in the market or changes in\nthe mix of plan assets may lead to revisions in the assumed long-term rate of return on plan assets that may result in variability of pension cost. Differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets are immediately recognized through earnings upon remeasurement. Short-term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return, especially in volatile markets. In 2021, the actual return on plan assets was higher than the expected return primarily due to strong equity market performance. In 2020, the actual return on plan assets was higher than the expected return primarily due to a decline in interest rates which increased the fair value of our fixed income investments and strong equity market performance.\nWe complete periodic evaluations of demographic information and historical experience that affects our pension and other postretirement obligations to identify any required changes to long-term actuarial assumptions and methodologies. Demographic assumptions affect both our pension and postretirement plans and include elements such as retirement rates and participation rates in our postretirement programs, among other factors.\nThese actuarial assumption updates affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and are incorporated into our best estimates of these assumptions. Remeasurement losses for other assumptions in 2020 primarily related to a decrease in lump sum interest rates and changes in the estimated percentage of employees taking lump sum distributions.\nThe Allstate Corporation      93\n2021 Form 10-K\nRegulation and Legal Proceedings\nWe are subject to extensive regulation and we are involved in various legal and regulatory actions, all of which have an effect on specific aspects of our business. For a detailed discussion of the legal and regulatory actions in which we are involved, see Note 15 of the consolidated financial statements.\nPending Accounting Standard\nThere is a pending accounting standard that we have not implemented because the implementation date has not yet occurred. For a discussion of this pending standard, see Note 2 of the consolidated financial statements.\nThe effect of implementing certain accounting standards on our financial results and financial condition is often based in part on market conditions at the time of implementation of the standard and other factors we are unable to determine prior to implementation. For this reason, we are sometimes unable to estimate the effect of certain pending accounting standards until the relevant authoritative body finalizes these standards or until we implement them."

These consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“GAAP”). All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated.\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nNature of operations\nAllstate is engaged, principally in the United States, in the property and casualty insurance business. Allstate is one of the country’s largest personal property and casualty insurers and is organized into\nfive\nreportable segments: Allstate Protection, Run-off Property Liability (previously Discontinued Lines and Coverages), Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits (previously Allstate Benefits), and Corporate and Other.\nAllstate’s primary business is the sale of private passenger auto and homeowners insurance. The Company also offers several other personal property and casualty insurance products, select commercial property and casualty coverages, consumer product protection plans, device and mobile data collection services and analytic solutions using automotive telematics information, roadside assistance, finance and insurance products, employer voluntary benefits and group accident and health insurance and identity protection. Allstate primarily distributes its products through exclusive agents, financial specialists, independent agents and brokers, major retailers, contact centers and the internet.\nRisks and uncertainties\nAllstate has exposure to catastrophic events, including wind and hail, wildfires, tornadoes, hurricanes, tropical storms, earthquakes, severe freeze events, volcanic eruptions, terrorism and industrial accidents.\nCatastrophes, an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business, have contributed, and will continue to contribute, to material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations and financial position (see Note 9). The nature and level of catastrophic loss experienced in any period cannot be predicted and could be material to results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company considers the following categories and locations to be the greatest areas of potential catastrophe losses:\n•\nWildfires — California, Colorado, Oregon, Texas and Arizona\n•\nHurricanes — Major metropolitan centers in counties along the eastern and gulf coasts of the United States\n•\nWind/Hail, Rain and Tornado — Texas, Illinois, Georgia and Colorado\n•\nEarthquakes and fires following earthquakes —Major metropolitan areas near fault lines in the states of California, Oregon, Washington, South Carolina and Kentucky\nThe Novel Coronavirus Pandemic or COVID-19 (“Coronavirus”)\nThe Novel Coronavirus Pandemic or COVID-19 (“Coronavirus\n”)\nresulted in governments worldwide enacting emergency measures to combat the spread of the virus, including travel restrictions, government-imposed shelter-in-place orders, quarantine periods, social distancing, and restrictions on large gatherings. These measures moderated in 2021 as vaccines have become more widely available in the United States and Canada. There is no way of predicting with certainty how long the pandemic might last. We continue to closely monitor and proactively adapt to developments and changing conditions. Currently, it is not possible to reliably estimate the impact to our operations, but the effects have been and could be material.\nThe Allstate Corporation      101\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nInvestments\nFixed income securities include bonds and asset-backed securities (“ABS”). ABS includes mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”) that were previously disclosed separately. Fixed income securities, which may be sold prior to their contractual maturity, are designated as available-for-sale (“AFS”) and are carried at fair value. The difference between amortized cost, net of credit loss allowances (“amortized cost, net”) and fair value, net of deferred income taxes and related life deferred policy acquisition costs (“DAC”), is reflected as a component of AOCI. The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of its AFS fixed income securities. Cash received from calls and make-whole payments is reflected as a component of proceeds from sales and cash received from maturities and pay-downs is reflected as a component of investment collections within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nEquity securities primarily include common stocks, exchange traded and mutual funds, non-redeemable preferred stocks and real estate investment trust equity investments. Certain exchange traded and mutual funds have fixed income securities as their underlying investments. Equity securities are carried at fair value. Equity securities without readily determinable or estimable fair values are measured using the measurement alternative, which is cost less impairment, if any, and adjustments resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or similar investment of the same issuer.\nMortgage loans and bank loans are carried at amortized cost, net, which represent the amount expected to be collected. The Company excludes accrued interest receivable from the amortized cost basis of its mortgage and bank loans. Credit loss allowances are estimates of expected credit losses, established for loans upon origination or purchase, and are established considering all relevant information available, including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts over the life of the loans. Loans are evaluated on a pooled basis when they share similar risk characteristics; otherwise, they are evaluated individually.\nInvestments in limited partnership interests are primarily accounted for in accordance with the equity method of accounting (“EMA”) and include interests in private equity funds, real estate funds and other funds. Investments in limited partnership interests purchased prior to January 1, 2018, where the Company’s interest is so minor that it exercises virtually no influence over operating and financial policies, are accounted for at fair value primarily utilizing the net asset value (“NAV”) as a practical expedient to determine fair value.\nShort-term investments, including money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term investments, are carried at fair value. Other investments primarily consist of bank loans, policy loans, real estate and derivatives. Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans. Policy loans\nare carried at unpaid principal balances. Real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Derivatives are carried at fair value.\nInvestment income primarily consists of interest, dividends, income from limited partnership interests, rental income from real estate, and income from certain derivative transactions. Interest is recognized on an accrual basis using the effective yield method and dividends are recorded at the ex-dividend date. Interest income for ABS is determined considering estimated pay-downs, including prepayments, obtained from third-party data sources and internal estimates. Actual prepayment experience is periodically reviewed, and effective yields are recalculated when differences arise between the prepayments originally anticipated and the actual prepayments received and currently anticipated. For ABS of high credit quality with fixed interest rates, the effective yield is recalculated on a retrospective basis. For all others, the effective yield is generally recalculated on a prospective basis. Net investment income for AFS fixed income securities includes the impact of accreting the credit loss allowance for the time value of money. Accrual of income is suspended for fixed income securities when the timing and amount of cash flows expected to be received is not reasonably estimable. Accrual of income is suspended for mortgage loans and bank loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Accrued income receivable is monitored for recoverability and when not expected to be collected is written off through net investment income. Cash receipts on investments on nonaccrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of amortized cost. Income from limited partnership interests carried at fair value is recognized based upon the changes in fair value of the investee’s equity primarily determined using NAV. Income from EMA limited partnership interests is recognized based on the Company’s share of the partnerships’ earnings. Income from EMA limited partnership interests is generally recognized on a three month delay due to the availability of the related financial statements from investees.\nNet gains and losses on investments and derivatives include gains and losses on investment sales, changes in the credit loss allowances related to fixed income securities, mortgage loans and bank loans, impairments, valuation changes of equity investments, including equity securities and certain limited partnerships where the underlying assets are predominately public equity securities, and periodic changes in fair value and settlements of certain derivatives, including hedge ineffectiveness. Net gains and losses on sales of investments and derivatives are determined on a specific identification basis and are net of credit losses already recognized through an allowance.\n102      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nDerivative and embedded derivative financial instruments\nDerivative financial instruments include interest rate swaps, credit default swaps, futures (interest rate and equity), options (including swaptions), warrants and rights, foreign currency forwards and total return swaps.\nAll derivatives are accounted for on a fair value basis and reported as other investments, other assets, other liabilities and accrued expenses. Embedded derivative instruments subject to bifurcation are also accounted for on a fair value basis and are reported together with the host contract. Cash flows from other derivatives are reported in cash flows from investing activities within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.\nFor derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied, the income statement effects, including fair value gains and losses and accrued periodic settlements, are reported either in net gains and losses on investments and derivatives or in a single line item together with the results of the associated asset or liability for which risks are being managed.\nSecurities loaned\nThe Company’s business activities include securities lending transactions, which are used primarily to generate net investment income. The proceeds received in conjunction with securities lending transactions can be reinvested in short-term investments or fixed income securities. These transactions are short-term in nature, usually\n30\ndays or less.\nThe Company receives cash collateral for securities loaned in an amount generally equal to\n102\n% and\n105\n% of the fair value of domestic and foreign securities, respectively, and records the related obligations to return the collateral in other liabilities and accrued expenses. The carrying value of these obligations approximates fair value because of their relatively short-term nature. The Company monitors the market value of securities loaned on a daily basis and obtains additional collateral as necessary under the terms of the agreements to mitigate counterparty credit risk. The Company maintains the right and ability to repossess the securities loaned on short notice.\nRecognition of premium revenues and contract charges, and related benefits and interest credited\nProperty and casualty insurance premiums include premiums from personal lines policies, protection plans, other contracts (primarily finance and insurance products) and roadside assistance.\nPersonal lines insurance premiums are deferred and earned on a pro-rata basis over the terms of the policies, typically periods of\nsix\nor\ntwelve months\n.\nRevenues related to protection plans, other contracts (primarily finance and insurance products) and roadside assistance are deferred and earned over the term of the contract in a manner that recognizes revenue as obligations under the contracts are performed. Revenues from these products are classified as premiums as the products are backed by insurance. Protection plans and finance and insurance premiums are recognized using a cost-based incurrence method over the term of the contracts, which is generally\none\nto\nfive years\n. Roadside assistance premiums are recognized evenly over the term of the contract as performance obligations are fulfilled.\nThe portion of premiums written applicable to the unexpired terms of the policies is recorded as unearned premiums.\nProtection Services\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recognized $\n1.28\nbillion of property and casualty insurance premiums for Protection Services that were included in the unearned premium balance as of December 31, 2020.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2020, the Company recognized $\n1.11\nbillion of property and casualty insurance premiums for Protection Services that were included in the unearned premium balance as of December 31, 2019.\nThe Company expects to recognize approximately $\n1.48\nbillion, $\n1.07\nbillion and $\n1.50\nbillion of the December 31, 2021 unearned premium balance in 2022, 2023 and thereafter, respectively.\nPremium installment receivables represent premiums written and not yet collected, net of the credit loss allowance for uncollectible premiums. These receivables are primarily outstanding for one year or less. The Company utilizes historical internal data including aging analyses to estimate allowances under current conditions and for the forecast period. The Company regularly evaluates and updates the data and adjusts its allowance as appropriate.\nThe increase in the provision for credit losses primarily related to the acquisition of National General.\nThe Allstate Corporation      103\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nVoluntary accident and health insurance products are expected to remain in force for an extended period and therefore are primarily classified as long-duration contracts. Traditional life insurance products consist principally of products with fixed and guaranteed premiums and benefits, primarily term and whole life insurance products. Premiums from these products are recognized as revenue when due from policyholders, net of any credit loss allowance for uncollectible premiums. Benefits are reflected in accident and health insurance policy benefits and recognized over the life of the policy in relation to premiums.\nInterest-sensitive life contracts, such as universal life, are insurance contracts whose terms are not fixed and guaranteed. The terms that may be changed include premiums paid by the contractholder, interest credited to the contractholder account balance and contract charges assessed against the contractholder account balance. Premiums from these contracts are reported as contractholder fund deposits. Contract charges consist of fees assessed against the contractholder account balance for the cost of insurance (mortality risk), contract administration and surrender of the contract prior to contractually specified dates. These contract charges are recognized as revenue when assessed against the contractholder account balance. Benefit payments in excess of the contractholder account balance are reflected in accident and health insurance policy benefits.\nInterest credited to contractholder funds represents interest accrued or paid on interest-sensitive life contracts. Crediting rates for interest-sensitive life contracts are adjusted periodically by the Company to reflect current market conditions subject to contractually guaranteed minimum rates.\nOther revenue\nOther revenue represents fees collected from policyholders relating to premium installment payments, commissions on sales of non-proprietary products, sales of identity protection services, fee-based services and other revenue transactions. Other revenue is recognized when performance obligations are fulfilled.\nDeferred policy acquisition costs\nCosts that are related directly to the successful acquisition of new or renewal policies or contracts are deferred and recorded as DAC. These costs are principally agent and broker remuneration, premium taxes and certain underwriting expenses. All other acquisition costs are expensed as incurred and included in operating costs and expenses.\nFor property and casualty insurance, DAC is amortized into income as premiums are earned, typically over periods of\nsix\nor\ntwelve months\nfor personal lines policies or generally\none\nto\nfive years\nfor protection plans and other contracts (primarily related to finance and insurance products), and is included in amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs. DAC associated with property and casualty insurance is periodically reviewed for recoverability and adjusted if necessary. Future investment income is considered in determining the recoverability of DAC.\nFor voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life, DAC is amortized over the premium paying period of the related policies in proportion to the estimated revenues on such business.\nAssumptions used in the amortization of DAC and reserve calculations are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not revised during the life of the policy. Any deviations from projected business in force resulting from actual policy terminations differing from expected levels and any estimated premium deficiencies may result in a change to the rate of amortization in the period such events occur. Generally, the amortization periods for these policies approximates the estimated lives of the policies. The Company periodically reviews the recoverability of DAC using actual experience and current assumptions. Voluntary accident and health insurance products and traditional life insurance products are reviewed individually. If actual experience and current assumptions are adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance would be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required for any remaining deficiency.\nFor interest-sensitive life insurance, DAC is amortized in proportion to the incidence of the total present value of gross profits expected to be earned over the estimated lives of the contracts.\nGross profits primarily consist of the following components: contract charges for the cost of insurance less mortality costs and other benefits; investment income and net gains and losses on investments less interest credited; and surrender and other contract charges less maintenance expenses. The principal assumptions for determining the amount of gross profits are mortality, persistency, expenses, investment returns and interest crediting rates to contractholders.\nThe Company performs quarterly reviews of DAC recoverability for interest-sensitive life using actual experience and current assumptions.\n104      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe DAC balance presented includes adjustments to reflect the amount by which the amortization of DAC would increase or decrease if the unrealized capital gains or losses in the respective product investment portfolios were actually realized. The adjustments are recorded net of tax in AOCI. DAC and deferred income taxes determined on unrealized capital gains and losses and reported in AOCI recognize the impact on shareholders’ equity consistently with the amounts that would be recognized in the income statement on net gains and losses on investments and derivatives.\nCustomers of the Company may exchange one insurance policy for another offered by the Company, or make modifications to an existing life, accident and health or property and casualty contract issued by the Company. These transactions are identified as internal replacements for accounting purposes. Internal replacement transactions determined to result in replacement contracts that are substantially unchanged from the replaced contracts are accounted for as continuations of the replaced contracts. Unamortized DAC related to the replaced contracts continue to be deferred and amortized in connection with the replacement contracts. For traditional life, accident and health and property and casualty insurance policies, any changes to unamortized DAC that result from replacement contracts are treated as prospective revisions and any costs associated with the issuance of replacement contracts are characterized as maintenance costs and expensed as incurred.\nThe costs assigned to the right to receive future cash flows from certain business purchased from other insurers are also classified as DAC in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The costs capitalized represent the present value of future profits expected to be earned over the lives of the contracts acquired. These costs are amortized as profits emerge over the lives of the acquired business and are periodically evaluated for recoverability.\nThe present value of future profits was $\n24\nmillion and $\n23\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Amortization expense of the present value of future profits was $\n323\nmillion, $\n14\nmillion and $\n6\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nReinsurance and Indemnification\nReinsurance\nIn the normal course of business, the Company seeks to limit aggregate and single exposure to losses on large risks by purchasing reinsurance. The Company has also used reinsurance to affect the disposition of certain blocks of business. Reinsurance does not extinguish the Company’s primary liability under the policies written. Therefore, in addition to establishing allowances as appropriate after evaluating reinsurers’ activities related to claims settlement practices and commutations, the Company evaluates reinsurer counterparty credit risk and records reinsurance recoverables net of credit loss allowances. The Company assesses counterparty credit risk for individual reinsurers separately when more relevant or on a pooled basis when shared risk characteristics exist. The evaluation considers the credit quality of the reinsurer and the period over which the recoverable\nbalances are expected to be collected. The Company considers factors including past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts in the development of the estimate of credit loss allowances.\nAllowances for property and casualty and accident and health reinsurance recoverables are established primarily through risk-based evaluations.\nThe property and casualty recoverable evaluation considers the credit rating of the reinsurer, the period over which the reinsurance recoverable balances are expected to be recovered and other relevant factors including historical experience of reinsurer failures. Reinsurers in liquidation or in default status are evaluated individually using the Company’s historical liquidation recovery assumptions and any other relevant information available including the most recent public information related to the financial condition or liquidation status of the reinsurer. For accident and health reinsurance recoverables, the Company uses a probability of default and loss given default model developed independently of the Company to estimate current expected credit losses. The accident and health reinsurance recoverable evaluation utilizes factors including historical industry factors based on the probability of liquidation, and incorporates current loss given default factors reflective of the industry.\nThe Company monitors the credit ratings of reinsurer counterparties and evaluates the circumstances surrounding credit rating changes as inputs into its credit loss assessments. Uncollectible reinsurance recoverable balances are written off against the allowances when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery.\nThe changes in the allowances are reported in property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense and accident and health insurance policy benefits.\nIndemnification\nThe Company also participates in various indemnification mechanisms, including industry pools and facilities, which are reimbursement mechanisms that assess participating insurers for expected insured claims, reimburse participating insurers for qualifying paid claims and permit participating insurers to recoup amounts assessed directly from insureds. Indemnification recoverables are backed by the financial resources of the property and casualty insurance company market participants.\nThe amounts reported as indemnification recoverables include amounts paid and due from indemnitors as well as estimates of amounts expected to be recovered from indemnitors on insurance liabilities that have been incurred but not yet paid. The design and function of these indemnification programs does not result in the retention of insurance or reinsurance risk by the indemnitor. Based on the Company’s evaluation of these programs on an individual basis, the establishment of credit loss allowances is not warranted at this time. The Company has not experienced any historical credit losses related to its indemnification programs. The Company\nThe Allstate Corporation      105\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\ncontinues to monitor these programs to determine whether any changes from historical experience have emerged or are expected to emerge or whether there have been any changes in the design or administration of the programs that would require establishment of credit loss allowances.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill represents the excess of amounts paid for acquiring businesses over the fair value of the net assets acquired, less any impairment of goodwill recognized.\nThe Company’s goodwill reporting units are equivalent to its reportable segments, Allstate Protection, Protection Services, and Allstate Health and Benefits to which goodwill has been assigned.\nGoodwill is recognized when acquired and allocated to reporting units based on which unit is expected to benefit from the synergies of the business combination. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment at least annually. The Company performs its annual goodwill impairment testing during the fourth quarter of each year based upon data as of the close of the third quarter. Goodwill impairment is measured and recognized as the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value, including goodwill, exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit. The Company also reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances, such as deteriorating or adverse market conditions, indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill may exceed the fair value of the reporting unit. The goodwill impairment analysis is performed at the reporting unit level.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of the Company’s goodwill reporting units exceeded their carrying values.\nAs disclosed in Note 3, the Company completed the sales of Allstate Life Insurance Company (“ALIC”) and certain affiliates and Allstate Life Insurance Company of New York (“ALNY”) involving business in both the Allstate Life and Allstate Annuities segments. As a result of these transactions, the Company’s goodwill was reduced by $\n175\nmillion in 2021.\nIntangible assets\nIntangible assets (reported in other assets) consist of capitalized costs primarily related to acquired customer relationships, trade names and licenses, technology and other assets. The estimated useful lives of customer relationships, technology and other intangible assets are generally\n10\nyears,\n5\nyears and\n7\nyears, respectively. Intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is calculated using an accelerated amortization method.\nAmortization expense on intangible assets was $\n376\nmillion, $\n118\nmillion and $\n126\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAccumulated amortization of intangible assets was $\n1.13\nbillion and $\n751\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nTrade names and licenses are considered to have an indefinite useful life and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequent if circumstances arise that indicate an impairment may have occurred. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nDuring second quarter 2019, the Company made the decision to phase-out the use of the SquareTrade trade name in the United States and sell consumer protection plans under the Allstate Protection Plans name. The SquareTrade trade name will continue to be used outside of the United States. The change required an impairment evaluation of the indefinite-lived intangible asset recognized in the Protection Services segment for SquareTrade’s trade name recorded when SquareTrade was acquired in 2017.\nDuring fourth quarter 2019, the Company made the decision to integrate Esurance into the Allstate brand as part of Transformative Growth. This required an impairment evaluation of the indefinite-lived intangible asset recognized in the Allstate Protection segment for the Esurance trade name recorded when Esurance was acquired in 2011.\nAs a result of these actions, the Company recognized total impairment charges of $\n106\nmillion pre-tax during 2019.\n106      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nProperty and equipment\nProperty and equipment is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Included in property and equipment are capitalized costs related to computer software licenses and software developed for internal use. These costs generally consist of certain external payroll and payroll related costs. Property and equipment depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, generally\n3\nto\n10\nyears for equipment and\n40\nyears for real property. Depreciation expense is reported in operating costs and expenses. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment was $\n2.44\nbillion and $\n2.81\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Depreciation expense on property and equipment was $\n411\nmillion, $\n353\nmillion and $\n326\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The Company reviews its property and equipment for impairment at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\nIncome taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for using the asset and liability method under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. The principal assets and liabilities giving rise to such differences are DAC, unearned premiums, investments (including unrealized capital gains and losses), intangible assets and insurance reserves. A deferred tax asset valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not such assets will not be realized. The Company recognizes interest expense related to income tax matters in income tax expense and penalties in other expense.\nReserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense\nThe reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense is the estimate of amounts necessary to settle all reported and unreported incurred claims for the ultimate cost of insured property and casualty losses, based upon the facts of each case and the Company’s experience with similar cases. Estimated amounts of salvage and subrogation are deducted from the reserve for claims and claims expense. The establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophe losses, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. Reserve estimates are primarily derived using an actuarial estimation process in which historical loss patterns are applied to actual paid losses and reported losses (paid losses plus individual case reserves established by claim adjusters) for an accident or report year to create an estimate of how losses are likely to develop over time. Development factors are calculated quarterly and periodically throughout the year for data elements such as claims reported and settled, paid losses, and paid losses combined with case reserves. The historical development patterns for these data elements are used as the assumptions to calculate reserve estimates, including the reserves for reported and\nunreported claims. Reserve estimates are regularly reviewed and updated, using the most current information available. Any resulting reestimates are reflected in current results of operations.\nReserve for future policy benefits\nThe reserve for future policy benefits payable under insurance policies, including voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance products, is computed on the basis of long-term actuarial assumptions of future investment yields, mortality, morbidity, policy terminations and expenses. These assumptions include provisions for adverse deviation and generally vary by characteristics such as type of coverage, year of issue and policy duration. The assumptions are established at the time the policy is issued and are generally not changed during the life of the policy. The Company periodically reviews the adequacy of reserves using actual experience and current assumptions. If actual experience and current assumptions are adverse compared to the original assumptions and a premium deficiency is determined to exist, any remaining unamortized DAC balance would be expensed to the extent not recoverable and the establishment of a premium deficiency reserve may be required for any remaining deficiency. Voluntary accident and health insurance and traditional life insurance products are reviewed individually. The Company also reviews these policies for circumstances where projected profits would be recognized in early years followed by projected losses in later years. If this circumstance exists, the Company will accrue a liability, during the period of profits, to offset the losses at such time as the future losses are expected to commence using a method updated prospectively over time.\nAccident and health short duration contracts\nThe reserve for future policy benefits includes unpaid losses and loss adjustment expense (“LAE”) reserves for individual and certain voluntary accident and health short-duration contracts and is an estimate of the Company’s liability from incurred claims at the end of the reporting period. The unpaid losses and LAE reserves are the result of an ongoing analysis of recent loss development trends and emerging historical experience. Original estimates are increased or decreased as additional information becomes known regarding individual claims. In setting its reserves, the Company reviews its loss data to estimate expected loss development. Management believes that its use of standard actuarial methodology applied to its analyses of its historical experience provides a reasonable estimate of future losses. However, actual future losses may differ from the Company’s estimate, and may be affected by future events beyond the control of management, including inflation, which may favorably or unfavorably impact the ultimate settlement of the Company’s losses and LAE, as well as changes in the law and judicial interpretations.\nThe anticipated effect of inflation is implicitly considered when estimating liabilities for losses and LAE. In addition to inflation, the average severity of claims is affected by a number of factors that may vary by types and features of policies written. Future average severities are projected from historical trends,\nThe Allstate Corporation      107\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nadjusted for implemented changes in underwriting standards and policy provisions, as well as general economic trends. These estimated trends are monitored and revised as necessary based on actual development.\nUnpaid losses include a provision for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) reserve estimates representing claims that have occurred but have not yet been reported, some of which are not yet known to the insured, as well as a provision for future development on reported claims. IBNR reserves are generally calculated by first projecting the ultimate cost of all claims that have occurred and then subtracting reported losses and loss expenses. Reported losses include cumulative paid losses and loss expenses plus case reserves.\nThe Company’s accident and health claims are counted by claim number assigned to each claimant per illness, injury or death, regardless of number of services rendered for each incident. Claims closed without payment are not included in the cumulative number of reported accident and health claims.\nContractholder funds\nContractholder funds represent interest-bearing liabilities arising from the sale of interest-sensitive life insurance contracts. Contractholder funds primarily comprise cumulative deposits received and interest credited to the contractholder less cumulative contract benefits, surrenders, withdrawals and contract charges for mortality or administrative expenses. Contractholder funds also include reserves for secondary guarantees on interest-sensitive life insurance.\nPension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses\nPension and other postretirement gains and losses represent the remeasurement of projected benefit obligation and plan assets, which are immediately recognized in earnings and are referred to as pension and other postretirement remeasurement gains and losses on the Consolidated Statements of Operations. The Company’s policy is to remeasure its pension and postretirement plans on a quarterly basis.\nDifferences between expected and actual returns and changes in assumptions affect our pension and other postretirement obligations, plan assets and expenses.\nThe primary factors contributing to pension and postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are:\nPension and other postretirement service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets and amortization of prior service credits are allocated to the Company’s reportable segments. The pension and\nother postretirement remeasurement gains and losses are reported in the Corporate and Other segment.\nLegal contingencies\nThe Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management’s best estimate when the Company assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals. The Company does not include potential recoveries in its estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nLong-term debt\nLong-term debt includes senior notes, senior debentures, subordinated debentures and junior subordinated debentures issued by the Corporation. Unamortized debt issuance costs and fair value adjustments are reported in long-term debt and are amortized over the expected period the debt will remain outstanding.\nEquity incentive plans\nThe Company has equity incentive plans under which it grants nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock awards (“equity awards”) to certain employees and directors of the Company. The Company measures the fair value of equity awards at the grant date and recognizes the expense over the shorter of the period in which the requisite service is rendered or retirement eligibility is attained. The expense for performance stock awards with no market condition is adjusted each period to reflect the performance factor most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. The expense for performance stock awards with a market condition is based on the fair value of the awards at the grant date which incorporates the probability of achieving the market condition. In the event the market condition is not met, any previously recognized expense is not reversed. The Company uses a binomial lattice model to determine the fair value of employee stock options. The Company uses a Monte Carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of performance stock awards with market condition.\nMeasurement of credit losses\nThe Company carries an allowance for expected credit losses for all financial assets measured at amortized cost on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company considers past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts in estimating an allowance for credit losses. The Company also carries a credit loss allowance for fixed income securities where applicable and, when amortized cost is reported, it is net of credit loss allowances. For additional information, refer to the Investments, Reinsurance, Indemnification or Recognition of premium revenues and contract charges, topics of this section.\n108      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe Company also estimates a credit loss allowance for commitments to fund mortgage loans and bank loans unless they are unconditionally\ncancellable by the Company. The related allowance is reported in other liabilities and accrued expenses.\n(1)\nIncludes credit loss allowance for investments that are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020.\nLeases\nThe Company has certain operating leases for office facilities, computer and office equipment, and vehicles. The Company’s leases have remaining lease terms of generally\n1\nyear to\n9\nyears, some of which include options to extend the leases for up to\n20\nyears, and some of which include options to terminate the leases within\n32\ndays.\nThe Company determines if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Leases with an initial term less than one year are not recorded on the balance sheet and the lease costs for these leases are recorded as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Operating leases with terms greater than one year result in a lease liability recorded in\nother liabilities\nwith a corresponding right-of-use (“ROU”) asset recorded in\nother assets\n. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had $\n465\nmillion and $\n511\nmillion in lease liabilities and $\n314\nmillion and $\n393\nmillion in ROU assets, respectively.\nOperating lease liabilities are recognized at the commencement date based on the present value of future minimum lease payments over the lease term. ROU assets are recognized based on the corresponding lease liabilities adjusted for qualifying initial direct costs, prepaid or accrued lease payments and unamortized lease incentives. As most of the Company’s leases do not disclose the implicit interest rate, the Company uses collateralized incremental borrowing rates based on information available at lease commencement when determining the present value of future lease payments. The Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease. Lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease which are incorporated into the Company’s measurements when it is reasonably certain that the Company will exercise the option.\nOperating lease costs are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term and include interest expense on the lease liability and amortization\nof the ROU asset. Variable lease costs are expensed as incurred and include maintenance costs and real estate taxes.\nLease costs are reported in operating costs and expenses and totaled $\n162\nmillion and\n$\n166\nmillion, including $\n30\nmillion and $\n30\nmillion of variable lease costs in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nConsolidation of variable interest entities (“VIEs”)\nA VIE is a legal entity that does not have sufficient equity at risk to finance its activities without additional financial support or is structured such that equity investors lack the ability to make significant decisions relating to the entity’s operations through voting rights or do not participate in the gains and losses of the entity. The Company consolidates VIEs in which the Company is deemed the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary is the entity that has both (1) the obligation to absorb losses or the right to receive benefits that could potentially be significant to the VIE and (2) the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly affect that entity’s economic performance.\nThe Allstate Corporation      109\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nDiscontinued Operations and Held for Sale\nA business is classified as held for sale when management having the authority to approve the action commits to a plan to sell the business, the sale is probable to occur during the next 12 months at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and certain other criteria are met. A business classified as held for sale is recorded at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less cost to sell. When the carrying amount of the business exceeds its estimated fair value less cost to sell, a loss is recognized and updated each reporting period as appropriate.\nThe results of operations of business classified as held for sale are reported as discontinued operations if the disposal represents a strategic shift that will have a major effect on the entity’s operations and financial results. The disposal of a reportable segment generally qualifies for discontinued operations presentation.\nWhen a business is identified for discontinued operations reporting:\n•\nResults for prior periods are retrospectively reclassified as discontinued operations\n•\nResults of operations are reported in a single line, net of tax, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations\n•\nAssets and liabilities are reported as held for sale in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position in the period in which the business is classified as held for sale\nAdditional details by major classification of operating results and financial position are included in Note 3.\nForeign currency translation\nThe local currency of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries is deemed to be the functional currency of the country in which these subsidiaries operate. The financial statements of the Company’s foreign subsidiaries are translated into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate in effect at the end of a reporting period for assets and liabilities and at average exchange rates during the period for results of operations.\nThe unrealized gains and losses from the translation of the net assets are recorded as unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments and included in AOCI. Changes in unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments are included in OCI. Gains and losses from foreign currency transactions are reported in operating costs and expenses and have not been material.\nEarnings per common share\nBasic earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding, including vested unissued participating restricted stock units. Diluted earnings per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common and dilutive potential common shares outstanding.\nFor the Company, dilutive potential common shares consist of outstanding stock options and unvested non-participating restricted stock units and contingently issuable performance stock awards. The effect of dilutive potential common shares does not include options with an anti-dilutive effect on earnings per common share because their exercise prices exceed the average market price of Allstate common shares during the period or for which the unrecognized compensation cost would have an anti-dilutive effect.\n110      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nAdopted accounting standards\nSimplifications to the Accounting for Income Taxes\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted new Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) guidance which simplified the accounting for income taxes by eliminating certain exceptions and clarifying certain guidance. The adoption had an immaterial impact on the Company’s results of operations and financial position.\nChanges to the Disclosure Requirements for Defined Benefit Plans\nEffective January 1, 2021, the Company adopted new FASB guidance to modify certain annual disclosure requirements for defined benefit plans. New disclosures include explanations for significant gains and losses related to changes in the benefit obligation during the reporting period, as well as the weighted-average interest crediting rate assumptions used to determine the benefit obligation and net benefit cost for cash balance plans and other plans with interest crediting rates. Disclosures to be eliminated include amounts expected to be reclassified out of AOCI and into the income statement in the coming year and the anticipated impact of a one-percentage point change in the assumed health care cost trend rate on service and interest cost and on the accumulated benefit obligation. The impacts of adoption are to the Company’s annual disclosures only.\nThe Allstate Corporation      111\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nPending accounting standard\nAccounting for Long-Duration Insurance Contracts\nIn August 2018, the FASB issued guidance revising the accounting for certain long-duration insurance contracts. As disclosed in Note 3, the Company sold substantially all of its life and annuity business in scope of the new standard. The Company’s reserves and deferred policy acquisition costs for certain voluntary and individual life and accident and health insurance products are subject to the new guidance.\nUnder the new guidance, measurement assumptions, including those for mortality, morbidity and policy terminations, will be required to be reviewed at least annually, and updated as appropriate. The effect of updating assumptions other than the discount rate are required to be measured on a retrospective basis and reported in net income. In addition, reserves under the new guidance are required to be discounted using an upper-medium grade fixed income instrument yield that is updated through OCI at each reporting date. Current GAAP requires the measurement of reserves to utilize assumptions set at policy issuance unless updated current assumptions indicate that recorded reserves are deficient.\nThe new guidance also requires DAC and other capitalized balances currently amortized in proportion to premiums or gross profits to be amortized on a constant level basis over the expected term for all long-duration insurance contracts. DAC will not be subject to loss recognition testing but will be reduced when actual lapse experience exceeds expected experience.\nThe new guidance is effective for financial statements issued for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2022 and restatement of prior periods presented is required. The new guidance will be applied to affected contracts and DAC on the basis of existing carrying amounts at the earliest period presented.\nThe Company is evaluating the anticipated impacts of applying the new guidance to both retained income and AOCI and does not anticipate the financial statement impact of adopting the new guidance to be material to the Company’s results of operations or financial position due to the dispositions of ALIC, ALNY and certain affiliates.\n112      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nAcquisitions\nNational General\nOn January 4, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. (“National General”), an insurance holding company serving customers predominantly through independent agents for property and casualty and accident and health products.\nNational General provides personal and commercial automobile, homeowners, umbrella, recreational vehicle, motorcycle, lender-placed, health and other niche insurance products. This acquisition increased the Company’s market share in personal property-liability and enhance its independent agent distribution platform.\n(1)\nThe amounts reflect allocation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed.\n(2)\n$\n675\nmillion, $\n20\nmillion and $\n343\nmillion of goodwill were allocated to the Allstate Protection, Protection Services and Allstate Health and Benefits segments, respectively, and is non-deductible for income tax purposes. Goodwill is primarily attributable to expected synergies and future growth opportunities.\n(3)\nSubsequent to the acquisition, the Company repaid $\n100\nmillion of\n7.625\n% Subordinated Notes and $\n72\nmillion of Subordinated Debentures on February 3, 2021 and March 15, 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, the Company had principal balance remaining of $\n350\nmillion\n6.750\n% Senior Notes due 2024, with a fair value adjustment of $\n45\nmillion.\nIntangible assets (reported in other assets in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position) consist of capitalized costs, primarily of the estimated fair value of distribution and customer relationships, trade names, licenses and technology assets. The estimated useful lives of these assets generally range from\n3\nto\n10\nyears.\nThe estimated fair value of distribution and customer relationship intangible assets was determined using an income approach that considered cash flows and profits expected to be generated by the\nacquired relationships, a weighted-average cost of capital discount rate reflecting the relative risk of achieving the anticipated cash flows, profits, the time value of money, and other relevant inputs. Technology and trade names were valued using estimated useful lives and market licensing rates discounted at a weighted-average cost of capital. Licenses are primarily insurance licenses which were valued using the median value of market transactions executed over an extended observation period.\nLicenses are considered to have an indefinite useful life and are reviewed for impairment at least annually or more frequently if circumstances arise that indicate an impairment may have occurred. An impairment is recognized if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value.\nThe Allstate Corporation      113\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIntangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortization. Amortization expense is primarily calculated using accelerated amortization methods. Amortization expense on intangible assets was $\n251\nmillion in 2021.\nValue of business acquired\n(reported in DAC in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position) recognized in connection with the acquisition of National General represents the value of future profits expected to be earned over the lives of the contracts acquired determined using a weighted-average cost of capital discount and other relevant assumptions. These costs are amortized over the policy term of the contracts in force at the acquisition date, generally over\nsix\nor\ntwelve months\n. The value of business acquired asset recognized in connection with the National General acquisition totaled $\n317\nmillion, all of which was expensed in 2021. The most significant portion relates to insurance contracts in the Allstate Protection segment.\nOther fair value adjustments included an increase in reserves of $\n62\nmillion, a $\n9\nmillion reduction to investments that were not held at fair value, and a net increase in current and deferred tax liabilities of $\n153\nmillion.\nPreferred stock\nOn February 2, 2021,\nsubsequent to the acquisition, the Company redeemed all outstanding shares of\n7.50\n% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series A, par value $\n0.01\nper share, all outstanding Depositary shares, representing 1/40th of a Share of\n7.50\n% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, and the underlying shares of\n7.50\n% Non-Cumulative Preferred Stock, Series B, par value $\n0.01\nper share, and all outstanding shares of Fixed/Floating Rate Non-Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, Series D, par value $\n0.01\nper share for a total redemption payment of $\n250\nmillion.\nOn July 15, 2021, the Company redeemed all outstanding Depositary shares, representing 1/40th of a share of National General’s\n7.50\n% Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, and the underlying shares of\n7.50\n% Noncumulative Preferred Stock, Series C, par value $\n0.01\nper share for a total redemption payment of $\n200\nmillion.\nTransactions costs\n(reported in operating costs and expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Operations) of $\n22\nmillion related to the acquisition were expensed as incurred in the Corporate and Other segment.\nSafeAuto\nOn June 1, 2021, the Company announced an agreement to acquire Safe Auto Insurance Group, Inc. (“SafeAuto”), a non-standard auto insurance carrier focused on providing state-minimum private-passenger auto insurance with coverage options in\n28\nstates. On October 1, 2021, the Company completed the acquisition of SafeAuto for $\n262\nmillion in cash. Starting in the fourth quarter of 2021, the Allstate Protection segment includes SafeAuto.\nIn connection with the acquisition, the Company recorded goodwill of $\n79\nmillion, intangible assets of $\n30\nmillion and value of business acquired of $\n7\nmillion.

These segments are described below and align with the Company’s key product and service offerings.\nAllstate Protection\nprincipally offers private passenger auto and homeowners insurance in the United States and Canada, with earned premiums accounting for\n80.0\n% of Allstate’s 2021 consolidated revenues. Allstate Protection primarily operates in the U.S. (all\n50\nstates and the District of Columbia (“D.C.”)) and Canada. For 2021, the top U.S. geographic locations for premiums earned by the Allstate Protection segment were Texas, California, New York and Florida. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than\n5\n% of premium earned for Allstate Protection. Revenues from external customers generated outside the United States were $\n1.86\nbillion, $\n1.57\nbillion and $\n1.37\nbillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRun-off Property-Liability\nincludes property and casualty insurance coverage that primarily relates to policies written during the 1960s through the mid-1980s. Our exposure to asbestos, environmental and other run-off lines claims arises principally from direct excess commercial insurance, assumed reinsurance coverage, direct primary commercial insurance and other businesses in run-off.\nProtection Services\ncomprise Allstate Protection Plans, Allstate Dealer Services, Allstate Roadside, Arity and Allstate Identity Protection. Protection Services offer consumer product protection plans, finance and insurance products (including vehicle service contracts, guaranteed asset protection waivers, road hazard tire and wheel and paintless dent repair protection), roadside assistance, device and mobile data collection services and analytic solutions using automotive telematics information and identity protection. Protection Services primarily operate in the U.S. and Canada, with Allstate Protection Plans also offering services in Europe, Australia and Asia. Revenues from external customers generated outside the United States relate to consumer product protection plans sold primarily in the European Union and were $\n232\nmillion, $\n188\nmillion and $\n95\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nAllstate Health and Benefits\noffers employer voluntary benefits, group health and individual health products, including life, accident, critical illness, hospital, short-term disability and other health products. Allstate Health and Benefits primarily operates in the U.S. (all\n50\nstates and D.C.) and Canada. For 2021, the top geographic locations for statutory direct accident and health insurance premiums were Florida, Texas, Georgia, Ohio and North Carolina. No other jurisdiction accounted for more than\n5\n% of statutory direct accident and health insurance premiums. Revenues from external customers generated outside the United States relate to voluntary accident and health insurance sold in Canada and were not material.\nCorporate and Other\ncomprises holding company activities and certain non-insurance operations, including expenses associated with strategic initiatives.\nNational General results are included in the following segments:\n•\nProperty and casualty - Allstate Protection\n•\nAccident and health - Allstate Health and Benefits\n•\nTechnology solutions - Protection Services\nAllstate Protection and Run-off Property Liability segments comprise Property-Liability. The Company does not allocate investment income, net gains and losses on investments and derivatives, or assets to the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property Liability segments. Management reviews assets at the Property-Liability, Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits, and Corporate and Other levels for decision-making purposes.\nThe accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as those described in Note 2. The effects of intersegment transactions are eliminated in the consolidated results. For segment results, services provided by Protection Services to Allstate Protection are not eliminated as management considers those transactions in assessing the results of the respective segments.\n116      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nMeasuring segment profit or loss\nThe measure of segment profit or loss used in evaluating performance is underwriting income for the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability and adjusted net income for the Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other segments.\nUnderwriting income\nis calculated as premiums earned and other revenue, less claims and claims expenses (“losses”), Shelter-in-Place Payback expense, amortization of DAC, operating costs and expenses, amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles and restructuring and related charges as determined using GAAP.\nAdjusted net income\nis net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders, excluding:\nA reconciliation of these measures to net income (loss) applicable to common shareholders is provided below.\n(1)\nExcludes amortization or impairment of purchased intangibles in Property-Liability, which is included above in underwriting income.\n(2)\nReflects net loss attributable to noncontrolling interest in Property-Liability.\nThe Allstate Corporation      117\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nIntersegment insurance premiums and service fees are primarily related to Arity and Allstate Roadside and are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements.\n118      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nInterest expense is primarily incurred in the Corporate and Other segment. Capital expenditures for long-lived assets are generally made in Property-Liability as the Company does not allocate assets to the Allstate Protection and Run-off Property-Liability segments. A portion of these long-lived assets are used by entities included in the Protection Services, Allstate Health and Benefits and Corporate and Other segments and, accordingly, are charged to expenses in proportion to their use.\n(1)\nThe balances reflect the elimination of related party investments between segments.\nThe Allstate Corporation      119\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nActual maturities may differ from those scheduled as a result of calls and make-whole payments by the issuers.

Fair value and gross unrealized gains and losses are not applicable.\n(2)\nThe insurance reserves adjustment represents the amount by which the reserve balance would increase if the net unrealized gains in the applicable product portfolios were realized and reinvested at lower interest rates, resulting in a premium deficiency. This adjustment primarily relates to structured settlement annuities with life contingencies (a type of immediate fixed annuity), classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020.\n(3)\nThe DAC and DSI adjustment balance represents the amount by which the amortization of DAC and DSI would increase or decrease if the unrealized gains or losses in the respective product portfolios were realized. This adjustment relates primarily to life insurance products, which are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020.\n122      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nMortgage loans\nThe Company’s mortgage loans are commercial mortgage loans collateralized by a variety of commercial real estate property types located across the United States and totaled $\n821\nmillion and $\n746\nmillion, net of credit loss allowance, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Substantially all of the commercial mortgage loans are non-recourse to the borrower.\nLimited partnerships\nInvestments in limited partnership interests include interests in private equity funds, real estate funds and other funds. Principal factors influencing carrying value appreciation or decline include operating performance, comparable public company earnings multiples, capitalization rates and the economic environment. For equity method limited partnerships, the Company recognizes an impairment loss when evidence demonstrates that the loss is other than temporary. Evidence of a loss in value that is other than temporary may include the absence of an ability to recover the carrying amount of the investment or the inability of the investee to sustain a level of earnings that would justify the carrying amount of the investment. Changes in fair value limited partnerships are recorded through net investment income and therefore are not tested for impairment.\n(1)\nOther consists of certain limited partnership interests where the underlying assets are predominately public equity and debt securities.\n(2)\nCarrying value for limited partnership interests as of December 31, 2021, includes certain investments classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, and transferred to continuing operations in the first and second quarter of 2021, respectively.\nThe Allstate Corporation      123\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMunicipal bonds\nThe Company maintains a diversified portfolio of municipal bonds, including tax exempt and taxable securities, which totaled $\n6.39\nbillion and $\n7.58\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe municipal bond portfolio includes general obligations of state and local issuers and revenue bonds (including pre-refunded bonds, which are bonds for which an irrevocable trust has been established to fund the remaining payments of principal and interest).\nShort-term investments\nShort-term investments, including money market funds, commercial paper, U.S. Treasury bills and other short-term investments, are carried at fair value. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of short-term investments totaled $\n4.01\nbillion and $\n6.81\nbillion, respectively.\nOther investments\nOther investments primarily consist of bank loans, real estate, policy loans and derivatives. Bank loans are primarily senior secured corporate loans and are carried at amortized cost, net. Policy loans are carried at unpaid principal balances. Real estate is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation. Derivatives are carried at fair value.\n(1)\nOther investments as of December 31, 2021 include certain real estate and other investments classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020 and transferred to continuing operations in the first quarter of 2021.\nAgent loans\nwere\nloans issued to exclusive Allstate agents and were carried at amortized cost, net. On November 15, 2021, the Company sold its portfolio of agent loans which were previously reported in other investments. Agent loans were assets of the Allstate Life segment and classified as assets held for sale as of December 31, 2020.\nConcentration of credit risk\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company is not exposed to any credit concentration risk of a single issuer and its affiliates greater than\n10\n% of the Company’s shareholders’ equity, other than the U.S. government and its agencies.\nSecurities loaned\nThe Company’s business activities include securities lending programs with third parties, mostly large banks. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, fixed income and equity securities with a carrying value of $\n1.38\nbillion and $\n872\nmillion, respectively, were on loan under these agreements. Interest income on collateral, net of fees, was $\n1\nmillion, $\n2\nmillion and $\n3\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nOther investment information\nIncluded in fixed income securities are below investment grade assets totaling $\n7.50\nbillion and $\n6.06\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, fixed income securities and short-term investments with a carrying value of $\n211\nmillion were on deposit with regulatory authorities as required by law.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the carrying value of fixed income securities and other investments that were non-income producing was $\n57\nmillion.\n124      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nPortfolio monitoring and credit losses\nFixed income securities\nThe Company has a comprehensive portfolio monitoring process to identify and evaluate each fixed income security that may require a credit loss allowance.\nFor each fixed income security in an unrealized loss position, the Company assesses whether management with the appropriate authority has made the decision to sell or whether it is more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the security before recovery of the amortized cost basis for reasons such as liquidity, contractual or regulatory purposes. If a security meets either of these criteria, any existing credit loss allowance would be written-off against the amortized cost basis of the asset along with any remaining unrealized losses, with incremental losses recorded in earnings.\nIf the Company has not made the decision to sell the fixed income security and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell the fixed income security before recovery of its amortized cost basis, the Company evaluates whether it expects to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the security. The Company calculates the estimated recovery value based on the best estimate of future cash flows considering past events, current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts. The estimated future cash flows are discounted at the security’s current effective rate and is compared to the amortized cost of the security.\nThe determination of cash flow estimates is inherently subjective, and methodologies may vary depending on facts and circumstances specific to the security. All reasonably available information relevant to the collectability of the security is considered when developing the estimate of cash flows expected to be collected. That information generally includes, but is not limited to, the remaining payment terms of the security, prepayment speeds, the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer, expected defaults, expected recoveries, the value of underlying collateral, origination vintage year, geographic concentration of underlying collateral, available reserves or escrows, current subordination levels, third-party guarantees and other credit enhancements. Other information, such as industry analyst reports and forecasts, credit ratings, financial condition of the bond insurer for insured fixed income securities, and other market data relevant to the realizability of contractual cash flows, may also be considered. The estimated fair value of collateral will be used to estimate recovery value if the Company determines that the security is dependent on the liquidation of collateral for ultimate settlement.\nIf the Company does not expect to receive cash flows sufficient to recover the entire amortized cost basis of the fixed income security, a credit loss allowance is recorded in earnings for the shortfall in expected cash flows; however, the amortized cost, net of the credit loss allowance, may not be lower than the fair value of the security. The portion of the unrealized loss related to factors other than credit remains classified in AOCI. If the Company determines that the fixed income security does not have sufficient cash flow or other information to estimate a recovery value for the security, the Company may conclude that the entire decline in fair value is deemed to be credit related and the loss is recorded in earnings.\nWhen a security is sold or otherwise disposed or when the security is deemed uncollectible and written off, the Company removes amounts previously recognized in the credit loss allowance. Recoveries after write-offs are recognized when received. Accrued interest excluded from the amortized cost of fixed income securities totaled $\n311\nmillion and $\n351\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, and 2020, respectively, and is reported within the accrued investment income line of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position. The Company monitors accrued interest and writes off amounts when they are not expected to be received.\nThe Company’s portfolio monitoring process includes a quarterly review of all securities to identify instances where the fair value of a security compared to its amortized cost is below internally established thresholds. The process also includes the monitoring of other credit loss indicators such as ratings, ratings downgrades and payment defaults. The securities identified, in addition to other securities for which the Company may have a concern, are evaluated for potential credit losses using all reasonably available information relevant to the collectability or recovery of the security. Inherent in the Company’s evaluation of credit losses for these securities are assumptions and estimates about the financial condition and future earnings potential of the issue or issuer. Some of the factors that may be considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value requires a credit loss allowance are: 1) the financial condition, near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer, including relevant industry specific market conditions and trends, geographic location and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices; 2) the specific reasons that a security is in an unrealized loss position, including overall market conditions which could affect liquidity; and 3) the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost.\nThe Allstate Corporation      125\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nAllowance for fixed income securities as of December 31, 2021 comprised $\n6\nmillion of corporate bonds. Allowance for fixed income securities as of December 31, 2020 comprised $\n1\nmillion and $\n1\nmillion of corporate bonds and ABS, respectively.\n(1)\nBelow investment grade fixed income securities include $\n33\nmillion that have been in an unrealized loss position for less than twelve months.\n(2)\nRelated to securities with an unrealized loss position less than 20% of amortized cost, net, the degree of which suggests that these securities do not pose a high risk of having credit losses.\n(3)\nNo\nbelow investment grade fixed income securities have been in an unrealized loss position for a period of twelve or more consecutive months.\n(4)\nEvaluated based on factors such as discounted cash flows and the financial condition and near-term and long-term prospects of the issue or issuer and were determined to have adequate resources to fulfill contractual obligations.\n126      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nInvestment grade is defined as a security having a rating of Aaa, Aa, A or Baa from Moody’s, a rating of AAA, AA, A or BBB from S&P Global Ratings (“S&P”), a comparable rating from another nationally recognized rating agency, or a comparable internal rating if an externally provided rating is not available. Market prices for certain securities may have credit spreads which imply higher or lower credit quality than the current third-party rating. Unrealized losses on investment grade securities are principally related to an increase in market yields which may include increased risk-free interest rates or wider credit spreads since the time of initial purchase. The unrealized losses are expected to reverse as the securities approach maturity.\nABS in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on actual and projected collateral losses relative to the securities’ positions in the respective securitization trusts, security specific expectations of cash flows, and credit ratings. This evaluation also takes into consideration credit enhancement, measured in terms of (i) subordination from other classes of securities in the trust that are contractually obligated to absorb losses before the class of security the Company owns, and (ii) the expected impact of other structural features embedded in the securitization trust beneficial to the class of securities the Company owns, such as overcollateralization and excess spread. Municipal bonds in an unrealized loss position were evaluated based on the underlying credit quality of the primary obligor, obligation type and quality of the underlying assets.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has not made the decision to sell and it is not more likely than not the Company will be required to sell fixed income securities with unrealized losses before recovery of the amortized cost basis.\nLoans\nThe Company establishes a credit loss allowance for mortgage loans and bank loans when they are originated or purchased, and for unfunded commitments unless they are unconditionally cancellable by the Company. The Company uses a probability of default and loss given default model for mortgage loans and bank loans to estimate current expected credit losses that considers all relevant information available including past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts over the life of an asset. The Company also considers such factors as historical losses, expected prepayments and various economic factors. For mortgage loans the Company considers origination vintage year and property level information such as debt service coverage, property type, property location and collateral value. For bank loans the Company considers the credit rating of the borrower, credit spreads and type of loan. After the reasonable and supportable forecast period, the Company’s model reverts to historical loss trends.\nLoans are evaluated on a pooled basis when they share similar risk characteristics. The Company\nmonitors loans through a quarterly credit monitoring process to determine when they no longer share similar risk characteristics and are to be evaluated individually when estimating credit losses.\nLoans are written off against their corresponding allowances when there is no reasonable expectation of recovery. If a loan recovers after a write-off, the estimate of expected credit losses includes the expected recovery.\nAccrual of income is suspended for loans that are in default or when full and timely collection of principal and interest payments is not probable. Accrued income receivable is monitored for recoverability and when not expected to be collected is written off through net investment income. Cash receipts on loans on non-accrual status are generally recorded as a reduction of amortized cost.\nAccrued interest is excluded from the amortized cost of loans and is reported within the accrued investment income line of the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nMortgage loans\nWhen it is determined a mortgage loan shall be evaluated individually, the Company uses various methods to estimate credit losses on individual loans such as using collateral value less estimated costs to sell where applicable, including when foreclosure is probable or when repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of the collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty. When collateral value is used, the mortgage loans may not have a credit loss allowance when the fair value of the collateral exceeds the loan’s amortized cost. An alternative approach may be utilized to estimate credit losses using the present value of the loan’s expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan’s current effective interest rate.\nIndividual loan credit loss allowances are adjusted for subsequent changes in the fair value of the collateral less costs to sell, when applicable, or present value of the loan’s expected future repayment cash flows.\nDebt service coverage ratio is considered a key credit quality indicator when mortgage loan credit loss allowances are estimated. Debt service coverage ratio represents the amount of estimated cash flow from the property available to the borrower to meet principal and interest payment obligations. Debt service coverage ratio estimates are updated annually or more frequently if conditions are warranted based on the Company’s credit monitoring process.\nThe Allstate Corporation      127\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nMortgage loans with a debt service coverage ratio below 1.0 that are not considered impaired primarily relate to situations where the borrower has the financial capacity to fund the revenue shortfalls from the properties for the foreseeable term, the decrease in cash flows from the properties is considered\ntemporary, or there are other risk mitigating factors such as additional collateral, escrow balances or borrower guarantees. Payments on all mortgage loans were current as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n(1)\nIncludes $\n59\nmillion of credit loss allowance for mortgage loans that are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020.\nBank loans\nWhen it is determined a bank loan shall be evaluated individually, the Company uses various methods to estimate credit losses on individual loans such as the present value of the loan’s expected future repayment cash flows discounted at the loan’s current effective interest rate.\nCredit ratings of the borrower are considered a key credit quality indicator when bank loan credit loss allowances are estimated. The ratings are updated quarterly and are either received from a nationally recognized rating agency or a comparable internal rating is derived if an externally provided rating is not available. The year of origination is determined to be the year in which the asset is acquired.\n128      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nIncludes $\n16\nmillion of credit loss allowance for bank loans that are classified as held for sale as of December 31, 2020.\nFair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The hierarchy for inputs used in determining fair value maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Assets and liabilities recorded on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position at fair value are categorized in the fair value hierarchy based on the observability of inputs to the valuation techniques as follows:\nLevel 1:\nAssets and liabilities whose values are based on unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities in an active market that the Company can access.\nLevel 2:\nAssets and liabilities whose values are based on the following:\n(a)\nQuoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets;\n(b)\nQuoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active; or\n(c)\nValuation models whose inputs are observable, directly or indirectly, for substantially the full term of the asset or liability.\nLevel 3:\nAssets and liabilities whose values are based on prices or valuation techniques that require inputs that are both unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement. Unobservable inputs reflect the Company’s estimates of the assumptions that market participants would use in valuing the assets and liabilities.\nThe availability of observable inputs varies by instrument. In situations where fair value is based on internally developed pricing models or inputs that are unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. The degree of judgment exercised by the Company in determining fair value is typically greatest for instruments categorized in Level 3. In many instances, valuation inputs used to measure fair value fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. The category level in the fair value hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. The Company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date, including during periods of market disruption. In periods of market disruption, the ability to observe prices and inputs may be reduced for many instruments.\nThe Company is responsible for the determination of fair value and the supporting assumptions and methodologies. The Company gains assurance that assets and liabilities are appropriately valued through the execution of various processes and controls designed to ensure the overall reasonableness and consistent application of valuation methodologies, including inputs and assumptions, and compliance with accounting standards. For fair values received from third parties or internally estimated, the Company’s processes and controls are designed to ensure that the valuation methodologies are appropriate and consistently applied, the inputs and assumptions are reasonable and consistent with the objective of determining fair value, and the fair values are accurately recorded. For example, on a continuing basis, the Company assesses the reasonableness of\nThe Allstate Corporation      129\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nindividual fair values that have stale security prices or that exceed certain thresholds as compared to previous fair values received from valuation service providers or brokers or derived from internal models. The Company performs procedures to understand and assess the methodologies, processes and controls of valuation service providers. In addition, the Company may validate the reasonableness of fair values by comparing information obtained from valuation service providers or brokers to other third-party valuation sources for selected securities. The Company performs ongoing price validation procedures such as back-testing of actual sales, which corroborate the various inputs used in internal models to market observable data. When fair value determinations are expected to be more variable, the Company validates them through reviews by members of management who have relevant expertise and who are independent of those charged with executing investment transactions.\nThe Company has two types of situations where investments are classified as Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy:\n(1)\nSpecific inputs significant to the fair value estimation models are not market observable. This primarily occurs in the Company’s use of broker quotes to value certain securities where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable, and the use of valuation models that use significant non-market observable inputs.\n(2)\nQuotes continue to be received from independent third-party valuation service providers and all significant inputs are market observable; however, there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset when compared to normal market activity such that the degree of market observability has declined to a point where categorization as a Level 3 measurement is considered appropriate. The indicators considered in determining whether a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for a specific asset has occurred include the level of new issuances in the primary market, trading volume in the secondary market, the level of credit spreads over historical levels, applicable bid-ask spreads, and price consensus among market participants and other pricing sources.\nCertain assets are not carried at fair value on a recurring basis, including mortgage loans, bank loans and policy loans and are only included in the fair value hierarchy disclosure when the individual investment is reported at fair value.\nIn determining fair value, the Company principally uses the market approach which generally utilizes market transaction data for the same or similar instruments. To a lesser extent, the Company uses the income approach which involves determining fair values from discounted cash flow methodologies. For the majority of Level 2 and Level 3 valuations, a combination of the market and income approaches is used.\nSummary of significant inputs and valuation techniques for Level 2 and Level 3 assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis\nLevel 2 measurements\n•\nFixed income securities:\nU.S. government and agencies, municipal, corporate - public and foreign government:\nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.\nCorporate - privately placed:\nPrivately placed are valued using a discounted cash flow model that is widely accepted in the financial services industry and uses market observable inputs and inputs derived principally from, or corroborated by, observable market data. The primary inputs to the discounted cash flow model include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets in markets that are not active that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.\nCorporate - privately placed also includes redeemable preferred stock that are valued using quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, underlying stock prices and credit spreads.\nABS:\nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields, collateral performance, and credit spreads. Certain ABS are valued based on non-binding broker quotes whose inputs have been corroborated to be market observable. Residential MBS, included in ABS, uses prepayment speeds as a primary input for valuation.\n•\nEquity securities:\nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or quoted net asset values for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active.\n•\nShort-term:\nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that are not active, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads.\n•\nOther investments:\nFree-standing exchange listed derivatives that are not actively traded are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.\nOver-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives, including interest rate swaps, foreign currency swaps, total return swaps, foreign exchange forward contracts, certain options and certain credit default swaps, are valued using models that rely on inputs such as interest rate yield curves, implied volatilities, index price levels, currency rates, and credit spreads that are observable for substantially the full term of the contract. The valuation techniques underlying the\n130      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nmodels are widely accepted in the financial services industry and do not involve significant judgment.\n•\nAssets held for sale:\nComprise U.S. government and agencies, municipal, corporate, foreign government and ABS fixed income securities, equity securities, short-term investments and other investments. The valuation is based on the respective asset type as described above.\n•\nLiabilities held for sale:\nComprise other liabilities, mainly free-standing exchange listed derivatives, that are not actively traded and are valued based on quoted prices for identical instruments in markets that are not active.\nLevel 3 measurements\n•\nFixed income securities:\nMunicipal:\nComprise municipal bonds that are not rated by third-party credit rating agencies. The primary inputs to the valuation of these municipal bonds include quoted prices for identical or similar assets in markets that exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements, contractual cash flows, benchmark yields and credit spreads. Also included are municipal bonds valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and municipal bonds in default valued based on the present value of expected cash flows.\nCorporate - public and privately placed, ABS:\nPrimarily valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable. Other inputs for corporate fixed income securities include an interest rate yield curve, as well as published credit spreads for similar assets that incorporate the credit quality and industry sector of the issuer.\n•\nEquity securities:\nThe primary inputs to the valuation include quoted prices or quoted net asset values for identical or similar assets in markets that are less active relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements.\n•\nShort-term:\nFor certain short-term investments, amortized cost is used as the best estimate of fair value.\n•\nOther investments:\nCertain OTC derivatives, such as interest rate caps, certain credit default swaps and certain options (including swaptions), are valued using models that are widely accepted in the financial services industry. These are categorized as Level 3 as a result of the significance of non-market observable inputs such\nas volatility. Other primary inputs include interest rate yield curves and credit spreads and quoted prices for identical or similar assets in the markets that exhibit less liquidity relative to those markets supporting Level 2 fair value measurements.\n•\nOther assets:\nIncludes the contingent consideration provision in the sale agreement for ALIC which meets the definition of a derivative. This derivative is valued internally using a model that includes stochastically determined cash flows and inputs that include spot and forward interest rates, volatility, corporate credit spreads and a liquidity discount. This derivative is categorized as Level 3 due to the significance of non-market observable inputs.\n•\nAssets held for sale:\nComprise municipal, corporate and ABS fixed income securities and equity securities. The valuation is based on the respective asset type as described above.\n•\nLiabilities held for sale:\nComprise derivatives embedded in certain life and annuity contracts which are valued internally using models widely accepted in the financial services industry that determine a single best estimate of fair value for the embedded derivatives within a block of contractholder liabilities. The models primarily use stochastically determined cash flows based on the contractual elements of embedded derivatives, projected option cost and applicable market data, such as interest rate yield curves and equity index volatility assumptions. These are categorized as Level 3 as a result of the significance of non-market observable inputs.\nAssets measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis\nComprise long-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, including real estate, that are written down to fair value less costs to sell and bank loans with individual credit loss allowance where amortized cost, net is equal to fair value based on broker quotes.\nInvestments excluded from the fair value hierarchy\nLimited partnerships carried at fair value, which do not have readily determinable fair values, use NAV provided by the investees and are excluded from the fair value hierarchy. These investments are generally not redeemable by the investees and generally cannot be sold without approval of the general partner. The Company receives distributions of income and proceeds from the liquidation of the underlying assets of the investees, which usually takes place in years 4-9 of the typical contractual life of\n10\n-\n12\nyears. As of December 31, 2021, the Company has commitments to invest $\n236\nmillion in these limited partnership interests.\nThe Allstate Corporation      131\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n132      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, Level 3 fair value measurements of fixed income securities total $\n144\nmillion and $\n226\nmillion, respectively, and include $\n41\nmillion and $\n69\nmillion, respectively, of securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes where the inputs have not been corroborated to be market observable and $\n16\nmillion and $\n18\nmillion, respectively, of municipal fixed income securities that are not rated by third-party credit rating agencies. As the Company does not develop the Level 3 fair value\nunobservable inputs for these fixed income securities, they are not included in the table above. However, an increase (decrease) in credit spreads for fixed income securities valued based on non-binding broker quotes would result in a lower (higher) fair value, and an increase (decrease) in the credit rating of municipal bonds that are not rated by third-party credit rating agencies would result in a higher (lower) fair value.\nThe Allstate Corporation      133\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n134      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nTransfers into Level 3 during 2021, 2020 and 2019 included situations where a quote was not provided by the Company’s independent third-party valuation service provider and as a result the price was stale or had been replaced with a broker quote where the inputs had not been corroborated to be market observable resulting in the security being classified as Level 3. Transfers into Level 3 during 2019 also included derivatives embedded in equity-indexed universal life contracts due to refinements in the valuation modeling resulting in an increase in significance of non-market observable inputs.\nTransfers out of Level 3 during 2021, 2020 and 2019 included situations where a broker quote was used in the prior period and a quote became available from the Company’s independent third-party valuation service provider in the current period. A quote utilizing the new pricing source was not available as of the prior period, and any gains or losses related to the change in valuation source for individual securities were not significant.\nThe Allstate Corporation      135\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nEffective January 1, 2020, the Company adopted the fair value accounting standard that prospectively requires the disclosure of valuation changes reported in OCI.\n(1)\nRepresents the amounts reported on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position\n.\n(2)\nIncludes certain liabilities for collateral measured at Level 2 fair value as of December 31, 2020.\n136      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe Company uses derivatives for risk reduction and to increase investment portfolio returns through asset replication. Risk reduction activity is focused on managing the risks with certain assets and liabilities arising from the potential adverse impacts from changes in risk-free interest rates, changes in equity market valuations, increases in credit spreads and foreign currency fluctuations.\nAsset replication refers to the “synthetic” creation of assets through the use of derivatives. The Company replicates fixed income securities using a combination of a credit default swap, index total return swap, options, or a foreign currency forward contract and one or more highly rated fixed income securities, primarily investment grade host bonds, to synthetically replicate the economic characteristics of one or more cash market securities. The Company replicates equity securities using futures, index total return swaps, and options to increase equity exposure.\nProperty-Liability may use interest rate swaps, swaptions, futures and options to manage the interest rate risks of existing investments. These instruments are utilized to change the duration of the portfolio in order to offset the economic effect that interest rates would otherwise have on the fair value of its fixed income securities. Fixed income index total return swaps are used to offset valuation losses in the fixed income portfolio during periods of declining market values. Credit default swaps are typically used to mitigate the credit risk within the Property-Liability fixed income portfolio. Equity index total return swaps, futures and options are used by Property-Liability to offset valuation losses in the equity portfolio during periods of declining equity market values. In addition, equity futures are used to hedge the market risk related to deferred compensation liability contracts. Forward contracts are primarily used by Property-Liability to hedge foreign currency risk associated with holding foreign currency denominated investments and foreign operations.\nThe Company also has derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts that are required to be separated from the host contracts and accounted for at fair value with changes in fair value of embedded derivatives reported in net income.\nWhen derivatives meet specific criteria, they may be designated as accounting hedges and accounted for as fair value, cash flow, foreign currency fair value or foreign currency cash flow hedges.\nThe notional amounts specified in the contracts are used to calculate the exchange of contractual payments under the agreements and are generally not representative of the potential for gain or loss on these agreements. However, the notional amounts specified in credit default swaps where the Company has sold credit protection represent the maximum amount of potential loss, assuming\nno\nrecoveries.\nFair value, which is equal to the carrying value, is the estimated amount that the Company would receive\nor pay to terminate the derivative contracts at the reporting date. The carrying value amounts for OTC derivatives are further adjusted for the effects, if any, of enforceable master netting agreements and are presented on a net basis, by counterparty agreement, in the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nFor those derivatives which qualify and have been designated as fair value accounting hedges, net income includes the changes in the fair value of both the derivative instrument and the hedged risk. For cash flow hedges, gains and losses are amortized from AOCI and are reported in net income in the same period the forecasted transactions being hedged impact net income.\nNon-hedge accounting is generally used for “portfolio” level hedging strategies where the terms of the individual hedged items do not meet the strict homogeneity requirements to permit the application of hedge accounting. For non-hedge derivatives, net income includes changes in fair value and accrued periodic settlements, when applicable. With the exception of non-hedge derivatives used for asset replication and non-hedge embedded derivatives, all of the Company’s derivatives are evaluated for their ongoing effectiveness as either accounting hedge or non-hedge derivative financial instruments on at least a quarterly basis.\nAssets and liabilities held for sale\nAsset-liability management is a risk management practice that balances the cash flows and risk and return characteristics of assets and liabilities. Depending upon the attributes of the assets acquired and liabilities issued, derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps, caps, swaptions and futures were utilized to change the interest rate characteristics of existing assets and liabilities to ensure the relationship is maintained within specified ranges and to reduce exposure to rising or falling interest rates. Futures and options were used for hedging the equity exposure contained in equity indexed life and annuity product contracts that offer equity returns to contractholders.\nThe Company’s primary embedded derivatives were equity options in life and annuity product contracts, which provided returns linked to equity indices to contractholders.\nIn connection with the sale of ALIC and certain affiliates, the sale agreement includes a provision related to contingent consideration that may be earned over a\nten-year\nperiod commencing on January 1, 2026 and ending January 1, 2035. The contingent consideration is determined annually based on the average 10-year Treasury rate over the preceding 3-year period compared to a designated rate. The contingent consideration meets the definition of a derivative and is accounted for on a fair value basis with periodic changes in fair value reflected in earnings. As of December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $\n65\nmillion in other assets related to this derivative.\nThe Allstate Corporation      137\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nVolume for OTC and cleared derivative contracts is represented by their notional amounts. Volume for exchange traded derivatives is represented by the number of contracts, which is the basis on which they are traded. (n/a = not applicable)\n138      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nAll OTC derivatives are subject to enforceable master netting agreements.\nThe Allstate Corporation      139\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Company manages its exposure to credit risk by utilizing highly rated counterparties, establishing risk control limits, executing legally enforceable master netting agreements (“MNAs”) and obtaining collateral where appropriate. The Company uses MNAs for OTC derivative transactions that permit either party to net payments due for transactions and collateral is either pledged or obtained when certain predetermined exposure limits are exceeded.\n(1)\nIncludes\nno\ncollateral posted under MNA’s for contracts containing credit-risk-contingent provisions that are in a liability provision.\nThe Company has not incurred any losses on derivative financial instruments due to counterparty nonperformance. Other derivatives, including futures and certain option contracts, are traded on organized exchanges which require margin deposits and guarantee the execution of trades, thereby mitigating any potential credit risk.\nCounterparty credit exposure represents the Company’s potential loss if all of the counterparties concurrently fail to perform under the contractual terms of the contracts and all collateral, if any, becomes worthless. This exposure is measured by the fair value of OTC derivative contracts with a positive fair value at the reporting date reduced by the effect, if any, of legally enforceable master netting agreements.\n140      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nAllstate uses the lower of S&P’s or Moody’s long-term debt issuer ratings.\n(2)\nOnly OTC derivatives with a net positive fair value are included for each counterparty.\nFor certain exchange traded and cleared derivatives, margin deposits are required as well as daily cash settlements of margin accounts.\nMarket risk is the risk that the Company will incur losses due to adverse changes in market rates and prices. Market risk exists for all of the derivative financial instruments the Company currently holds, as these instruments may become less valuable due to adverse changes in market conditions. To limit this risk, the Company’s senior management has established risk control limits. In addition, changes in fair value of the derivative financial instruments that the Company uses for risk management purposes are generally offset by the change in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged risk component of the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions.\nCertain of the Company’s derivative transactions contain credit-risk-contingent termination events and cross-default provisions. Credit-risk-contingent termination events allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative agreement or a specific trade on certain dates if AIC’s financial strength credit ratings by Moody’s or S&P fall below a certain level. Credit-risk-contingent cross-default provisions allow the counterparties to terminate the derivative agreement if the Company defaults by pre-determined threshold amounts on certain debt instruments.\nThe following summarizes the fair value of derivative instruments with termination, cross-default or collateral credit-risk-contingent features that are in a liability position, as well as the fair value of assets and collateral that are netted against the liability in accordance with provisions within legally enforceable MNAs.\nCredit derivatives - selling protection\nA credit default swap (“CDS”) is a derivative instrument, representing an agreement between two parties to exchange the credit risk of a specified entity (or a group of entities), or an index based on the credit risk of a group of entities (all commonly referred to as the “reference entity” or a portfolio of “reference entities”), in return for a periodic premium.\nIn selling protection, CDS are used to replicate fixed income securities and to complement the cash market when credit exposure to certain issuers is not available or when the derivative alternative is less expensive than the cash market alternative. CDS typically have a\nfive-year\nterm.\nThe Allstate Corporation      141\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nIn selling protection with CDS, the Company sells credit protection on an identified single name, a basket of names in a first-to-default (“FTD”) structure or credit derivative index (“CDX”) that is generally investment grade, and in return receives periodic premiums through expiration or termination of the agreement. With single name CDS, this premium or credit spread generally corresponds to the difference between the yield on the reference entity’s public fixed maturity cash instruments and swap rates at the time the agreement is executed. With a FTD basket, because of the additional credit risk inherent in a basket of named reference entities, the premium generally corresponds to a high proportion of the sum of the credit spreads of the names in the basket and the correlation between the names. CDX is utilized to take a position on multiple (generally 125) reference entities. Credit events are typically defined as bankruptcy, failure to pay, or restructuring, depending on the nature of the reference entities. If a credit event occurs, the Company settles with the counterparty, either through physical settlement or cash settlement. In a physical settlement, a reference asset is delivered by the buyer\nof protection to the Company, in exchange for cash payment at par, whereas in a cash settlement, the Company pays the difference between par and the prescribed value of the reference asset. When a credit event occurs in a single name or FTD basket (for FTD, the first credit event occurring for any one name in the basket), the contract terminates at the time of settlement. For CDX, the reference entity’s name incurring the credit event is removed from the index while the contract continues until expiration. The maximum payout on a CDS is the contract notional amount. A physical settlement may afford the Company with recovery rights as the new owner of the asset.\nThe Company monitors risk associated with credit derivatives through individual name credit limits at both a credit derivative and a combined cash instrument/credit derivative level. The ratings of individual names for which protection has been sold are also monitored.\nOff-balance sheet financial instruments\nCommitments to invest, commitments to purchase private placement securities, commitments to fund loans, financial guarantees and credit guarantees have off-balance sheet risk because their contractual amounts are not recorded in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nIn the preceding table, the contractual amounts represent the amount at risk if the contract is fully drawn upon, the counterparty defaults and the value of any underlying security becomes worthless. Unless noted otherwise, the Company does not require collateral or other security to support off-balance sheet financial instruments with credit risk.\nCommitments to invest in limited partnership interests represent agreements to acquire new or additional participation in certain limited partnership investments. The Company enters into these agreements in the normal course of business. Because the investments in limited partnerships are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate the fair value of these commitments.\n142      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nPrivate placement commitments represent commitments to purchase private placement debt and private equity securities at a future date. The Company enters into these agreements in the normal course of business. The fair value of the debt commitments generally cannot be estimated on the date the commitment is made as the terms and conditions of the underlying private placement securities are not yet final. Because the private equity securities are not actively traded, it is not practical to estimate fair value of the commitments.\nOther loan commitments are agreements to lend to a borrower provided there is no violation of any condition established in the contract. The Company enters into these agreements to commit to future loan fundings at predetermined interest rates. Unless unconditionally cancellable, the Company recognizes a credit loss allowance on such commitments. Commitments have either fixed or varying expiration dates or other termination clauses. The fair value of these commitments is insignificant.\nConsolidated VIEs, of which the Company is the primary beneficiary, primarily include Adirondack Insurance Exchange, a New York reciprocal insurer, and New Jersey Skylands Insurance Association, a New Jersey reciprocal insurer (together “Reciprocal Exchanges”). The Reciprocal Exchanges are insurance carriers organized as unincorporated associations. The Company does not own the equity of the Reciprocal Exchanges, which is owned by their respective policyholders.\nThe Company manages the business operations of the Reciprocal Exchanges and has the power to direct their activities that most significantly impact their economic performance. The Company receives a management fee for the services provided to the Reciprocal Exchanges. In addition, the Company holds interests that provide capital to the Reciprocal Exchanges and would absorb any expected losses. The Company is therefore the primary beneficiary.\nIn the event of dissolution, policyholders would share any residual unassigned surplus but are not subject to assessment for any deficit in unassigned surplus of the Reciprocal Exchanges. The assets of the Reciprocal Exchanges can be used only to settle the obligations of the Reciprocal Exchanges and general creditors have no recourse to the Company. The results of operations of the Reciprocal Exchanges are included in the Company’s Allstate Protection segment and generated $\n181\nmillion of earned premiums and $\n135\nmillion in claims and claims expenses in 2021.\nThe Company establishes reserves for claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. The Company’s reserving process takes into account known facts and interpretations of circumstances and factors including the Company’s experience with similar cases, actual claims paid, historical trends involving claim payment patterns and pending levels of unpaid claims, loss management programs, product mix and contractual terms, changes\nin law and regulation, judicial decisions, and economic conditions.\nWhen the Company experiences changes in the mix or type of claims or changing claim settlement patterns, it may need to apply actuarial judgment in the determination and selection of development factors to be more reflective of the new trends. For example, the Coronavirus has had a significant impact on driving patterns and auto frequency. Supply chain\nThe Allstate Corporation      143\n2021 Form 10-K\nFinancial Statements\ndisruptions have resulted in higher parts costs and used car values which have combined with labor shortages to increase physical damage loss costs while medical inflation, treatment trends and higher levels of attorney representation have increased liability losses. These factors may lead to historical development trends being less predictive of future loss development, potentially creating additional reserve variability. Generally, the initial reserves for a new accident year are established based on actual claim frequency and severity assumptions for different business segments, lines and coverages based on historical relationships to relevant inflation indicators. Reserves for prior accident years are statistically determined using several different actuarial estimation methods. Changes in auto claim frequency may result from changes in mix of business, the rate of distracted driving, miles driven or other macroeconomic factors. Changes in auto current year claim severity are generally influenced by inflation in the medical and auto repair sectors, the effectiveness and efficiency of claim practices and changes in mix of claim types. The Company mitigates these effects through various loss management programs. When such changes in claim data occur, actuarial judgment is used to determine appropriate development factors to establish reserves.\nAs part of the reserving process, the Company may also supplement its claims processes by utilizing third-party adjusters, appraisers, engineers, inspectors, and other professionals and information sources to assess and settle catastrophe and non-catastrophe related claims. The effects of inflation are implicitly considered in the reserving process.\nBecause reserves are estimates of unpaid portions of losses that have occurred, including IBNR losses, the establishment of appropriate reserves, including reserves for catastrophes, Run-off Property-Liability and reinsurance and indemnification recoverables, is an inherently uncertain and complex process. The ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management’s best estimates.\nThe highest degree of uncertainty is associated with reserves for losses incurred in the initial reporting period as it contains the greatest proportion of losses that have not been reported or settled. The Company also has uncertainty in the Run-off Property-Liability reserves that are based on events long since passed and are complicated by lack of historical data, legal interpretations, unresolved legal issues and legislative intent based on establishment of facts.\nThe Company regularly updates its reserve estimates as new information becomes available and as events unfold that may affect the resolution of unsettled claims. Changes in reserve estimates, which may be material, are reported in property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations in the period such changes are determined.\n(1)\nRecoverables comprises reinsurance and indemnification recoverables. See\nNote 11\nfor further details.\n144      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nPaid and incurred includes amounts primarily related to the acquisition of SafeAuto. Additionally, incurred includes the amortization of the fair value adjustment related to the acquisition of National General.\nIncurred claims and claims expense represents the sum of paid losses, claim adjustment expenses and reserve changes in the calendar year. This expense includes losses from catastrophes of $\n3.34\nbillion, $\n2.81\nbillion and $\n2.56\nbillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, net of recoverables. Catastrophes are an inherent risk of the property and casualty insurance business that have contributed to, and will continue to contribute to, material year-to-year fluctuations in the Company’s results of operations and financial position.\nThe Company calculates and records a single best reserve estimate for losses from catastrophes, in conformance with generally accepted actuarial standards. As a result, management believes that no other estimate is better than the recorded amount. Due to the uncertainties involved, including the factors described above, the ultimate cost of losses may vary materially from recorded amounts, which are based on management’s best estimates. Accordingly, management believes that it is not practical to develop a meaningful range for any such changes in losses incurred.\n(1)\nFavorable reserve reestimates are shown in parentheses.\n(2)\nIncludes approximately $\n240\nmillion of estimated recoveries related to Nationwide Aggregate Reinsurance Program cover for aggregate catastrophe losses occurring between April 1, 2020 and December 31, 2020, which primarily impacted homeowners reestimates.\n(3)\nIncludes approximately $\n110\nmillion favorable subrogation settlements arising from the Woolsey wildfire, which primarily impacted homeowners reestimates.\n(4)\n2020 includes approximately $\n495\nmillion of favorable reserve reestimates related to the PG&E Corporation and Southern California Edison subrogation settlements, which primarily impacted homeowners.\n(5)\nThe Company’s 2021 annual reserve review, using established industry and actuarial best practices, resulted in unfavorable reestimates of $\n111\nmillion.\nThe Allstate Corporation      145\n2021 Form 10-K\nFinancial Statements\nThe following presents information about incurred and paid claims development as of December 31, 2021, net of recoverables, as well as the cumulative number of reported claims and the total of IBNR reserves plus expected development on reported claims included in the net incurred claims amounts.

The Company purchases reinsurance after evaluating the financial condition of the reinsurer as well as the terms and price of coverage.\nIndemnification programs\nThe Company participates in state-based industry pools or facilities mandating participation by insurers offering certain coverage in their state, including the Michigan Catastrophic Claims Association (“MCCA”), the New Jersey Property-Liability Insurance Guaranty Association (“PLIGA”), the North Carolina Reinsurance Facility (“NCRF”) and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund (“FHCF”). When the Company pays qualifying claims under the coverage indemnified by a state’s pool or facility, the Company is reimbursed for the qualifying claim losses or expenses. Each state pool or facility may assess participating companies to collect sufficient amounts to meet its total indemnification requirements. The enabling legislation for each state’s pool or facility compels the pool or facility only to indemnify participating companies for qualifying claim losses or expenses; the state pool or facility does not underwrite the coverage or take on the ultimate risk of the indemnified business. As a pass through, these pools or facilities manage the receipt of assessments paid by participating companies and payment of indemnified amounts for covered claims presented by participating companies. The Company has not had any credit losses related to these indemnification programs.\nState-based industry pools or facilities\nMichigan Catastrophic Claims Association\nThe MCCA is a statutory indemnification mechanism for member insurers’ qualifying personal injury protection claims paid for the unlimited lifetime medical benefits above the applicable retention level for qualifying injuries from automobile, motorcycle and commercial vehicle accidents. Indemnification recoverables on paid and unpaid claims, including IBNR, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 include $\n6.70\nbillion and $\n5.65\nbillion, respectively, from the MCCA for its indemnification obligation.\nThe MCCA is funded by annually assessing participating member companies actively writing motor vehicle coverage in Michigan on a per vehicle basis that is currently $\n86\nper vehicle insured. The MCCA’s calculation of the annual assessment is based upon the total of members’ actuarially determined present value of expected payments on lifetime claims by all persons expected to be catastrophically injured in that year and ultimately qualify for MCCA reimbursement, its operating expenses, and adjustments for the amount of excesses or deficiencies in prior assessments. The MCCA has also included its calculation of the impacts of the auto insurance reforms which have begun to phase in since their passage in June 2019, including the personal injury protection medical fee schedule that became effective July 2, 2021.\nThe assessment is incurred by the Company as policies are written and recovered as a component of premiums from the Company’s customers.\nThe MCCA indemnifies qualifying claims of all current and former member companies (whether or not actively writing motor vehicle coverage in Michigan) for qualifying claims and claims expenses incurred while the member companies were actively writing the mandatory personal injury protection coverage in Michigan. Member companies actively writing automobile coverage in Michigan include the MCCA annual assessments in determining the level of premiums to charge insureds in the state.\nAs required for member companies by the MCCA, the Company reports covered paid and unpaid claims to the MCCA when estimates of loss for a reported claim are expected to exceed the retention level, the claims involve certain types of severe injuries, or there are litigation demands received suggesting the claim value exceeds certain thresholds. The retention level is adjusted upward every other MCCA fiscal year by the lesser of\n6\n% or the increase in the Consumer Price Index. The retention level will be $\n600\nthousand per claim for the fiscal\ntwo-years\nending June 30, 2023 compared to $\n580\nthousand per claim for the fiscal\ntwo-years\nending June 30, 2021.\nThe MCCA is obligated to fund the ultimate liability of member companies’ qualifying claims and claim expenses. The MCCA does not underwrite the insurance coverage or hold any underwriting risk.\nThe MCCA indemnifies members as qualifying claims are paid and billed by members to the MCCA. Unlimited lifetime covered losses result in significant levels of ultimate incurred claim reserves being recorded by member companies along with offsetting indemnification recoverables. Disputes with claimants over coverage on certain reported claims can result in additional losses, which may be recoverable from the MCCA, excluding litigation expenses. There is currently no method by which insurers are able to obtain the benefit of managed care programs to reduce claims costs through the MCCA.\nThe Allstate Corporation      153\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe MCCA annual assessments fund current operations and member company reimbursements. The MCCA prepares statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the State of Michigan Department of Insurance and Financial Services (“MI DOI”). The MI DOI has granted the MCCA a statutory permitted practice that expires in June 30, 2022 to discount its liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expense. As of June 30, 2021, the date of its most recent annual financial report, the MCCA had cash and invested assets of $\n27.26\nbillion and an accumulated surplus of $\n5.04\nbillion. The permitted practice reduced the accumulated deficit by $\n31.28\nbillion. As a result of the auto insurance reforms passed in June 2019, the MCCA announced on November 3, 2021 that the surplus had increased beyond a level necessary to safely cover its expected losses and expenses and will return a portion of its surplus to its member insurance companies as a pass-through to issue a refund of $\n400\nper vehicle and $\n80\nper historical vehicle to the policyholders.

Assessments paid to PLIGA for the EMB program totaled $\n7\nmillion in 2021. The amounts of paid and unpaid recoverables as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n371\nmillion and $\n389\nmillion, respectively.\nPLIGA annually assesses all admitted property and casualty insurers writing covered lines in New Jersey for PLIGA indemnification and expenses. PLIGA assessments may be recouped as a surcharge on premiums collected. PLIGA does not ultimately retain underwriting risk as it assesses member companies for their expected qualifying losses to provide funding for payment of its indemnification obligation to member companies for their actual losses. As a pass through, PLIGA facilitates these transactions of receipt of assessments paid by member companies and payment to member companies for covered claims presented by them for indemnification. As of December 31, 2020, the date of its most recent annual financial report, PLIGA had a fund balance of $\n254\nmillion.\nAs statutory administrator of the UCJF, PLIGA provides compensation to qualified claimants for personal injury protection, bodily injury, or death caused by private passenger automobiles operated by uninsured or “hit and run” drivers.

All insurers licensed to write automobile insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCRF. Premiums, losses and expenses are assigned to the NCRF. North Carolina law allows the NCRF to recoup operating losses for certain insureds through a surcharge to policyholders. As of September 30, 2021, the NCRF reported a deficit of $\n67\nmillion in members’ equity. The NCRF implemented a loss recoupment surcharge on all private passenger and commercial fleet policies effective October 1, 2021, through September 30, 2022. Member companies are assessed the recoupment surcharge. The loss recoupment surcharge will be adjusted on October 1, 2022 and discontinued once losses are recovered. The NCRF results are shared by the member companies in proportion to their respective North Carolina automobile liability writings. For the fiscal year ending September 30, 2021, net gain was $\n58\nmillion, including $\n1.11\nbillion of earned premiums, $\n244\nmillion of certain private passenger auto risk recoupment and $\n127\nmillion of member loss recoupments. As of December 31, 2021, the NCRF recoverables on paid claims is $\n51\nmillion and recoverables on unpaid claims is $\n228\nmillion.

Castle Key has exposure to assessments and pays annual premiums to the FHCF for this reimbursement protection. The FHCF has the authority to issue bonds to pay its obligations to participating insurers in excess of its capital balances. Payment of these bonds is funded by emergency assessments on all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers’ compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the National Flood Insurance Program (“NFIP”). The FHCF emergency assessments are limited to\n6\n% of premiums per year beginning the first year in which\n154      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nreimbursements require bonding, and up to a total of\n10\n% of premiums per year for assessments in the second and subsequent years, if required to fund additional bonding. The FHCF issued $\n2.00\nbillion in pre-event bonds in 2013 to build its capacity to reimburse member companies’ claims. The FHCF plans to fund these pre-event bonds through current FHCF cash flows. Pursuant to an Order issued by the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation, the emergency assessment is\nzero\nfor all policies issued or renewed on or after January 1, 2015.\nAnnual premiums earned and paid under the FHCF agreement were $\n15\nmillion, $\n9\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Qualifying losses were $\n13\nmillion, $\n15\nmillion and $\n33\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

The amounts recoverable from the FHCF totaled $\n25\nmillion and $\n32\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nFederal Government - National Flood Insurance Program\nNFIP is a program administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (“FEMA”) whereby the Company sells and services NFIP flood insurance policies as an agent of FEMA and receives fees for its services. The Company is fully indemnified for claims and claim expenses and does not retain any ultimate risk for the indemnified business. The federal government is obligated to pay all claims and certain allocated loss adjustment expenses in accordance with the arrangement.\nCongressional authorization for the NFIP is periodically evaluated and may be subjected to freezes, including when the federal government experiences a shutdown. FEMA has a NFIP reinsurance program to manage the future exposure of the NFIP through the transfer of risk to private reinsurance companies and capital market investors. Congress is evaluating the funding of the program as well as considering reforms to the program that would be incorporated in legislation to reauthorize the NFIP.\nThe amounts recoverable as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n34\nmillion and $\n30\nmillion, respectively. Premiums earned under the NFIP include $\n350\nmillion, $\n261\nmillion and $\n258\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Qualifying losses incurred include $\n267\nmillion, $\n87\nmillion and $\n150\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCatastrophe reinsurance\nThe Company’s reinsurance program is designed to provide reinsurance protection for catastrophes resulting from multiple perils including hurricanes, windstorms, hail, tornadoes, winter storms, wildfires, earthquakes and fires following earthquakes.\n•\nThe Company purchases reinsurance from traditional reinsurance companies as well as the insurance linked securities market.\n•\nThe majority of the Company’s program comprises multi-year contracts, primarily placed in the traditional reinsurance market, such that generally one-third of the program is renewed every year.\n•\nCoverage is generally purchased on a broad geographic, product line and multiple peril loss basis.\n•\nFlorida personal lines property is covered by a separate agreement, as the risk of loss is different and the Company’s subsidiaries operating in this state are separately capitalized.\n•\nA portion of New Jersey personal lines property and automobile remains covered by a separate standalone agreement.\n•\nWhen applicable, reinsurance reinstatement premiums are recognized in the same period as the loss event that gave rise to the reinstatement premium and are recorded in claims and claims expense in the consolidated statements of operations.\nThe Company’s current catastrophe reinsurance program supports the Company’s risk tolerance framework that targets less than a 1% likelihood of annual aggregate catastrophe losses from hurricanes, earthquakes and wildfires, net of reinsurance, exceeding $\n2.5\nbillion.\nThe program includes coverage for losses to personal lines property, personal lines automobile, commercial lines property or commercial lines automobile arising out of multiple perils, in addition to hurricanes and earthquakes. These reinsurance agreements are part of the catastrophe management strategy, which is intended to provide shareholders an acceptable return on the risks assumed in the property business, and to reduce variability of earnings, while providing protection to customers. The Company has the following catastrophe reinsurance agreements in effect as of December 31, 2021.\nThe June 1, 2021 Nationwide Excess Catastrophe Reinsurance Program (the “Nationwide Program”) provides coverage up to $\n5.76\nbillion of loss less a $\n500\nmillion retention, and is subject to the percentage of reinsurance placed in each of its agreements.

Interest compounds during such deferral periods at the rate in effect for each period. The interest deferral feature obligates the Company in certain circumstances to issue common stock or certain other types of securities if it cannot otherwise raise sufficient funds to make the required interest payments. The Company has reserved\n75\nmillion shares of its authorized and unissued common stock to satisfy this obligation.\nThe terms of the Company’s outstanding subordinated debentures prohibit the Company from declaring or paying any dividends or distributions on common or preferred stock or redeeming, purchasing, acquiring, or making liquidation payments on common stock or preferred stock if the Company has elected to defer interest payments on the subordinated debentures, subject to certain limited exceptions.\nIn connection with the issuance of the Debentures, the Company entered into a replacement capital covenant (“RCC”). This covenant was not intended for the benefit of the holders of the Debentures and could not be enforced by them. Rather, it was for the benefit of holders of one or more other designated series of the Company’s indebtedness (“covered debt”), currently the\n5.750\n% Subordinated Debentures due 2053. Pursuant to the RCC, the Company has agreed that it will not repay, redeem, or purchase the Debentures on or before May 15, 2067 (or such earlier date on which the RCC terminates by its terms) unless, subject to certain limitations, the Company has received net cash proceeds in specified amounts from the sale of common stock or certain other qualifying securities.

This facility has a financial covenant requiring the Company not to exceed a\n37.5\n% debt to capitalization ratio as defined in the agreement. Although the right to borrow under the facility is not subject to a minimum rating requirement, the costs of maintaining the facility and borrowing\nunder it are based on the ratings of the Company’s senior unsecured, unguaranteed long-term debt. The total amount outstanding at any point in time under the combination of the commercial paper program and the credit facility cannot exceed the amount that can be borrowed under the credit facility.\nNo\namounts were outstanding under the credit facility as of December 31, 2021 or 2020.

The Company will pay dividends on the preferred stock on a noncumulative basis only when, as and if declared by the Company’s board of directors (or a duly authorized committee of the board) and to the extent that the Company has legally available funds to pay dividends. If dividends are declared on the preferred stock, they will be payable quarterly in arrears at an annual fixed rate. Dividends on the preferred stock are not cumulative. Accordingly, in the event dividends are not declared on the preferred stock for payment on any dividend payment date, then those dividends will cease to be payable. If the Company has not declared a dividend before the dividend payment date for any dividend period, the Company has no obligation to pay dividends for that dividend period, whether or not dividends are declared for any future dividend period. No dividends may be paid or declared on the Company’s common stock and no shares of the Company’s common stock may be repurchased unless the full dividends for the latest completed dividend period on the preferred stock have been declared and paid or provided for.\nThe Company is prohibited from declaring or paying dividends on its Series G preferred stock in excess of the amount of net proceeds from an issuance of common stock taking place within\n90\ndays before a dividend declaration date if, on that dividend declaration date, either: (1) the risk-based capital ratios of the largest U.S. property-casualty insurance subsidiaries that collectively account for\n80\n% or more of the net written premiums of U.S. property-casualty insurance business on a weighted average basis were less than\n175\n% of their company action level risk-based capital as of the end of the most recent year; or (2) consolidated net income for the four-quarter period ending on the preliminary quarter end test date (the quarter that is two quarters prior to the most recently completed quarter) is zero or negative and consolidated shareholders’ equity (excluding AOCI, and subject to certain other adjustments relating to changes in U.S. GAAP) as of each of the preliminary quarter test date and the most recently completed quarter has declined by\n20\n% or more from its level as measured at the end of the benchmark quarter (the date that is ten quarters prior to the most recently\ncompleted quarter). If the Company fails to satisfy either of these tests on any dividend declaration date, the restrictions on dividends will continue until the Company is able again to satisfy the test on a dividend declaration date. In addition, in the case of a restriction arising under (2) above, the restrictions on dividends will continue until consolidated shareholders’ equity (excluding AOCI, and subject to certain other adjustments relating to changes in U.S. GAAP) has increased, or has declined by less than\n20\n%, in either case as compared to its level at the end of the benchmark quarter for each dividend payment date as to which dividend restrictions were imposed.\nThe preferred stock does not have voting rights except with respect to certain changes in the terms of the preferred stock, in the case of certain dividend nonpayments, certain other fundamental corporate events, mergers or consolidations and as otherwise provided by law. If and when dividends have not been declared and paid in full for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent (whether or not consecutive), the authorized number of directors then constituting our board of directors will be increased by\ntwo\n. The holders of the preferred stock, together with the holders of all other affected classes and series of voting parity stock, voting as a single class, will be entitled to elect the\ntwo\nadditional members of the board of directors of the Company, subject to certain conditions.

These programs generally involve a reduction in staffing levels, and in certain cases, office closures. Restructuring and related charges primarily include the following costs related to these programs:\n•\nEmployee\n- severance and relocation benefits\n•\nExit\n- contract termination penalties\nThe expenses related to these activities are included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations as restructuring and related charges and totaled $\n170\nmillion, $\n253\nmillion and $\n39\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nRestructuring expenses in 2021 are primarily due to the future of work environment as we reevaluate our facilities footprint. The Company continues to identify ways to improve operating efficiency and reduce cost which may result in additional restructuring charges in the future.\n160      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nThese charges are primarily in the Allstate Protection segment. The actions related to the Transformative Growth program are substantially complete as of December 31, 2021. The future work environment program will be substantially complete in the first half of 2022 based on decisions made through December 31, 2021.\nEmployee costs include severance and employee benefits primarily impacting claims, sales, service and support functions. Exit costs, primarily related to future work environment, reflect real estate costs primarily related to accelerated amortization of right of use assets and related leasehold improvements at facilities to be vacated.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the cumulative amount incurred to date for active programs related to employee severance, relocation benefits and exit expenses totaled $\n247\nmillion for employee costs and $\n157\nmillion for exit costs.\nShared markets and state facility assessments\nThe Company is required to participate in assigned risk plans, reinsurance facilities and joint underwriting associations in various states that provide insurance coverage to individuals or entities that otherwise are unable to purchase such coverage from private insurers.\nThe Company routinely reviews its exposure to assessments from these plans, facilities and government programs. Underwriting results related to these arrangements, which tend to be adverse, have been immaterial to the Company’s results of operations in the last three years. Because of the Company’s participation, it may be exposed to losses that surpass the capitalization of these facilities or assessments from these facilities.\nFlorida Citizens\nCastle Key is subject to assessments from Citizens Property Insurance Corporation in the state of Florida (“FL Citizens”), which was initially created by the state of Florida to provide insurance to property owners unable to obtain coverage in the private insurance market. FL Citizens, at the discretion and direction of its Board of Governors, can levy a regular assessment on assessable insurers and assessable insureds for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of:\n2\n% of the projected deficit or\n2\n% of the aggregate statewide direct written premium for the prior calendar year. The base of assessable insurers includes all property and casualty premiums in the state, except workers’ compensation, medical malpractice, accident and health insurance and policies written under the NFIP. An insurer may recoup a\nregular assessment through a surcharge to policyholders. In order to recoup this assessment, an insurer must file for a policy surcharge with the Florida Office of Insurance Regulation at least\nfifteen days\nprior to imposing the surcharge on policies. If a deficit remains after the regular assessment, FL Citizens can also levy emergency assessments in the current and subsequent years. Companies are required to collect the emergency assessments directly from residential property policyholders and remit to FL Citizens as collected. Currently, the emergency assessment is\nzero\nfor all policies issued or renewed on or after July 1, 2015.\nLouisiana Citizens\nLouisiana Citizens Property Insurance Corporation (“LA Citizens”) can levy a regular assessment on participating companies for a deficit in any calendar year up to a maximum of the greater of\n10\n% of the calendar year deficit or\n10\n% of Louisiana direct property premiums industry-wide for the prior calendar year.\nIf the plan year deficit exceeds the amount that can be recovered through regular assessments, LA Citizens may fund the remaining deficit by issuing revenue assessment bonds in the capital markets. LA Citizens then declares emergency assessments each year to provide debt service on the bonds until they are retired. Companies writing assessable lines must surcharge their policyholders emergency assessments in the percentage established annually by LA Citizens and must remit amounts collected to the bond trustee on a quarterly basis. Emergency assessments to pay off bonds issued in 2007 for the hurricanes of 2005 will continue until 2025.\nThe Allstate Corporation      161\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nFacilities such as FL Citizens and LA Citizens are generally designed so that the ultimate cost is borne by policyholders; however, the exposure to assessments from these facilities and the availability of recoupments or premium rate increases may not offset each other in the Company’s financial statements. Moreover, even if they do offset each other, they may not offset each other in financial statements for the same fiscal period due to the ultimate timing of the assessments and recoupments or premium rate increases, as well as the possibility of policies not being renewed in subsequent years.\nCalifornia Earthquake Authority\nExposure to certain potential losses from earthquakes in California is limited by the Company’s participation in the California Earthquake Authority (“CEA”), which provides insurance for California earthquake losses. The CEA is a privately-financed, publicly-managed state agency created to provide insurance coverage for earthquake damage. Insurers selling homeowners insurance in California are required to offer earthquake insurance to their customers either through their company or by participation in the CEA. The Company’s homeowners policies continue to include coverages for losses caused by explosions, theft, glass breakage and fires following an earthquake, which are not underwritten by the CEA.\nAs of October 31, 2021, the CEA’s capital balance was approximately $\n5.70\nbillion. Should losses arising from an earthquake cause a deficit in the CEA, an additional $\n1.70\nbillion would be obtained from the proceeds of revenue bonds the CEA may issue, an existing $\n9.50\nbillion reinsurance layer, $\n1.00\nbillion from policy surcharge, and finally, if needed, assessments on participating insurance companies. Participating insurers are required to pay an assessment, currently estimated not to exceed $\n1.70\nbillion, if the capital of the CEA falls below $\n350\nmillion. Within the limits previously described, the assessment could be intended to restore the CEA’s capital to a level of $\n350\nmillion. There is no provision that allows insurers to recover assessments through a premium surcharge or other mechanism. The CEA’s projected aggregate claim paying capacity is $\n19.60\nbillion as of October 31, 2021 and if an event were to result in claims greater than its capacity, affected policyholders may be paid a prorated portion of their covered losses, paid on an installment basis, or no payments may be made if the claim paying capacity of the CEA is insufficient.\nAll future assessments on participating CEA insurers are based on their CEA insurance market share as of December 31 of the preceding year. As of December 31, 2020, the Company’s market share was\n8.7\n%. The Company does not expect its market share to materially change. At this level, the Company’s maximum possible CEA assessment was $\n144\nmillion during 2021. These amounts are re-evaluated by the board of directors of the CEA on an annual basis. Accordingly, assessments from the CEA for a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not the financial position of the Company. Management believes the\nCompany’s exposure to earthquake losses in California has been significantly reduced as a result of its participation in the CEA.\nTexas Windstorm Insurance Association\nThe Company participates as a member of the Texas Windstorm Insurance Association (“TWIA”), which provides wind and hail property coverage to coastal risks unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. Wind and hail coverage is written on a TWIA-issued policy. TWIA follows a funding structure first utilizing currently available funds set aside from current and prior years. Under the current law, to the extent losses exceed premiums received from policyholders, TWIA utilizes a combination of reinsurance, TWIA issued securities, as well as member and policyholder assessments to fund loss payments.\nAny assessments from TWIA for a particular quarter or annual period may be material to the results of operations and cash flows, but not to the financial position of the Company.\nTexas Fair Plan Association\nThe Company participates as a member of the Texas Fair Plan Association (“FAIR Plan”), which provides residential property insurance to inland areas designated as underserved by the Commissioner of Insurance and the applicant(s) are unable to procure coverage in the voluntary market. The FAIR Plan issues insurance policies, like an insurance company, and it also functions as a pooling mechanism that allocates premiums, claims and expenses back to the insurance industry. As a result of the losses incurred related to Hurricane Harvey, in 2017 the FAIR Plan Board unanimously voted to approve its first ever member assessment of which the Company’s share was $\n8\nmillion based on total direct premium written in Texas. Insurers are permitted to recover the assessment through either a premium surcharge applied to existing customers over a three-year period or increased rates, but the ability to fully recover the assessment may be impacted by market conditions or other factors.\nNorth Carolina Joint Underwriters Association\nThe North Carolina Joint Underwriters Association (“NCJUA”) was created to provide property insurance for properties (other than the state’s beach and coastal areas) that insurers are not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write property insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCJUA. Premiums, losses and expenses of the NCJUA are shared by the member companies in proportion to their respective North Carolina property insurance writings. Member companies participate in plan deficits or surpluses based on their participation ratios, which are determined annually. The Company had a $\n5\nmillion receivable from the NCJUA at December 31, 2021 representing our participation in the NCJUA’s surplus of $\n16\nmillion for all open years.\nNorth Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association\nThe North Carolina Insurance Underwriting Association (“NCIUA”) provides windstorm and hail coverage as well as homeowners policies for properties located in the state’s beach and coastal areas that insurers are not otherwise willing to insure. All insurers licensed to write\n162      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nresidential and commercial property insurance in North Carolina are members of the NCIUA. Members are assessed in proportion to their North Carolina residential and commercial property insurance writings, which is determined annually and varies by coverage, for plan deficits. As of December 31, 2021, the NCIUA had a surplus of $\n664\nmillion. No member company is entitled to the distribution of any portion of the Association’s surplus. The Company does not recognize any interest related to this surplus. Legislation in 2009 capped insurers’ assessments for losses incurred in any calendar year at $\n1.00\nbillion. Subsequent to an industry assessment of $\n1.00\nbillion, if the plan continues to require funding, it may authorize insurers to assess a\n10\n% catastrophe recovery charge on each property insurance policy statewide to be remitted to the plan.\nOther programs\nThe Company is also subject to assessments by the NCRF and the FHCF, which are described in Note 11.\nGuaranty funds\nUnder state insurance guaranty fund laws, insurers doing business in a state can be assessed, up to prescribed limits, for certain obligations of insolvent insurance companies to policyholders and claimants. Amounts assessed to each company are typically related to its proportion of business written in each state. The Company’s policy is to accrue assessments when the entity for which the insolvency relates has met its state of domicile’s statutory definition of insolvency, the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable and the related premium upon which the assessment is based is written. In most states, the definition is met with a declaration of financial insolvency by a court of competent jurisdiction. In certain states there must also be a final order of liquidation. Since most states allow a credit against premium or other state related taxes for assessments, an asset is recorded based on paid and accrued assessments for the amount the Company expects to recover on the respective state’s tax return and is realized over the period allowed by each state. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the liability balance included in other liabilities and accrued expenses was $\n17\nmillion and $\n9\nmillion, respectively. The related premium tax offsets included in other assets were $\n7\nmillion and $\n8\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nGuarantees\nIn the normal course of business, the Company provides standard indemnifications to contractual counterparties in connection with numerous transactions, including acquisitions and divestitures. The types of indemnifications typically provided include indemnifications for breaches of representations and warranties, taxes and certain other liabilities, such as third-party lawsuits. The indemnification clauses are often standard contractual terms and are entered into in the normal course of business based on an assessment that the risk of loss would be remote. The terms of the indemnifications vary in duration and nature. In many cases, the\nmaximum obligation is not explicitly stated and the contingencies triggering the obligation to indemnify have not occurred and are not expected to occur. Consequently, the maximum amount of the obligation under such indemnifications is not determinable. Historically, the Company has not made any material payments pursuant to these obligations.\nRelated to the sale of ALNY on October 1, 2021, AIC agreed to indemnify Wilton Reassurance Company in connection with certain representations, warranties and covenants of AIC, and certain liabilities specifically excluded from the transaction, subject to specific contractual limitations regarding AIC’s maximum obligation. Management does not believe these indemnifications will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.\nRelated to the sale of ALIC and Allstate Assurance Company on November 1, 2021, AIC and Allstate Financial Insurance Holdings Corporation (collectively, the “Sellers”) agreed to indemnify Everlake US Holdings Company in connection with certain representations, warranties and covenants of the Sellers, and certain liabilities specifically excluded from the transaction, subject to specific contractual limitations regarding the Sellers’ maximum obligation. Management does not believe these indemnifications will have a material effect on results of operations, cash flows or financial position of the Company.\nThe aggregate liability balance related to all guarantees was not material as of December 31, 2021.\nRegulation and compliance\nThe Company is subject to extensive laws, regulations, administrative directives, and regulatory actions. From time to time, regulatory authorities or legislative bodies seek to influence and restrict premium rates, require premium refunds to policyholders, require reinstatement of terminated policies, prescribe rules or guidelines on how affiliates compete in the marketplace, restrict the ability of insurers to cancel or non-renew policies, require insurers to continue to write new policies or limit their ability to write new policies, limit insurers’ ability to change coverage terms or to impose underwriting standards, impose additional regulations regarding agency and broker compensation, regulate the nature of and amount of investments, impose fines and penalties for unintended errors or mistakes, impose additional regulations regarding cybersecurity and privacy, and otherwise expand overall regulation of insurance products and the insurance industry. In addition, the Company is subject to laws and regulations administered and enforced by federal agencies, international agencies, and other organizations, including but not limited to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, and the U.S. Department of Justice. The Company has established procedures and policies to facilitate compliance with laws and regulations, to foster prudent business operations, and to support financial reporting. The\nThe Allstate Corporation      163\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nCompany routinely reviews its practices to validate compliance with laws and regulations and with internal procedures and policies. As a result of these reviews, from time to time the Company may decide to modify some of its procedures and policies. Such modifications, and the reviews that led to them, may be accompanied by payments being made and costs being incurred. The ultimate changes and eventual effects of these actions on the Company’s business, if any, are uncertain.\nLegal and regulatory proceedings and inquiries\nThe Company and certain subsidiaries are involved in a number of lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings arising out of various aspects of its business.\nBackground\nThese matters raise difficult and complicated factual and legal issues and are subject to many uncertainties and complexities, including the underlying facts of each matter; novel legal issues; variations between jurisdictions in which matters are being litigated, heard, or investigated; changes in assigned judges; differences or developments in applicable laws and judicial interpretations; judges reconsidering prior rulings; the length of time before many of these matters might be resolved by settlement, through litigation, or otherwise; adjustments with respect to anticipated trial schedules and other proceedings; developments in similar actions against other companies; the fact that some of the lawsuits are putative class actions in which a class has not been certified and in which the purported class may not be clearly defined; the fact that some of the lawsuits involve multi-state class actions in which the applicable law(s) for the claims at issue is in dispute and therefore unclear; and the challenging legal environment faced by corporations and insurance companies.\nThe outcome of these matters may be affected by decisions, verdicts, and settlements, and the timing of such decisions, verdicts, and settlements, in other individual and class action lawsuits that involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities and by other legal, governmental, and regulatory actions that involve the Company, other insurers, or other entities. The outcome may also be affected by future state or federal legislation, the timing or substance of which cannot be predicted.\nIn the lawsuits, plaintiffs seek a variety of remedies which may include equitable relief in the form of injunctive and other remedies and monetary relief in the form of contractual and extra-contractual damages. In some cases, the monetary damages sought may include punitive or treble damages. Often specific information about the relief sought, such as the amount of damages, is not available because plaintiffs have not requested specific relief in their pleadings. When specific monetary demands are made, they are often set just below a state court jurisdictional limit in order to seek the maximum amount available in state court, regardless of the specifics of the case, while still avoiding the risk of removal to federal court. In Allstate’s experience, monetary demands in\npleadings bear little relation to the ultimate loss, if any, to the Company.\nIn connection with regulatory examinations and proceedings, government authorities may seek various forms of relief, including penalties, restitution, and changes in business practices. The Company may not be advised of the nature and extent of relief sought until the final stages of the examination or proceeding.\nAccrual and disclosure policy\nThe Company reviews its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings on an ongoing basis and follows appropriate accounting guidance when making accrual and disclosure decisions. The Company establishes accruals for such matters at management’s best estimate when the Company assesses that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company does not establish accruals for such matters when the Company does not believe both that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. The Company’s assessment of whether a loss is reasonably possible or probable is based on its assessment of the ultimate outcome of the matter following all appeals. The Company does not include potential recoveries in its estimates of reasonably possible or probable losses. Legal fees are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company continues to monitor its lawsuits, regulatory inquiries, and other legal proceedings for further developments that would make the loss contingency both probable and estimable, and accordingly accruable, or that could affect the amount of accruals that have been previously established. There may continue to be exposure to loss in excess of any amount accrued. Disclosure of the nature and amount of an accrual is made when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the amount of accrual.\nWhen the Company assesses it is reasonably possible or probable that a loss has been incurred, it discloses the matter. When it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for the matters disclosed, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed. Disclosure is not required when an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss cannot be made.\nFor certain of the matters described below in the “Claims related proceedings” and “Other proceedings” subsections, the Company is able to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any. In determining whether it is possible to estimate the reasonably possible loss or range of loss, the Company reviews and evaluates the disclosed matters, in conjunction with counsel, in light of potentially relevant factual and legal developments.\nThese developments may include information learned through the discovery process, rulings on dispositive motions, settlement discussions, information obtained from other sources, experience from managing these and other matters, and other\n164      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nrulings by courts, arbitrators or others. When the Company possesses sufficient appropriate information to develop an estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below. There may be other disclosed matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible, but such an estimate is not possible. Disclosure of the estimate of the reasonably possible loss or range of loss above the amount accrued, if any, for any individual matter would only be considered when there have been sufficient legal and factual developments such that the Company’s ability to resolve the matter would not be impaired by the disclosure of the individual estimate.\nThe Company currently estimates that the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss in excess of the amount accrued, if any, for the disclosed matters where such an estimate is possible is\nzero\nto $\n135\nmillion, pre-tax. This disclosure is not an indication of expected loss, if any. Under accounting guidance, an event is “reasonably possible” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is more than remote but less than likely” and an event is “remote” if “the chance of the future event or events occurring is slight.” This estimate is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment and a variety of assumptions, and known and unknown uncertainties. The matters underlying the estimate will change from time to time, and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate. The estimate does not include matters or losses for which an estimate is not possible. Therefore, this estimate represents an estimate of possible loss only for certain matters meeting these criteria. It does not represent the Company’s maximum possible loss exposure. Information is provided below regarding the nature of all of the disclosed matters and, where specified, the amount, if any, of plaintiff claims associated with these loss contingencies.\nDue to the complexity and scope of the matters disclosed in the “Claims related proceedings” and “Other proceedings” subsections below and the many uncertainties that exist, the ultimate outcome of these matters cannot be predicted and in the Company’s judgment, a loss, in excess of amounts accrued, if any, is not probable. In the event of an unfavorable outcome in one or more of these matters, the ultimate liability may be in excess of amounts currently accrued, if any, and may be material to the Company’s operating results or cash flows for a particular quarterly or annual period. However, based on information currently known to it, management believes that the ultimate outcome of all matters described below, as they are resolved over time, is not likely to have a material effect on the financial position of the Company.\nClaims related proceedings\nThe Company is managing various disputes in Florida that raise challenges to the Company’s practices, processes, and procedures relating to claims for personal injury protection benefits under Florida auto policies. Medical providers continue to pursue litigation under various theories that challenge the amounts that the Company pays under the personal injury protection coverage,\nseeking additional benefit payments, as well as applicable interest, penalties and fees. There is a pending class action,\nRevival Chiropractic v. Allstate Insurance Company, et al.\n(M.D. Fla., filed January 2019; appeal pending, 11th Circuit Court of Appeals), where the court denied class certification and plaintiff’s request to file a renewed motion for class certification. The Company is also defending litigation involving individual plaintiffs.\nThe Company is defending putative class actions in various courts that raise challenges to the Company’s depreciation practices in homeowner property claims. In these lawsuits, plaintiffs generally allege that, when calculating actual cash value, the costs of “non-materials” such as labor, general contractor’s overhead and profit, and sales tax should not be subject to depreciation. The Company is currently defending the following lawsuits on this issue:\nPerry v. Allstate Indemnity Company, et al.\n(N.D. Ohio, filed May 2016);\nLado v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company\n(S.D. Ohio, filed March 2020);\nManiaci v. Allstate Insurance Company\n(N.D. Ohio, filed March 2020);\nFerguson-Luke, et al. v. Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n(N.D. Ohio, filed April 2020);\nClark v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company\n(Circuit Court of Independence Co., Ark., filed February 2016); and\nMitchell, et al. v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company, et al.\n(S.D. Ala., filed August 2021). No classes have been certified in these matters. A settlement has been reached in\nHuey v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company\n(N.D. Miss., filed October 2019), and a settlement-in-principle has been reached in\nThaxton v. Allstate Indemnity Company\n(Madison Co., Ill., filed July 2020); and\nHester v. Allstate Vehicle and Property Insurance Company\n(St. Clair Co., Ill., filed 2020).\nThe Company is defending putative class actions pending in multiple states alleging that the Company underpays total loss vehicle physical damage claims on auto policies. The allegedly systematic underpayments result from one or more of the following theories: (a) the third party valuation tool used by the Company as part of a comprehensive adjustment process is allegedly flawed, biased, or contrary to applicable law; (b) the Company allegedly does not pay sales tax, title fees, registration fees, and/or other specified fees that are allegedly mandatory under policy language or state legal authority; or (c) after paying for the value of the loss vehicle, then the Company allegedly is not entitled to retain the residual salvage value, and the Company allegedly must pay salvage value to the owner (or if the loss vehicle is retained by the owner, then the Company allegedly may not apply any offset for the salvage value).\nThe following cases are currently pending against the Company:\nOlberg v. Allstate Insurance Company, Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company, and CCC Information Services, Inc\n. (W.D. Wash., filed April 2018);\nBloomgarden v. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n(S.D. Fla., filed July 2018, dismissed August 2019, refiled on September 2019, remanded to 17th Judicial Circuit, Broward Co. October 2020);\nErby v. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n(E.D. Pa.,\nThe Allstate Corporation      165\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nfiled October 2018);\nKronenberg v. Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n(E.D.N.Y., filed December 2018);\nDurgin v. Allstate Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n(W.D. La., filed June 7, 2019);\nSaad v. National General Insurance Company\n(Superior Ct., Los Angeles Co., Cal., filed May 2020);\nWilliams v. Esurance Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n(C.D. Cal., filed September 2020);\nCotton v. Allstate Fire and Casualty Insurance Company\n(Cir. Ct. of Cook Co. Ill., Chancery Div., filed October 2020);\nRomaniak v. Esurance Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n(N.D. Ohio, filed December 2020);\nRawlins v. Esurance Property and Casualty Insurance Company\n(E.D. Mo., filed February 2021).\nNone of the courts in any of the pending matters has ruled on class certification.\nOther proceedings\nThe Company is defending against an investigatory hearing before the California Insurance Commissioner concerning the private passenger automobile insurance rating practices of Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company in California. The investigatory hearing is captioned:\nIn the Matter of the Rating Practices of Allstate Insurance Company and Allstate Indemnity Company.\nPursuant to the Notice of Hearing issued by the California Insurance Commissioner, the California Insurance Commissioner is investigating: (1) whether Allstate has potentially violated California insurance law by using illegal price optimization; (2) how Allstate implemented any such potentially illegal price optimization in its private passenger auto insurance rates and/or class plans; and (3) how such potentially illegal price optimization impacted Allstate’s private passenger auto insurance policyholders. Fact discovery has been completed in the investigatory hearing and an administrative hearing is scheduled to begin on May 10, 2022.\nThe stockholder derivative actions described below are disclosed pursuant to SEC disclosure requirements for these types of matters. The putative class action alleging violations of the federal securities laws is disclosed because it involves similar allegations to those made in the stockholder derivative actions.\nBiefeldt / IBEW\nConsolidated Action. Two separately filed stockholder derivative actions have been consolidated into a single proceeding that is pending in the Circuit Court for Cook County, Illinois, Chancery Division. The original complaint in the first-filed of those actions,\nBiefeldt v. Wilson, et al.\n, was filed on August 3, 2017, in that court by a plaintiff alleging that she is a stockholder of the Company. On June 29, 2018, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss that complaint for failure to make a pre-suit demand on the Allstate Board but granted plaintiff permission to file an amended complaint. The original complaint in\nIBEW Local No. 98 Pension Fund v. Wilson, et al.\n, was filed on April 12, 2018, in the same court by another plaintiff alleging to be a stockholder of the Company. After the court issued its dismissal decision in the\nBiefeldt\naction, plaintiffs agreed to consolidate the two actions and filed a consolidated amended complaint\nnaming as defendants the Company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, its former president, and certain present or former members of the Allstate Board. In that complaint, plaintiffs allege that the directors and officer defendants breached their fiduciary duties to the Company in connection with allegedly material misstatements or omissions concerning the Company’s automobile insurance claim frequency statistics and the reasons f\nor a claim frequency increase for Allstate brand auto in\nsurance between October 2014 and August 3, 2015. The factual allegations are substantially similar to those at issue in\nIn re The Allstate Corp. Securities Litigation\n. Plaintiffs further allege that a senior officer and several outside directors engaged in stock option exercises allegedly while in possession of material nonpublic information. Plaintiffs seek, on behalf of the Company, an unspecified amount of damages and various forms of equitable relief. Defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint on September 24, 2018 for failure to make a demand on the Allstate Board. On May 14, 2019, the court granted defendants’ motion to dismiss the complaint, but allowed plaintiffs leave to file a second consolidated amended complaint which they filed on September 17, 2019. Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on November 1, 2019 for failure to make a demand on the Allstate Board. The court subsequently requested supplemental briefing on the motion which concluded on February 1, 2021. On February 24, 2021, the court dismissed the second amended consolidated complaint with prejudice. Plaintiffs appealed and the court held a hearing on February 8, 2022. The Company awaits the court’s decision.\nIn\nSundquist v. Wilson, et al\n., another plaintiff alleging to be a stockholder of the Company filed a stockholder derivative complaint in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on May 21, 2018. Plaintiff seeks, on behalf of the Company, an unspecified amount of damages and various forms of equitable relief. The complaint names as defendants the Company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, its former president, its former vice chairman, and certain present or former members of the board of directors.\nThe complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty based on allegations similar to those asserted in\nIn re The\nAllstate Corp. Securities Litigation\nas well as state law “misappropriation” claims based on stock option transactions by the Company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, its former vice chairman, and certain members of the board of directors. Defendants moved to dismiss and/or stay the complaint on August 7, 2018. On December 4, 2018, the court granted defendants’ motion and stayed the case pending the final resolution of the consolidated\nBiefeldt/IBEW\nmatter.\nMims v. Wilson, et al.,\nis an additional stockholder derivative action filed on February 12, 2020 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. Plaintiff alleges that she previously made a demand on the Allstate Board and seeks, on behalf of the Company, an unspecified amount of damages and\n166      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nvarious forms of equitable relief. The complaint names as defendants the Company’s chairman, president and chief executive officer, its former president, its former vice chairman, and certain present or former members of the Allstate Board. The complaint alleges breaches of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment based on allegations similar to those asserted in\nIn re The Allstate Corp. Securities Litigation\n. On February 20, 2020, the Allstate Board appointed a special committee to investigate the allegations in plaintiff’s demand. The Company moved to dismiss the complaint on August 24, 2020 and on December 8, 2020, the court granted defendants’ motion, and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On January 5, 2021, plaintiff filed a motion to alter the judgment and requested leave to file an amended complaint and defendants opposed the motion. On February 10, 2021, the court denied plaintiff’s motion to alter the judgment. No appeal was filed.\nIn\nre The Allstate Corp. Securities Litigation\nis a certified class action filed on November 11, 2016 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois against the Company and two of its officers asserting claims under the federal securities laws. Plaintiffs allege that they purchased Allstate common stock during the class period and suffered damages as the result of the conduct alleged. Plaintiffs seek an unspecified amount of damages, costs, attorney’s fees, and other relief as the court deems appropriate. Plaintiffs allege that the Company and certain senior officers made allegedly material misstatements or omissions concerning claim frequency statistics and the reasons for a claim frequency increase for Allstate brand auto insurance between October 2014 and August 3, 2015.\nPlaintiffs further allege that a senior officer engaged in stock option exercises during that time allegedly while in possession of material nonpublic information about Allstate brand auto insurance claim frequency. The Company, its chairman, president and chief executive officer, and its former president are the named defendants. After the court denied their motion to dismiss on February 27, 2018, defendants answered the complaint, denying plaintiffs’ allegations that there was any misstatement or omission or other misconduct. On June 22, 2018, plaintiffs filed their motion for class certification. The court allowed the lead plaintiffs to amend their complaint to add the City of Providence Employee Retirement System as a proposed class representative and on September 12, 2018, the amended complaint was filed. On March 26, 2019, the court granted plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and certified a class consisting of all persons who purchased Allstate common stock between October 29, 2014 and August 3, 2015. On April 9, 2019, defendants filed with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit a petition for permission to appeal this ruling and the Seventh Circuit granted that petition on April 25, 2019. On July 16, 2020, the Seventh Circuit vacated the class certification order and remanded the matter for further consideration by the district court. Discovery in this matter concluded on October 5, 2020. On December 21, 2020, the district court again granted plaintiffs’ motion for class\ncertification and certified a class consisting of all persons who purchased Allstate common stock between October 29, 2014 and August 3, 2015. On January 4, 2021, defendants filed with the Seventh Circuit a petition for permission to appeal this ruling. The petition was denied on January 28, 2021. On January 10, 2022, the magistrate judge denied the parties’\nDaubert\nchallenges in all material aspects. The court held a status conference on February 1, 2022 and set a schedule for summary judgment briefing to commence on March 23, 2022.\nThe Company is continuing to defend\ntwo\nputative class actions in California federal court,\nHolland Hewitt v. Allstate Life Insurance Company\n(E.D. Cal., filed May 2020) and\nFarley v. Lincoln Benefit Life\nCompany\n(E.D. Cal., filed Dec. 2020), following the sale of ALIC. No classes have been certified in these matters. The Company is also defending an individual action in California state court,\nGilmore v. Lincoln Benefit Life Company\n(San Diego Co., Cal., filed October 29, 2021). In these cases, plaintiffs generally allege that the defendants failed to comply with certain California statutes which address contractual grace periods and lapse notice requirements for certain life insurance policies. Plaintiffs claim that these statutes apply to life insurance policies that existed before the statutes’ effective date. The plaintiffs seek damages and injunctive relief. Similar litigation is pending against other insurance carriers. In August 2021, the California Supreme Court in\nMcHugh v. Protective Life\n, a matter involving another insurer, determined that the statutory notice requirements apply to life insurance policies issued before the statutes’ effective date. The Company asserts various defenses to plaintiffs’ claims and to class certification.\nThe Allstate Corporation      167\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Company and its domestic subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return. Tax liabilities and benefits realized by the consolidated group are allocated as generated by the respective entities.\nDeferred income taxes result from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in future years. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through income tax expense as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted.\nThe Company qualified and claimed certain employer payroll tax credits that are allowed under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. For the year ended December 31, 2021, the Company recorded $\n21\nmillion of refundable employee retention tax credit reported in property and casualty claims and claims expense in the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRegulatory tax examinations\nOn January 4, 2021 and October 1, 2021, the Company acquired National General and SafeAuto, respectively. For tax years prior to the acquisition, National General and SafeAuto are subject to separate Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audits. The IRS has completed its exam of Allstate’s tax years prior to 2017, National General tax years prior to 2016, and SafeAuto’s tax years prior to 2018. Currently, the Company is under exam for the 2017 and 2018 tax years and National General is under exam for the 2016, 2017, and 2018 tax years. Any adjustments that may result from IRS examinations of the Company’s tax returns are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nUnrecognized tax benefits\nThe Company recognizes tax positions in the consolidated financial statements only when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination by the relevant taxing authority based on the technical merits of the position. A position that meets this standard is measured at the largest amount of benefit that will more likely than not be realized on settlement. A liability is established for differences between positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements.\nThe Company believes that the unrecognized tax benefits balance will not materially change within the next twelve months.\n168      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nAs of December 31, 2021, the Company has U.S. federal and foreign net operating loss (“NOL”) carryforwards, some of which will expire on various dates from 2024 through 2037 as indicated in the table below. In assessing the realizability of gross deferred tax assets, management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the gross deferred tax assets will not be realized. Management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities, projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment, as well as limitations on use in future periods. Accordingly, management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain NOL carryforwards from recent acquisitions will not be realized. The Company had a valuation allowance of $\n24\nmillion on the deferred tax assets related to these NOL carryforwards.\nThe provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 eliminated the 20-year carryforward period and made it indefinite for federal net operating losses generated in tax years after December 31, 2017. For such amounts generated prior to 2018, the 20-year carryforward period continues to apply.\nThe Company paid income taxes of $\n1.05\nbillion, $\n1.48\nbillion and $\n648\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Company had current income tax receivable of $\n370\nmillion and payable of $\n55\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe Allstate Corporation      169\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nAllstate’s domestic property and casualty and life insurance subsidiaries prepare their statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with accounting practices prescribed or permitted by the insurance department of the applicable state of domicile. Prescribed statutory accounting practices include a variety of publications of the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”), as well as state laws, regulations and general administrative rules. Permitted statutory accounting practices encompass all accounting practices not so prescribed.\nAll states require domiciled insurance companies to prepare statutory-basis financial statements in conformity with the NAIC Accounting Practices and Procedures Manual, subject to any deviations prescribed or permitted by the applicable insurance commissioner or director. Statutory accounting practices differ from GAAP primarily since they require charging policy acquisition costs to expense as incurred, establishing life insurance reserves based on different actuarial assumptions, and valuing certain investments and establishing deferred taxes on a different basis.\nDividend Limitations\nThere are no regulatory restrictions that limit the payment of dividends by the Corporation, except those generally applicable to corporations incorporated in Delaware. Dividends are payable only out of certain components of shareholders’ equity as permitted by Delaware law. However, the ability of the Corporation to pay dividends is dependent on business conditions, income, cash requirements of the Company, receipt of dividends from AIC and other relevant factors.\nThe payment of shareholder dividends by AIC without the prior approval of the Illinois Department of Insurance (“IL DOI”) is limited to formula amounts based on net income and capital and surplus, determined in conformity with statutory accounting practices, as well as the timing and amount of dividends paid in the preceding twelve months. AIC paid dividends of $\n5.95\nbillion in 2021. The maximum amount of dividends AIC will be able to pay without prior IL DOI approval at a given point in time during 2022 is $\n5.51\nbillion, less dividends paid during the preceding twelve months measured at that point in time. The payment of a dividend in excess of this amount requires\n30\ndays advance written notice to the IL DOI. The dividend is deemed approved, unless the IL DOI disapproves it within the\n30\n-day notice period. Additionally, any dividend must be paid out of unassigned surplus excluding unrealized appreciation from investments, which for AIC totaled $\n12.72\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, and cannot result in capital and surplus being less than the minimum amount required by law.\nUnder state insurance laws, insurance companies are required to maintain paid up capital of not less than the minimum capital requirement applicable to the types of insurance they are authorized to write. Insurance companies are also subject to risk-based capital (“RBC”) requirements adopted by state\ninsurance regulators. A company’s “authorized control level RBC” is calculated using various factors applied to certain financial balances and activity. Companies that do not maintain adjusted statutory capital and surplus at a level in excess of the company action level RBC, which is\ntwo\ntimes authorized control level RBC, are required to take specified actions. Company action level RBC is significantly in excess of the minimum capital requirements. Total adjusted statutory capital and surplus and authorized control level RBC of AIC were $\n18.43\nbillion and $\n2.90\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021. Most of the Corporation’s insurance subsidiaries are subsidiaries of or reinsure all of their business to AIC. AIC’s subsidiaries are included as a component of AIC’s total statutory capital and surplus.\nThe amount of restricted net assets, as represented by the Corporation’s investment in its insurance subsidiaries, was $\n27.72\nbillion as of December 31, 2021.\nIntercompany transactions\nNotification and approval of intercompany lending activities is also required by the IL DOI for transactions that exceed a level that is based on a formula using statutory admitted assets and statutory surplus.\n170      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nPension and other postretirement plans\nDefined benefit pension plans cover most full-time employees, certain part-time employees and employee-agents. Benefits under the pension plans are based upon the employee’s length of service, eligible annual compensation and, prior to January 1, 2014, either a cash balance or final average pay formula. A cash balance formula applies to all eligible employees hired after August 1, 2002. Eligible employees hired before August 1, 2002 chose between the cash balance formula and the final average pay formula. In July 2013, the Company amended its primary plans effective January 1, 2014 to introduce a new cash balance formula to replace the previous formulas (including the final average pay formula and the previous cash balance formula) under which eligible employees accrue benefits. The Company merged\ntwo\nof its qualified pension plans effective March 31, 2019.\nThe Company also provides a medical coverage subsidy for eligible employees hired before January 1, 2003, including their eligible dependents, when they retire and certain life insurance benefits for eligible retirees (“postretirement benefits”). Effective January 1, 2021, the Company eliminated the medical coverage subsidy for employees who were not eligible to retire as of December 31, 2020.\nQualified employees may become eligible for a medical subsidy if they retire in accordance with the terms of the applicable plans and are insured under the Company’s group plans or other approved plans in accordance with the plan’s participation requirements. The Company shares the cost of retiree medical benefits with non Medicare-eligible retirees based on years of service, with the Company’s share being subject to a\n5\n% limit on future annual medical cost inflation after retirement. For Medicare-eligible retirees, the Company provides a fixed Company contribution based on years of service and other factors, which is not subject to adjustments for inflation.\nIn July 2013, the Company amended the plan to eliminate the life insurance benefits effective January 1, 2014 for current eligible employees and effective January 1, 2016 for eligible retirees who retired after 1989. Subject to a court order, the Company paid life insurance premiums for certain retiree plaintiffs until their lawsuit seeking to keep their life insurance benefits intact was resolved. In September 2020, the court entered summary judgment in favor of the Company and dismissed the action, releasing the Company from the order requiring the continued payment of premiums for certain retirees. In December 2021, the Court of Appeals affirmed summary judgment in favor of the Company. In January 2022, the remaining plaintiffs signaled they will appeal to U.S. Supreme Court.\nThe Company has reserved the right to modify or terminate its benefit plans at any time and for any reason.\nObligations and funded status\nThe Company calculates benefit obligations based upon generally accepted actuarial methodologies using the projected benefit obligation (“PBO”) for pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (“APBO”) for other postretirement plans. Pension costs and other postretirement obligations are determined using a December 31 measurement date. The benefit obligations represent the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed to employee service rendered as of the measurement date. The PBO is measured using the pension benefit formulas and assumptions. A plan’s funded status is calculated as the difference between the benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets. The Company’s funding policy for the pension plans is to make contributions at a level in accordance with regulations under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”) and generally accepted actuarial principles. The Company’s other postretirement benefit plans are not funded.\nThe Allstate Corporation      171\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n(1)\nThe funded status is recorded within other assets or other liabilities and accrued expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.\nThe prior service credit is recognized as a component of net cost for pension and other postretirement plans amortized over the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation (“ABO”) for all defined benefit pension plans was $\n6.36\nbillion and $\n7.55\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The ABO is the actuarial present value of all benefits attributed by the pension benefit formula\nto employee service rendered at the measurement date. However, it differs from the PBO due to the\nexclusion of an assumption as to future compensation levels.\nThe PBO, ABO and fair value of plan assets for the Company’s pension plans with an ABO in excess of plan assets were $\n123\nmillion, $\n121\nmillion and\nzero\n, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 and $\n7.33\nbillion, $\n7.13\nbillion and $\n6.56\nbillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2020. Included in the accrued benefit cost of the pension benefits are certain unfunded non-qualified plans with accrued benefit costs of $\n123\nmillion and $\n139\nmillion for 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n172      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe service cost component is the actuarial present value of the benefits attributed by the plans’ benefit formula to services rendered by the employees during the period.\nInterest cost is the increase in the PBO in the period due to the passage of time at the discount rate.\nInterest cost fluctuates as the discount rate changes and is also impacted by the related change in the size of the PBO.\nThe expected return on plan assets is determined as the product of the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the fair value of plan assets.\nPension and other postretirement service cost, interest cost, expected return on plan assets, amortization of prior service credit and curtailment gains and losses are reported in property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, operating costs and expenses, net investment income and (if applicable) restructuring and related charges on the Consolidated Statements of Operations.\nRemeasurement gains and losses relate to changes in discount rates, the differences between actual return on plan assets and the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, and differences between actual plan experience and actuarial assumptions.\nThe weighted average health care cost trend rate used in measuring the accumulated postretirement benefit cost is\n6.6\n% for 2022, gradually declining to\n4.5\n% in 2035 and remaining at that level thereafter.\nPension plan assets\nIn general, the Company’s pension plan assets are managed in accordance with investment policies approved by pension investment committees. The purpose of the policies is to ensure the plans’ long-term ability to meet benefit obligations by prudently investing plan assets and Company contributions, while taking into consideration regulatory and legal requirements and current market conditions. The investment policies are reviewed periodically and specify target plan asset allocation by\nasset category. In addition, the policies specify various asset allocation and other risk limits. The target asset allocation takes the plans’ funding status into consideration, among other factors, including anticipated demographic changes or liquidity requirements that may affect the funding status such as the potential impact of lump sum settlements as well as existing or expected market conditions. In general, the allocation has a lower overall investment risk when a plan is in a stronger funded status position since there is less economic incentive to take risk to increase the expected returns on the plan assets. The pension plans’ asset exposure within each asset category is tracked against widely accepted\nThe Allstate Corporation      173\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nestablished benchmarks for each asset class with limits on variation from the benchmark established in the investment policy. Pension plan assets are regularly\nmonitored for compliance with these limits and other risk limits specified in the investment policies.\n(1)\nThe target asset allocation considers risk-based exposure while the actual percentage of plan assets utilizes a financial reporting view excluding exposure provided through derivatives.\n(2)\nThe actual percentage of plan assets for equity securities includes\n3\n% and\n1\n% of fixed income mutual funds in 2021 and 2020, respectively, that are subject to the fixed income securities target allocation.\n(3)\nSecurities lending collateral reinvestment of $\n121\nmillion and $\n101\nmillion is excluded from the table above in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe target asset allocation for an asset category may be achieved either through direct investment holdings, through replication using derivative instruments (e.g., futures or swaps) or net of hedges using derivative instruments to reduce exposure to an asset category. The net notional amount of derivatives used for replication and non-hedging strategies is limited to\n115\n% of total plan assets. Market performance of the different asset categories may, from time to time, cause deviation from the target\nasset allocation. The asset allocation mix is reviewed on a periodic basis and rebalanced to bring the allocation within the target ranges.\nOutside the target asset allocation, the pension plans participate in a securities lending program to enhance returns. As of December 31, 2021, fixed income securities are lent out and cash collateral is invested in short-term investments.\n174      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\n(1)\nIncludes U.S. government and agencies and foreign government bonds.\n(2)\nThe securities lending obligation represents the plan’s obligation to return securities lending collateral received under a securities lending program. The terms of the program allow both the plan and the counterparty the right and ability to redeem/return the securities loaned on short notice. Due to its relatively short-term nature, the outstanding balance of the obligation approximates fair value.\n(3)\nOther net plan assets represent cash and cash equivalents, interest and dividends receivable and net receivables related to settlements of investment transactions, such as purchases and sales.\nThe fair values of pension plan assets are estimated using the same methodologies and inputs as those used to determine the fair values for the respective asset category of the Company. These methodologies and inputs are disclosed in Note 6.\nThe Allstate Corporation      175\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe expected long-term rate of return on plan assets reflects the average rate of earnings expected on plan assets. The Company’s assumption for the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets is evaluated annually giving consideration to appropriate data including, but not limited to, the plan asset allocation, forward-looking expected returns for the period over which benefits will be paid, historical returns on plan assets and other relevant market data. Given the long-term forward-looking nature of this assumption, the actual returns in any one year do not immediately result in a change to the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets. In consideration of the targeted plan asset allocation, the Company evaluated expected returns using sources including historical average asset class returns from independent nationally recognized providers of this type of data blended together using the asset allocation policy weights for the Company’s pension plans; asset class return forecasts developed by employees with relevant expertise in such forecasts and who are independent from those charged with managing the pension plan assets; and expected portfolio returns from a proprietary simulation methodology of a widely recognized external\ninvestment consulting firm that performs asset allocation and actuarial services for corporate pension plan sponsors. The above sources support the Company’s weighted average long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption of\n7.06\n% used for 2021 and an estimate of\n7.06\n% that will be used for 2022. As of the 2021 measurement date, the arithmetic average of the annual actual return on plan assets for the most recent\n10\nand\n5\nyears was\n11.7\n% and\n15.0\n%, respectively.\nCash flows\nThere was no required cash contribution necessary to satisfy the minimum funding requirement under the IRC for the tax qualified pension plan for the year ended December 31, 2021.\nThe Company currently plans to contribute $\n24\nmillion to its unfunded non-qualified plans and\nzero\nto both its primary and other qualified funded pension plans in 2022.\nThe Company contributed $\n27\nmillion and $\n23\nmillion to the postretirement benefit plans in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contributions by participants were $\n16\nmillion and $\n14\nmillion in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n176      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nAllstate 401(k) Savings Plan\nEmployees of the Company, with the exception of those employed by the Company’s international, SquareTrade and InfoArmor subsidiaries, are eligible to become members of the Allstate 401(k) Savings Plan (“Allstate Plan”). The Company’s contributions are based on the Company’s matching obligation. The Company is responsible for funding its contribution to the Allstate Plan.\nThe Company’s contribution to the Allstate Plan was $\n110\nmillion, $\n103\nmillion and $\n93\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. In 2019, the amount was reduced by $\n41\nmillion of ESOP benefit. Prior to 2020, the Allstate Plan had a leveraged ESOP to fund a portion of the contribution. The ESOP note matured on December 31, 2019.\nAllstate’s Canadian, SquareTrade and InfoArmor subsidiaries sponsor defined contribution plans for their eligible employees. Expense for subsidiary sponsored defined contribution plans was $\n9\nmillion, $\n13\nmillion and $\n15\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Allstate Corporation      177\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe Company currently has equity incentive plans under which it grants nonqualified stock options, restricted stock units and performance stock awards to certain employees and directors of the Company.\nThe Company records compensation expense related to awards under these plans over the shorter of the period in which the requisite service is rendered or retirement eligibility is attained. Compensation expense for performance stock awards with no market condition is based on the probable number of awards expected to vest using the performance level most likely to be achieved at the end of the performance period. Compensation expense for performance stock awards with a market condition is based on the number of awards expected to vest as estimated at the grant date and does not change if the market condition is not met.\nOptions are granted to employees with exercise prices equal to the closing share price of the Company’s common stock on the applicable grant date. Options granted to employees vest ratably over a\nthree-year\nperiod.  Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who are retirement eligible and in certain other limited circumstances. Options may be exercised once vested and will expire no later than\nten years\nafter the date of grant.\nRestricted stock units for directors vest immediately and convert into shares of stock on the earlier of the day of the third anniversary of the grant date or the date the director’s service terminates, unless a deferred period of restriction is elected.\nRestricted stock units granted to directors prior to June 1, 2016 convert upon leaving the board. Restricted stock units granted to employees prior to February 19, 2020 vest on the day prior to the third anniversary of the grant date. Restricted stock units granted to employees on or after February 19, 2020 vest ratably over a\nthree-year\nperiod. Restricted stock units granted to employees subsequently convert into shares of stock on the day of the respective anniversary of the grant date. Vesting is subject to continued service, except for employees who are retirement eligible and in certain other limited circumstances.\nPerformance stock awards vest into shares of stock based on achieving established company-specific performance goals. Performance stock awards granted prior to February 19, 2020 vest into shares of stock on the day prior to the third anniversary of the grant date. Performance stock awards granted on or after February 19, 2020 vest into shares of stock on the third anniversary of the grant date.\nThe numbers of shares earned upon vesting of the performance stock awards is based on the attainment of performance goals for each of the performance periods, subject to continued service, except for employees who are retirement eligible and in certain other limited circumstances.\nSince 2001, a total of\n110.8\nmillion shares of common stock were authorized to be used for awards under the plans, subject to adjustment in accordance with the plans’ terms. As of December 31, 2021,\n17.0\nmillion shares were reserved and remained available for future issuance under these plans. The Company uses its treasury shares for these issuances.\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated on the date of grant using a binomial lattice model. The Company uses historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination within the valuation model. In addition, separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes. The expected term of options granted is derived from the output of the binomial lattice model and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding. The expected volatility of the price of the underlying shares is implied based on traded options and historical volatility of the Company’s common stock. The expected dividends were based on the current dividend yield of the Company’s stock as of the date of the grant. The risk-free rate for periods within the contractual life of the option is based on the U.S. Treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant.\n178      www.allstate.com\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n2021 Form 10-K\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of options granted was $\n15.61\n, $\n18.17\nand $\n14.96\nduring 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The intrinsic value, which is the difference between the fair value and the exercise price, of options exercised was $\n112\nmillion, $\n119\nmillion and $\n114\nmillion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe fair value of restricted stock units is based on the market value of the Company’s stock as of the date of the grant. The market value in part reflects the payment of future dividends expected. The weighted average grant date fair value of restricted stock units granted was $\n108.99\n, $\n118.61\nand $\n92.97\nduring 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The total fair value of restricted stock units vested was $\n35\nmillion, $\n32\nmillion and $\n29\nmillion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThe Allstate Corporation      179\n2021 Form 10-K\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nThe change in performance stock awards comprises those initially granted in 2021 and the adjustment to previously granted performance stock awards for performance achievement.\nThe fair value of performance stock awards that do not include a market condition is based on the market value of the Company’s stock as of the date of the grant.\nStarting with the February 2020 award, the fair value of performance stock awards includes a component with market-based condition measured on the grant date using a Monte Carlo simulation model. Market-based condition measures the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) relative to the TSR of peer companies, expressed in terms of the Company’s TSR percentile rank among the peer companies, over a three-calendar-year performance period. The Monte Carlo simulation model uses a risk-neutral framework to model future stock price movements based upon the risk-free rate of return at the time of grant,\nvolatilities of the Company and the peer companies, and expected term assumed to be equal to the remaining measurement period. The market value in part reflects the payment of future dividends expected.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the 2021 performance stock awards with market-based condition assumes a risk-free rate of\n0.2\n%, volatility of\n29.9\n%, average peer volatility of\n37.4\n% and an expected term of\n2.9\nyears.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of performance stock awards granted was $\n107.14\n, $\n123.48\nand $\n92.49\nduring 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

We also have audited the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control – Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”).\nIn our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the COSO.\nBasis for Opinions\nThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying\nItem 9A. Controls and Procedures\n. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n182      www.allstate.com\n2021 Form 10-K\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\nReserve for Property and Casualty Insurance Claims and Claims Expense - Refer to Notes 2 and 9 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nAs of December 31, 2021, the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense was $33.06 billion. The Company establishes reserves for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense on reported and unreported claims of insured losses. Using established industry and actuarial best practices as well as the Company’s historical claims experience, the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense is estimated based on (i) claims reported, (ii) claims incurred but not reported, and (iii) projections of claim payments to be made in the future.\nGiven the subjectivity of estimating claims incurred but not reported and projections of claim payments to be made in the future, particularly those with payout requirements over a longer period of time, the related audit effort in evaluating the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including involvement of our actuarial specialists.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur principal audit procedures related to the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense included the following:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls related to the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, including those over the Company’s estimates and projections.\n•\nWe evaluated the methods and assumptions used by the Company to estimate the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense by:\n–\nTesting the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were complete and accurate.\n–\nComparing the Company’s prior year assumptions of expected development and ultimate loss to actual losses incurred during the year to assess the reasonableness of those assumptions, including consideration of potential bias, in the determination of the reserve for property and casualty claims and claims expense.\n–\nWith the assistance of our actuarial specialists, we developed independent estimates for the reserve for property and casualty insurance claims and claims expense, particularly related to those with payout requirements over a longer period of time, utilizing loss data and industry claim development factors, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.\nNational General Acquisition - Refer to Notes 2 and 3 to the Financial Statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company completed the acquisition of National General Holdings Corp. (“National General”) on January 4, 2021 for approximately $4 billion in cash. The Company accounted for the acquisition of National General under the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations. Accordingly, the purchase price was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values, including distribution and customer relationship intangible assets of $795 million. Management estimated the fair value of such intangible assets using an income approach that considered cash flows expected to be generated by the acquired relationships, a weighted-average cost of capital discount rate reflecting the relative risk of achieving the anticipated cash flows, profits, the time value of money and other relevant inputs, which required management to make significant estimates and assumptions. Changes in the assumptions could impact the amount allocated to acquired intangible assets and ultimately the amount recorded as goodwill.\nGiven the fair value determination of distribution and customer relationship intangible assets requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding projected cash flows and discount rates, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of those estimates and assumptions required a high degree of auditor judgment, and an increased extent of effort, including involving fair value specialists.\nThe Allstate Corporation      183\n2021 Form 10-K\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the fair value of distribution and customer relationship intangible assets acquired from National General included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the valuation methodology used for these acquired intangible assets, including management’s controls over assumptions used in developing estimated future cash flows, and discount rates used to present value cash flows.\n•\nWe assessed the knowledge, skill, ability and objectivity of management’s valuation specialist and evaluated the work performed.\n•\nWe assessed the reasonableness of management’s forecasts by comparing the projection to historical cash flow results of National General, as well as to certain peer companies of National General. We also performed sensitivity analyses to evaluate the impact of changes in assumptions to the valuation of the customer relationship intangible assets.\n•\nWith the assistance of fair value specialists, we evaluated:\n▪\nThe reasonableness of the valuation methodology, and\n▪\nThe reasonableness of the discount rate used to present value the expected cash flows by:\n–\nTesting the source information underlying the determination of the discount rate and testing mathematical accuracy of the calculation.\n–\nDeveloping a range of independent estimates and comparing those to the discount rate selected by management to evaluate the inputs used in the calculation.\n•\nWe evaluated whether the estimated cash flows were consistent with evidence obtained in other areas of the audit.\n•\nWe tested the accuracy and evaluated the relevance of the data used by management on the date of the acquisition.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nChicago, Illinois\nFebruary 18, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1992.\n184      www.allstate.com\n2021 Form 10-K"
