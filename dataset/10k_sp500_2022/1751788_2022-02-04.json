Board of Directors (\"Board\"), is visible to all employees and is built into digital dashboards that include actual injury information for every Dow location around the world.\nAs part of the Company’s total worker health strategy, employees have access to occupational health services at no cost through on-site, Company-managed clinics at its manufacturing locations or an offsite provider overseen by Dow Occupational Health. In addition to access for occupational health needs, the Company also has a comprehensive well-being strategy, which is framed across four dimensions – physical, mental, community and financial well-being – for an approach that is holistic, global, employee centered and outcome-driven. Key ambitions across the four dimensions focus on elements such as workplace stress, psychological safety, resiliency, workload, healthy eating and activities, and social community and inclusion opportunities.\n17\nDow maintains active Crisis Management Teams at the corporate level and in each region where the Company operates to ensure appropriate plans are in place in the event of natural disasters or other emergencies, and currently in response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic. For additional information on the Company’s response to the COVID-19 pandemic, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nInclusion, Diversity & Equity\nAt Dow, inclusion, diversity and equity (“ID&E”) is a business imperative evidenced by inclusion serving as a core pillar of the Company's ambition statement. A strategic and intentional focus on ID&E not only enhances the employee experience and satisfaction, but it also supports innovation, customer experience and understanding of the communities the Company serves. In 2021, Dow ranked #19 in the DiversityInc Top 50 Companies for Diversity and for the first time was named to the\nFortune\n100 Best Companies to Work For\n®\nlist. These are significant accomplishments that represent only two of the many awards the Company received related to its efforts in ID&E.\nDow's strategic ID&E efforts are directed by its Chief Inclusion Officer and Office of Inclusion, which supports implementation throughout Dow’s businesses, functions and regions. Three Inclusion Councils drive the ID&E strategy from the top of the Company down and across the enterprise:\n•\nThe President’s Inclusion Council defines and supports Dow's ID&E strategy from the top.\n•\nA Senior Leaders’ Inclusion Council influences change through senior and mid-level business, geographic and functional leaders.\n•\nA Joint Inclusion Council collaborates to drive maximum employee engagement through Employee Resource Group (“ERG”) leadership.\nDow’s 10 ERGs are representative of the Company’s diverse workforce and help foster an inclusive workplace. Dow’s ERGs are organized around historically underrepresented groups including women, people of color, LGBTQ+ individuals, people with disabilities and veterans, as well as groups both for professionals who are new to the Company and those who are 50 years or older. Senior leaders serve as executive sponsors for each ERG. In 2021, 52 percent of Dow’s workforce and 97 percent of Dow people leaders participated in at least one ERG. Also in 2021, Dow implemented a new Paid Time Off Policy, which provides employees time off to volunteer and engage in ERG activities.\nInclusion and diversity metrics, including ERG participation, global representation of women and U.S. ethnic minority representation in the United States, are published internally on a quarterly basis, are embedded in the same scorecard where Dow’s financial and safety results are measured and are directly connected to leaders’ annual performance and compensation. This data is reviewed regularly by management and with the Compensation and Leadership Development Committee of the Board.\nGlobal pay disparity studies have been conducted at Dow for over 20 years to assess fair treatment between genders and between U.S. ethnic minorities and non-minorities and to ensure Dow’s pay practices are being implemented as intended. As part of Dow’s ID&E efforts, the Company will continue to conduct annual pay gap studies and actively engage with an external partner to further develop and continue to apply best practices.\nTotal Rewards\nTo achieve Dow’s ambition to be the most innovative, customer-centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world, the Company invests in its people, who are at the heart of the Company, through its Total Rewards plans and programs. The Total Rewards plans and programs are structured to attract, retain and motivate Dow’s employees. Dow’s Total Rewards are designed to support all aspects of its employees – their compensation, future, health, life and career. The Company is committed to aligning its strategy and culture with the needs of its employees and optimizing the investment Dow makes in Total Rewards.\nAs a global company with a diverse team, Dow aims to ensure employees have access to resources that allow them to meet their unique needs. That is why Dow has established three guiding principles that define its Total Rewards strategy: 1) ensuring programs are market competitive, while leading peer companies in equitable and inclusive offerings; 2) providing employees with offerings that align with their preferences; and 3) offering programs that promote fulfilling career and life experiences. Dow adapts its programs for geography-specific requirements, as well as cultural standards and expectations.\n18\nEmployee Engagement, Learning and Development\nThroughout an employee’s career, the Company supports development through a blend of learning approaches including in-person and virtual trainings, digital learning platforms, on-the-job training and a series of leadership development programs. Annually, all employees have the opportunity to provide feedback on employee experience and offer insights into how to improve Dow’s working culture through a global employee opinion survey. A key component of the survey is an opportunity for employees to provide feedback on the effectiveness of their direct leader. In 2021, 70 percent of employees responded to the annual survey. The feedback received through this annual survey and additional quarterly checkpoint surveys is used to drive actions to improve the overall Dow experience for employees across the Company, as well as to support continuous improvement in leader effectiveness.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company permanently employed approximately 35,700 people on a full-time basis.\nAdditional information regarding Dow’s human capital measures can be found in the Company's annual Environmental, Social and Governance (\"ESG\") Report, as well as Dow's U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Report (EEO-1), accessible through the Inclusion and Diversity webpage at\nwww.dow.com/diversity\n. Dow’s website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report.\nOTHER ACTIVITIES\nThe Company engages in property and casualty insurance and reinsurance primarily through its Liana Limited subsidiaries.\n19\nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE REGISTRANT\nSet forth below is information related to the Company's executive officers as of February 4, 2022:\n20"

    "text": "The factors described below represent the Company's principal risks.\nCLIMATE CHANGE - RELATED RISKS\nClimate Change: Climate change-related risks and uncertainties, legal or regulatory responses to climate change and failure to meet the Company’s climate change commitments could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and/or reputation.\nThe Company is subject to increasing climate-related risks and uncertainties, many of which are outside of its control. Climate change may result in more frequent severe weather events, potential changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns, which can disrupt the operations of the Company as well as those of its customers, partners and vendors.\nThe transition to lower greenhouse gas emissions technology, the effects of carbon pricing and changes in public sentiment, regulations, taxes, public mandates or requirements and increases in climate-related lawsuits, insurance premiums and implementation of more robust disaster recovery and business continuity plans could increase costs to maintain or resume the Company’s operations or achieve its sustainability commitments in the expected timeframes, which would negatively impact the Company’s results of operations.\nIn 2020, the Company announced commitments to reduce its net annual greenhouse gas emissions by an additional 5 million metric tons, or 15 percent compared with its 2020 baseline, by 2030 (the 2020 baseline represents a 15 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions since 2005) and its intention to be carbon neutral by 2050 (Scopes 1+2+3, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, plus product benefits). Execution and achievement of these commitments within the currently projected costs and expected timeframes are also subject to risks and uncertainties which include, but are not limited to: advancement, availability, development and affordability of technology necessary to achieve these commitments; unforeseen design, operational and technological difficulties; availability of necessary materials and components; adapting products to customer preferences and customer acceptance of sustainable supply chain solutions; changes in public sentiment and political leadership; the Company’s ability to comply with changing regulations, taxes, mandates or requirements related to greenhouse gas emissions or other climate-related matters; and the pace of regional and global recovery from the pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\"). Given the focus on sustainable investing, if the Company fails to meet its climate change commitments within the committed timeframe and adopt policies and practices to enhance sustainability, the Company’s reputation and its customer and other stakeholder relationships could be negatively impacted and it may be more difficult for the Company to compete effectively or gain access to financing on acceptable terms when needed, which would have an adverse effect on the Company’s results of operations.\nCOVID-19 PANDEMIC - RELATED RISKS\nPublic Health Crisis: A public health crisis or global outbreak of disease, including the pandemic caused by COVID-19 has had, and could continue to have, a negative effect on the Company's manufacturing operations, supply chain and workforce, creating business disruptions that could\ncontinue to have a substantial negative impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe pandemic caused by COVID-19 has impacted all geographic regions where Dow products are produced and sold. The global, regional and local spread of COVID-19, including existing and new variants, has resulted in significant global mitigation measures, including government-directed quarantines, social distancing and shelter-in-place mandates, travel restrictions and/or bans, mask and vaccination mandates, restrictions on large gatherings and restricted access to certain corporate facilities and manufacturing sites. Uncertainty with respect to the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, coupled with oil price fluctuations due in part to the global spread of COVID-19 and the continued increase in global cases, has contributed to the volatility of financial markets. While the severity and duration of the COVID-19 pandemic in key geographic regions and end-markets cannot be reasonably estimated at this time, impacts to the Company include, but are not limited to: fluctuations in the Company’s stock price due to market volatility; a decrease in demand for certain Company products; price declines; reduced profitability; supply chain disruptions impeding the Company’s ability to ship and/or receive product; temporary idling or permanent closure of select manufacturing facilities and/or manufacturing assets; asset impairment charges; interruptions or limitations to manufacturing operations imposed by local, state or federal governments; reduced market liquidity and increased borrowing costs; workforce absenteeism and distraction; labor shortages; customer credit concerns; increased cyber security risk and data accessibility disruptions due to remote working arrangements; workforce reductions and fluctuations in foreign currency markets. Additional risks may include, but are not limited to: shortages of key raw materials; potential impairment in the carrying value of goodwill; additional asset impairment charges; increased obligations related to the Company’s pension and other\n21\npostretirement benefit plans; and tax valuation allowances. Business disruptions and market volatility resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic have had and could have a substantial negative impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. The adverse impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this \"Risk Factors\" section.\nMACROECONOMIC RISKS\nFinancial Commitments and Credit Markets: Market conditions could reduce the Company's flexibility to respond to changing business conditions or fund capital needs.\nAdverse economic conditions could reduce the Company’s flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions or to fund capital expenditures or working capital needs. The economic environment could result in a contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace and reduce sources of liquidity for the Company. This could result in higher borrowing costs.\nGlobal Economic Considerations: The Company operates in a global, competitive environment which gives rise to operating and market risk exposure.\nThe Company sells its broad range of products and services in a competitive, global environment, and competes worldwide for sales on the basis of product quality, price, technology and customer service. Increased levels of competition could result in lower prices or lower sales volume, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. Sales of the Company's products are also subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations; trade agreements; import and export controls; taxes; and duties and tariffs. The imposition of additional regulations, controls, taxes and duties and tariffs or changes to bilateral and regional trade agreements could result in lower sales volume, which could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations.\nEconomic conditions around the world, and in certain industries in which the Company does business, also impact sales price and volume. As a result, market uncertainty or an economic downturn driven by political tensions, war, terrorism, epidemics, pandemics or political instability in the geographic regions or industries in which the Company sells its products could reduce demand for these products and result in decreased sales volume, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.\nIn addition, volatility and disruption of financial markets could limit customers’ ability to obtain adequate financing to maintain operations, which could result in a decrease in sales volume and have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations. The Company’s global business operations also give rise to market risk exposure related to changes in inflation, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks, the Company enters into hedging transactions, where deemed appropriate, pursuant to established guidelines and policies. If the Company fails to effectively manage such risks, it could have a negative impact on its results of operations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits: Increased obligations and expenses related to the Company's defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans could negatively impact its financial condition and results of operations.\nThe Company has defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans (the “plans”) in the United States and a number of other countries. The assets of the Company's funded plans are primarily invested in fixed income securities, equity securities of U.S. and foreign issuers and alternative investments, including investments in real estate, private equity and absolute return strategies. Changes in the market value of plan assets, investment returns, discount rates, mortality rates, regulations and the rate of increase in compensation levels may affect the funded status of the Company's plans and could cause volatility in the net periodic benefit cost, future funding requirements of the plans and the funded status of the plans. A significant increase in the Company's obligations or future funding requirements could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the Company's financial condition.\nSupply/Demand Balance: Earnings generated by the Company's products vary based in part on the balance of supply relative to demand within the industry.\nThe balance of supply relative to demand within the industry may be significantly impacted by the addition of new capacity, especially for basic commodities where capacity is generally added in large increments as world-scale facilities are built. This may disrupt industry balances and result in downward pressure on prices due to the increase in supply, which could negatively impact the Company’s results of operations.\n22\nLEGAL AND REGULATORY RISKS\nEnvironmental Compliance: The costs of complying with evolving regulatory requirements could negatively impact the Company's financial results. Actual or alleged violations of environmental laws or permit requirements could result in restrictions or prohibitions on plant operations, substantial civil or criminal sanctions, as well as the assessment of strict liability and/or joint and several liability.\nThe Company is subject to extensive federal, state, local and foreign laws, regulations, rules and ordinances relating to pollution, protection of the environment, climate change, greenhouse gas emissions, and the generation, storage, handling, transportation, treatment, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and waste materials. In addition, the Company may have costs related to environmental remediation and restoration obligations associated with past and current sites as well as related to its past or current waste disposal practices or other hazardous materials handling. Although management will estimate and accrue liabilities for these obligations, it is reasonably possible that the Company’s ultimate cost with respect to these matters could be significantly higher, which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition and results of operations. Costs and capital expenditures relating to environmental, health or safety matters are subject to evolving regulatory requirements and depend on the timing of the promulgation and enforcement of specific standards which impose the requirements. Moreover, changes in environmental regulations could inhibit or interrupt the Company’s operations, or require modifications to its facilities. Accordingly, environmental, health or safety regulatory matters could result in significant unanticipated costs or liabilities. For additional information, see Part II, Item 7. Other Matters, Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations.\nHealth and Safety: Increased concerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on the environment has resulted in more restrictive regulations and could lead to new regulations.\nConcerns regarding the safe use of chemicals and plastics in commerce and their potential impact on health and the environment reflect a growing trend in societal demands for increasing levels of product safety and environmental protection. These concerns could manifest themselves in stockholder proposals, preferred purchasing, delays or failures in obtaining or retaining regulatory approvals, delayed product launches, lack of market acceptance and continued pressure for more stringent regulatory intervention and litigation. These concerns could also influence public perceptions, the viability or continued sales of certain of the Company's products, its reputation and the cost to comply with regulations. In addition, terrorist attacks and natural disasters have increased concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. These concerns could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.\nLocal, state, federal and foreign governments continue to propose new regulations related to the security of chemical plant locations and the transportation of hazardous chemicals, which could result in higher operating costs.\nLitigation: The Company is party to a number of claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability, patent infringement, employment matters, governmental tax and regulation disputes, contract and commercial litigation, and other actions.\nCertain of the claims and lawsuits facing the Company purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts. All such claims are contested. With the exception of the possible effect of the asbestos-related liability of Union Carbide Corporation (“Union Carbide”) and Chapter 11 related matters of Dow Silicones Corporation (\"Dow Silicones\") as described below, it is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. At December 31, 2021, Union Carbide's total asbestos-related liability, including future defense and processing costs, was $1,016 million ($1,098 million at December 31, 2020).\nIn 1995, Dow Silicones, a former 50:50 joint venture, voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to resolve breast implant liabilities and related matters (the “Chapter 11 Proceeding”). Dow Silicones emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on June 1, 2004, and is implementing the Joint Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”). The Plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding. Dow Silicones’ liability for breast implant and other product liability claims was $130 million at December 31, 2021 ($160 million at December 31, 2020). See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on litigation matters.\n23\nPlastic Waste: Increased concerns regarding plastic waste in the environment, consumers selectively reducing their consumption of plastic products, a lack of plastic waste collection and recycling infrastructure, or new or more restrictive regulations and rules related to plastic waste could reduce demand for the Company’s plastic products and could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.\nLocal, state, federal and foreign governments have been increasingly proposing regulations to address the global plastic waste challenge, including, but not limited to, extended producer responsibility fees, a Global Plastics Treaty and bans on non-essential items. These regulations on plastic waste drive demand toward plastic solutions that are recyclable, reusable, made with recycled content and/or renewable raw materials. In addition, without proper waste collection and recycling infrastructure at scale, plastics have faced increased public scrutiny due to negative coverage of plastic waste in the environment, including the world’s oceans and rivers. As Dow is one of the world’s largest producers of plastics, increased pressure on the use of plastics, despite positive carbon benefits and essential functions such as food preservation and medical uses, could cause reduced demand for the Company’s polyethylene products which could negatively impact the Company’s financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nOPERATIONAL AND STRATEGIC RISKS\nCompany Strategy: Implementing certain elements of the Company's strategy could negatively impact its financial results.\nThe Company currently has manufacturing operations, sales and marketing activities, and joint ventures in emerging geographic regions. Activities in these geographic regions are accompanied by uncertainty and risks including: navigating different government regulatory environments; relationships with new, local partners; project funding commitments and guarantees; expropriation, military actions, war, terrorism and political instability; sabotage; uninsurable risks; suppliers not performing as expected resulting in increased risk of extended project timelines; and determining raw material supply and other details regarding product movement. In addition, disruptions to supply chains, distribution chains and/or public and private infrastructure, including those caused by industry capacity constraints, material availability, global logistics delays and constraints arising from, among other things, the transportation capacity of ocean shipping containers and labor availability constraints, could materially and adversely impact our business operations.  If the manufacturing operations, supply chains, sales and marketing activities, and/or implementation of these projects is not successful, it could adversely affect the Company’s financial condition, cash flows and results of operations.\nCyber Threat: The risk of loss of the Company’s trade secrets, know-how or other sensitive business information or disruption of operations could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.\nCyber-attacks or security breaches could compromise confidential, business critical information, cause a disruption in the Company’s operations or harm the Company's reputation. The Company has attractive information assets, including trade secrets, know-how and other sensitive, business critical information. While the Company has a comprehensive cyber-security program that is continuously reviewed, maintained and upgraded, a significant cyber-attack could result in the loss of critical business information and/or could negatively impact operations, which could have a negative impact on the Company’s financial results.\nGoodwill: An impairment of goodwill could negatively impact the Company’s financial results.\nAt least annually, the Company assesses goodwill for impairment. If testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, the carrying value is written down based on fair value with a charge against earnings. Where the Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology in determining fair value, continued weak demand for a specific product line or business could result in an impairment. Accordingly, any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of goodwill could negatively impact the Company's results of operations. See Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding the Company's goodwill impairment testing.\nOperational Event: A significant operational event could negatively impact the Company's results of operations.\nAs a diversified chemical manufacturing company, the Company's operations, the transportation of products, cyber-attacks, pandemics and other public health-related events or severe weather conditions and other natural phenomena (such as freezing, drought, hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, floods, etc.) could result in an unplanned event that could be significant in scale and could negatively impact operations, neighbors or the public at large, which could have a negative impact on the Company's results of operations.\n24\nMajor hurricanes and other weather-related events have caused significant disruption in the Company's operations on the U.S. Gulf Coast, logistics across the region, and the supply of certain raw materials, which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of its products. Due to the Company's substantial presence on the U.S. Gulf Coast, similar severe weather conditions or other natural phenomena in the future could negatively impact the Company's results of operations.\nRaw Materials: Availability of purchased feedstock and energy, and the volatility of these costs, impact Dow’s operating costs and add variability to earnings.\nPurchased feedstock and energy costs account for a substantial portion of the Company’s total production costs and operating expenses. The Company purchases hydrocarbon raw materials including ethane, propane, butane, naphtha and condensate as feedstocks and also purchases certain monomers, primarily ethylene and propylene, to supplement internal production, as well as other raw materials. The Company also purchases natural gas, primarily to generate electricity, and purchases electric power to supplement internal generation.\nFeedstock and energy costs generally follow price trends in crude oil and natural gas, which are sometimes volatile. While the Company uses its feedstock flexibility and financial and physical hedging programs to help mitigate feedstock cost increases, the Company is not always able to immediately raise selling prices. Ultimately, the ability to pass on underlying cost increases is dependent on market conditions. Conversely, when feedstock and energy costs decline, selling prices generally decline as well. As a result, volatility in these costs could impact the Company’s results of operations.\nThe Company has a number of investments on the U.S. Gulf Coast to take advantage of increasing supplies of low-cost natural gas and natural gas liquids (\"NGLs\") derived from shale gas including: the St. Charles Operations (\"SCO-2\") ethylene production facility, which commenced operations in December 2012; an on-purpose propylene production facility, which commenced operations in December 2015; an ethylene production facility in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which included expanding the facility’s ethylene production capacity and modifications to enable full ethane cracking flexibility; completion of a new integrated world-scale ethylene production facility and a new ELITE™ Enhanced Polyethylene production facility, both located in Freeport, Texas, in 2017, and a capacity expansion project which brought the facility’s total ethylene capacity to 2,000 kilotonnes per annum in 2020; and, the Company commenced operations in 2018 on its new LDPE production facility and its new NORDEL™ Metallocene EPDM production facility, both located in Plaquemine, Louisiana. As a result of these investments, the Company’s exposure to purchased ethylene and propylene is expected to decline, offset by increased exposure to ethane- and propane-based feedstocks.\nWhile the Company expects abundant and cost-advantaged supplies of NGLs in the United States to persist for the foreseeable future, if NGLs become significantly less advantaged than crude oil-based feedstocks, it could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations and future investments. Also, if the Company’s key suppliers of feedstock and energy are unable to provide the raw materials required for production, it could have a negative impact on the Company’s results of operations.\nSeparation from DowDuPont: Risks related to achieving the anticipated benefits of Dow's separation from DowDuPont.\nRisks related to achieving the anticipated benefits of Dow's separation from DowDuPont include, but are not limited to, a number of conditions outside the control of Dow, including risks related to: (i) Dow's failure to achieve in full the anticipated benefits from the separation from DowDuPont; (ii) certain tax risks associated with the separation; (iii) the failure of Dow's pro forma financial information to be a reliable indicator of Dow's future results; (iv) receipt of less favorable terms in the commercial agreements Dow entered into with DuPont and Corteva, Inc. (\"Corteva\"), including restrictions under intellectual property cross-license agreements, than Dow would have received from an unaffiliated third party; and (v) Dow's obligation to indemnify DuPont and/or Corteva for certain liabilities."

    "text": "Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nUnion Carbide Corporation (“Union Carbide”), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc.\nFor additional information, see Part II, Item 7. Other Matters, Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nEnvironmental Proceedings\nOn August 27, 2019, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\"), U.S. Department of Justice, Texas Environmental Quality Board, and Texas Office of the Attorney General (collectively, the “Government Agencies”) added Performance Materials NA, Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, as an additional signatory to an existing draft consent decree relating to alleged environmental violations at the Sabine olefins manufacturing facility in Orange, Texas (the \"Orange, TX Facility\"). Performance Materials NA, Inc. acquired the Orange, TX Facility in February 2019 and became a subsidiary of the Company in April 2019. The alleged violations were first identified during multimedia environmental inspections that the EPA conducted at the Orange, TX Facility while under prior ownership in March 2009 and December 2015, and involve the management of materials in the Orange, TX Facility’s wastewater treatment system, hazardous waste management, and air emissions, including leak detection and repair. The Government Agencies filed a proposed final consent decree in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas on October 13, 2021. On January 27, 2022, the Government Agencies filed a motion asking the court to approve, sign and enter a modified consent decree that reflects the recent merger of Performance Materials NA, Inc. with and into the Company. On January 28, 2022, the modified consent decree was approved by the court and became effective.\nOn May 17, 2021, the Company received a civil complaint from the State of Texas (\"State\") on behalf of the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The complaint, filed in the 250th District Court of Travis County, Texas, alleges environmental violations at the Company's Freeport, Texas, site involving 12 discrete air emissions events. The State is seeking monetary relief of no more than $1 million and injunctive relief to prevent recurrence. On August 31, 2021, the State informed the Company that it would be including additional air emissions events in the complaint, which may impact the monetary relief sought by the State."

The information reflected in the report is equally applicable to both Dow Inc. and TDCC, except where otherwise noted.\nThe separation was contemplated by the merger of equals transaction effective August 31, 2017, under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017. TDCC and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Historical DuPont”) each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont and, as a result, TDCC and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the “Merger”). Subsequent to the Merger, TDCC and Historical DuPont engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. Dow Inc. was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont to serve as the holding company for the materials science business.\nAs of the effective date and time of the distribution, DowDuPont did not beneficially own any equity interest in Dow and no longer consolidated Dow and its consolidated subsidiaries into its financial results. The consolidated financial results of Dow for the applicable periods presented reflect the distribution of TDCC’s agricultural sciences business (“AgCo”) and specialty products business (“SpecCo”) as discontinued operations, as well as reflect the receipt of Historical DuPont’s ethylene and ethylene copolymers businesses (other than its ethylene acrylic elastomers business) (“ECP”) as a common control transaction from the closing of the Merger on August 31, 2017 (\"Merger Date\"). See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements and Dow Inc.'s Amendment No. 4 to the Registration Statement on Form 10 filed with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") on March 8, 2019 for additional information.\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity are presented on a continuing operations basis.\nExcept as otherwise indicated by the context, the term \"Union Carbide\" means Union Carbide Corporation and the term \"Dow Silicones\" means Dow Silicones Corporation, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nItems Affecting Comparability of Financial Results\nAs a result of the separation from DowDuPont, pro forma net sales and pro forma Operating EBIT for the year ended December 31, 2019 are provided in this section and based on the consolidated financial statements of TDCC, adjusted to give effect to the separation from DowDuPont as if it had been consummated on January 1, 2017. Pro forma adjustments include (1) the margin impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva, Inc. (\"Corteva\") in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont, and (2) the elimination of the impact of events directly attributable to the Merger, internal reorganization and business realignment, separation, distribution and other related transactions (e.g., one-time transaction costs). These adjustments impacted the consolidated results as well as the reportable segments. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of the pro forma adjustments impacting segment measures for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n29\nSTATEMENT ON COVID-19 AND U.S. GULF COAST FREEZE\nCOVID-19\nThe pandemic caused by coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") has impacted all geographic regions where Dow products are produced and sold. Throughout this public health crisis, the Company has been focused on the health and safety of its employees, contractors, customers and suppliers around the world and maintaining the safe and reliable operations of its manufacturing sites. Although supply disruptions and related logistics issues have posed challenges across all modes of transportation, the Company’s manufacturing sites have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic, with no significant impact to manufacturing whether through shutdowns or shortages in labor, raw materials or personal protective equipment. Contingency plans remain in place in the event of significant impacts from COVID-19 infection resurgences.\nIn January 2022, the Company opened all sites and locations to employees, where permitted by local regulations, and continues to require that several health and safety measures be followed. All regions continue to follow on-site workforce restrictions in accordance with government regulations. At the time of this filing, approximately half of Dow’s global workforce is working remotely. The Company continues to encourage its workforce to practice safe behaviors in the workplace and while away from work to help prevent community spread of COVID-19.\nThe Company is well-positioned for continued profitable growth in the ongoing economic recovery and improving industry cycle. The Company will maintain its disciplined focus on capital allocation priorities as it benefits from an improving cost structure, financial flexibility and a low-cost operating model. Through the ongoing market recovery, Dow has experienced increasing margins as differentiated parts of the portfolio see improved demand and underlying market dynamics, which has enabled a return to pre-COVID-19 sales levels and end-market growth across most businesses.\nThe Company has continued to maintain a strong financial position and liquidity throughout the economic recession triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic and its ongoing recovery. At December 31, 2021, the Company had cash and committed and available forms of liquidity of $12.6 billion. The Company also has no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2026.\nAdditional information regarding the risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic can be found in this report in Part 1, Item 1A, Risk Factors.\nU.S. Gulf Coast Freeze\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Winter Storm Uri had a broad impact on the U.S. Gulf Coast and in particular across the entire state of Texas, which resulted in widespread utility and raw material supply disruptions and industry-wide production outages. All Dow ethylene production facilities located on the U.S. Gulf Coast were operational by March 31, 2021, along with all sites. As a result of the winter storm, the product and supply chain impacts across the industry created very tight supply dynamics and generated pricing momentum for both raw materials and finished goods. The Company remains close to its customers and continues to work diligently to meet demand needs.\n30\nABOUT DOW\nDow combines global breadth; asset integration and scale; focused innovation and materials science expertise; leading business positions; and environmental, social and governance (ESG) leadership to achieve profitable growth and deliver a sustainable future.

COS as a percentage of sales was 80.4 percent in 2021 compared with 86.5 percent in 2020.\n36\nCOS was $33.3 billion in 2020, compared with $36.7 billion in 2019. COS decreased in 2020 primarily due to lower feedstock and other raw material costs, decreased sales volume and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs, which were partially offset by higher performance-based compensation costs. Operating rates declined significantly in the second quarter of 2020, as the Company temporarily idled certain manufacturing facilities and selectively adjusted operating rates at other facilities to balance production to demand in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

SG&A expenses in 2021 increased primarily due to increased performance-based compensation costs and fringe benefit expenses driven by stock market increases compared with the same period last year. SG&A expenses in 2020 decreased compared to 2019 primarily due to cost reductions which were partially offset by increased performance-based compensation costs. In 2020, SG&A was also favorably impacted by the recovery of legal costs related to the Nova Chemicals Corporation (\"Nova\") ethylene asset matter and the reversal of a bad debt reserve related to an arbitration judgment. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Nova litigation matters.\nAmortization of Intangibles\nAmortization of intangibles was $388 million in 2021, compared with $401 million in 2020 and $419 million in 2019.

As a result, the Company recorded a $1,755 million pretax charge related to Sadara. The charge by segment was as follows: $370 million in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $1,168 million in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and $217 million in Corporate.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized additional pretax impairment charges of $58 million related primarily to capital additions at its Santa Vitoria manufacturing facility, which was impaired in 2017. Impairment charges by segment were as follows: $44 million in Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $9 million in Performance Materials & Coatings and $5 million in Corporate.\nSee Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges.\nIntegration and Separation Costs\nIntegration and separation costs, which reflect costs related to post-Merger integration and business separation activities, were $239 million in 2020 and $1,063 million and $1,039 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, in 2019. Integration and business separation activities were completed as of December 31, 2020. Integration and separation costs are related to Corporate.\n38\nEquity in Earnings (Losses) of Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company’s share of equity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates was $975 million in 2021, compared with equity losses of $18 million in 2020 and $94 million in 2019. The equity earnings improvement in 2021 compared with 2020 was primarily due to margin expansion at Sadara driven by broad-based price increases, strong MEG prices at the Kuwait joint ventures and improved elastomer and polyethylene margins at the Thai joint ventures. In 2020, equity losses decreased compared with 2019 primarily due to lower equity losses from Sadara, driven by improved industry supply and demand dynamics in the third and fourth quarters of 2020, which were partially offset by lower equity earnings from the Kuwait joint ventures due to lower monoethylene glycol prices. See Note 12 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company’s evaluation of its equity method investment in Sadara for other-than-temporary impairment in 2019.\nSundry Income (Expense) - Net\nSundry income (expense) – net includes a variety of income and expense items such as foreign currency exchange gains and losses, dividends from investments, gains and losses on sales of investments and assets, non-operating pension and other postretirement benefit plan credits or costs, losses on early extinguishment of debt and certain litigation matters.\nTDCC\nSundry income (expense) - net for 2021 was expense of $79 million, compared with income of $1,274 million in 2020 and $573 million in 2019.\nIn 2021, sundry income (expense) - net included a $574 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (related to Corporate and included in \"Other net loss\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows), and foreign currency exchange losses. These were partially offset by non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits, gains on the sale of assets and investments, a $54 million gain related to an arbitration award (related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure), and a $16 million gain related to post-closing adjustments on the previous divestiture of a bio-ethanol manufacturing facility in Brazil (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics). See Notes 7, 15, 16, 20 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn 2020, sundry income (expense) - net included a $544 million gain related to the Nova ethylene asset matter (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), a $499 million gain related to the sale of certain U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets ($17 million related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $61 million related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and $421 million related to Corporate), a $233 million gain related to the sale of rail infrastructure operations and assets in the U.S. & Canada ($48 million related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics and $185 million related to Corporate), and non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits. These were partially offset by a $149 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (related to Corporate and included in \"Other net loss\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows), foreign currency exchange losses, $11 million in charges associated with agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution, which provides for cross-indemnities and allocations of obligations and liabilities for periods prior to, at and after completion of the separation (related to Corporate), a $13 million loss related to the divestiture of a bio-ethanol manufacturing facility in Brazil (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics) and a $2 million loss on an asset sale (related to Corporate). See Notes 5, 7, 15, 16, 20 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nIn 2019, sundry income (expense) - net included foreign currency exchange gains, non-operating pension and postretirement benefit plan credits and gains on sales of assets and investments, as well as a net gain of $205 million related to litigation matters, which included a $170 million gain related to a legal matter with Nova (related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics), and an $85 million gain related to an adjustment of the Dow Silicones breast implant liability (related to Corporate), which were partially offset by a $50 million charge (net of indemnifications of $37 million), related to the settlement of the Dow Silicones commercial creditor matters (related to Corporate). In 2019, sundry income (expense) - net also included a $102 million loss on the early extinguishment of debt (related to Corporate and included in \"Other net loss\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows) and a gain of $2 million on post-closing adjustments related to previous divestitures (related to Corporate). See Notes 7, 15, 16, 20 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nDow Inc.\nSundry income (expense) - net for 2021 was expense of $35 million, compared with income of $1,269 million in 2020 and $461 million in 2019.\n39\nIn 2021, in addition to the amounts previously discussed above for TDCC, sundry income (expense) - net included $30 million in gains associated with the agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution (related to Corporate).\nIn 2020, in addition to the amounts previously discussed above for TDCC, sundry income (expense) - net included $10 million in charges associated with the agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution (related to Corporate).\nIn 2019, in addition to the amounts previously discussed above for TDCC, sundry income (expense) - net included a $51 million loss on post-closing adjustments related to a previous divestiture and $69 million in charges associated with the agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution (both related to Corporate). See Notes 3, 7, 15, 16, 20 and 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nInterest Expense and Amortization of Debt Discount\nInterest expense and amortization of debt discount was $731 million in 2021, compared with $827 million in 2020 and $933 million and $952 million for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, in 2019. Interest expense and amortization of debt discount decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower coupon rates and the redemption of debt. The decrease in 2020 is primarily due to TDCC's redemption of long-term debt in 2019 and debt issuances at lower coupon rates in 2020. See Liquidity and Capital Resources in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to debt financing activity. In addition, TDCC had interest expense related to an intercompany loan with Dow Inc. in 2019.\nProvision for Income Taxes on Continuing Operations\nThe Company's effective tax rate fluctuates based on, among other factors, where income is earned, the level of income relative to tax attributes and the level of equity earnings, since most earnings from the Company's equity method investments are taxed at the joint venture level. The underlying factors affecting the Company's overall tax rate are summarized in Note 8 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nThe CARES Act was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. There were no significant impacts to the Company's provision for income taxes on continuing operations in 2021 or 2020 as a result of the CARES Act legislation.\nThe provision for income taxes on continuing operations was $1,740 million in 2021, compared with $777 million in 2020 and $470 million in 2019. The provision for income taxes in 2021 increased primarily due to an increase in pretax income and the recognition of uncertain tax positions in multiple jurisdictions. These factors resulted in an effective tax rate of 21.4 percent for Dow Inc. in 2021.\nThe tax rate for 2020 was unfavorably impacted by valuation allowances of $260 million related to foreign tax credits and other attributes that are more likely than not to remain unutilized prior to their expiration. The tax rate for 2020 was favorably impacted by a capital loss resulting from the divestiture of the Santa Vitoria manufacturing facility. This resulted in an effective tax rate of 37.5 percent for Dow Inc. in 2020.\nThe tax rate for 2019 was unfavorably impacted by non-deductible goodwill and investment impairments, geographic mix of earnings and reduced equity earnings. These factors resulted in a negative effective tax rate of 37.7 percent for Dow Inc. in 2019.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company recorded the impacts of tax law changes enacted in Switzerland. As a result, deferred tax assets increased by $92 million.\nIncome from Discontinued Operations, Net of Tax\nIncome from discontinued operations, net of tax was $445 million in 2019, related to the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo to DowDuPont as a result of the separation. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n40\nNet Income Attributable to Noncontrolling Interests\nNet income attributable to noncontrolling interests was $94 million in 2021, $69 million in 2020 and $87 million in 2019. Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests from discontinued operations of $13 million in 2019 related to the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo to DowDuPont as a result of the separation are included in the amounts above. See Notes 19 and 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nNet Income (Loss) Available for the Common Stockholder(s)\nDow Inc.\nNet income available for Dow Inc. common stockholders was $6,311 million in 2021, compared with $1,225 million in 2020 and a net loss of $1,359 million in 2019. Earnings per share of Dow Inc. was $8.38 per share in 2021, compared with $1.64 per share in 2020 and a loss of $1.84 per share in 2019. See Note 9 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for details on Dow Inc.'s earnings per share calculations.\nTDCC\nNet income available for TDCC common stockholder was $6,274 million in 2021, compared with $1,235 million in 2020 and a net loss of $1,237 million in 2019. Following the separation from DowDuPont, TDCC's common shares are owned solely by Dow Inc.\nSEGMENT RESULTS\nThe Company conducts its worldwide operations through six global businesses which are organized into the following operating segments: Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the operating segments and the Company's totals. The Company did not aggregate any operating segments when determining its reportable segments. The Company reports geographic information for the following regions: U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific, Latin America and EMEAI. The Company transfers ethylene to its downstream derivative businesses at market prices. The Company also allocated costs previously assigned to AgCo and SpecCo (\"stranded costs\") to the operating segments.\nThe Company’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBIT (for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020) and pro forma Operating EBIT (for the year ended December 31, 2019) as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. The Company defines pro forma Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, plus pro forma adjustments, excluding the impact of significant items. Operating EBIT by segment and pro forma Operating EBIT by segment include all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to Dow as a whole are assigned to Corporate. The Company also presents pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019, as it is included in management’s measure of segment performance and is regularly reviewed by the CODM. Pro forma net sales includes the impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for reconciliations of these measures and a summary of the pro forma adjustments impacting segment measures, which are consistent with the pro forma adjustments included in the Current Report on Form 8-K filed on June 3, 2019, with the SEC.\nPACKAGING & SPECIALTY PLASTICS\nThe Packaging & Specialty Plastics operating segment consists of two highly integrated global businesses: Hydrocarbons & Energy and Packaging and Specialty Plastics. The segment employs the industry’s broadest polyolefin product portfolio, supported by the Company’s proprietary catalyst and manufacturing process technologies. These differentiators, plus collaboration at the customer’s design table, enable the segment to deliver more reliable, durable, higher-performing solutions designed for recyclability and enhanced plastics circularity and sustainability. The segment serves customers, brand owners and ultimately consumers in key markets including food and specialty packaging; industrial and consumer packaging; health and hygiene; caps, closures and pipe applications; consumer durables; mobility and transportation; and infrastructure. Ethylene is transferred to downstream derivative businesses at market-based prices, which are generally equivalent to prevailing market prices for large volume purchases. This segment also includes the results of The Kuwait Styrene Company K.S.C.C. and The SCG-Dow Group, as well as a portion of the results of EQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C.C.\n41\n(\"EQUATE\"), The Kuwait Olefins Company K.S.C.C. (\"TKOC\"), Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited (\"Map Ta Phut\") and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company.\nThe Company is responsible for marketing a majority of Sadara products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company's established sales channels. As part of this arrangement, the Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee. In March 2021, Dow and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company agreed to transition the marketing rights and responsibilities for Sadara’s finished products to levels more consistent with each partner’s equity ownership. This transition began in July 2021 and is being implemented over the next five years.\n2021 Versus 2020\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics net sales were $28,128 million in 2021, up 54 percent from net sales of $18,301 million in 2020, with local price up 50 percent, volume up 2 percent and a favorable currency impact of 2 percent, primarily in EMEAI. Local price increased in both businesses and across all geographic regions, driven by tight supply and demand dynamics. Local price increased in Hydrocarbons & Energy as prices for co-products are generally correlated to Brent crude oil prices, which, on average, increased 64 percent compared with 2020. Local price increased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics driven by favorable supply and demand dynamics in polyethylene, notably in industrial and consumer packaging and flexible food and beverage packaging applications. Volume increased in Hydrocarbons & Energy, primarily in the U.S. & Canada and EMEAI, more than offsetting decreased volume in Asia Pacific. Volume decreased in Packaging and Specialty Plastics, primarily in Asia Pacific and Latin America as supply constraints continue to lower exports, more than offsetting an increase in the U.S. & Canada.\nOperating EBIT was $6,638 million in 2021, up $4,313 million from Operating EBIT of $2,325 million in 2020. Operating EBIT increased primarily due to integrated margin expansion and increased equity earnings at Sadara and the Thai and Kuwait joint ventures.\n42\n2020 Versus 2019\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics net sales were $18,301 million in 2020, down 10 percent from net sales and pro forma net sales of $20,245 million in 2019, with local price down 11 percent and volume up 1 percent. Net sales declined in the first half of the year, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, while strong supply and demand dynamics took hold in the second half of the year. Local price decreased in both businesses and across all geographic regions, driven by reduced polyethylene prices and lower global energy prices. Local price declined in Hydrocarbons & Energy as prices for co-products are generally correlated to Brent crude oil prices, which declined 33 percent compared with 2019. Volume increased in Hydrocarbons & Energy as increases in EMEAI were partially offset by declines in the U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America. Packaging and Specialty Plastics volume was flat as increases in flexible food and specialty packaging, industrial and consumer packaging and health and hygiene applications in Asia Pacific, Latin America and EMEAI were offset by reduced demand for functional polymers, primarily due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and lower catalyst licensing activity in the U.S. & Canada.\nOperating EBIT was $2,325 million in 2020, down 20 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $2,904 million in 2019. Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to integrated margin compression in both businesses. These declines more than offset cost reductions, decreased planned maintenance turnaround costs and increased equity earnings.\nINDUSTRIAL INTERMEDIATES & INFRASTRUCTURE\nThe Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating segment consists of two customer-centric global businesses - Industrial Solutions and Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals - that develop important intermediate chemicals that are essential to manufacturing processes, as well as downstream, customized materials and formulations that use advanced development technologies. These businesses primarily produce and market ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives that are aligned to market segments as diverse as appliances, coatings, electronics, surfactants for cleaning and sanitization, infrastructure and oil and gas. The businesses' global scale and reach, world-class technology, R&D capabilities and materials science expertise enable the Company to be a premier solutions provider offering customers value-add sustainable solutions to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, product effectiveness and durability across a wide range of home comfort and appliance, building and construction, mobility and transportation, adhesive and lubricant applications, among others. This segment also includes a portion of the results of EQUATE, TKOC, Map Ta Phut and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company.\nThe Company is responsible for marketing a majority of Sadara products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company's established sales channels. As part of this arrangement, the Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee. In March 2021, Dow and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company agreed to transition the marketing rights and responsibilities for Sadara’s finished products to levels more consistent with each partner’s equity ownership. This transition began in July 2021 and is being implemented over the next five years.\n43\n2021 Versus 2020\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure net sales were $16,851 million in 2021, up 40 percent from $12,021 million in 2020, with local price up 40 percent, a favorable currency impact of 2 percent and volume down 2 percent. Local price increased in both businesses and across all geographic regions, primarily driven by strong supply and demand dynamics and rising energy prices. Currency favorably impacted sales in both businesses. Volume in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals decreased in the U.S. & Canada and Asia Pacific, partially offset by increased volume in EMEAI and Latin America. The volume decrease in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals was due to a decrease in vinyl chloride monomers mainly related to a planned transition of a low-margin co-producer contract as well as a decrease in isocyanates, which were partially offset by robust consumer demand in polyurethane systems. Despite strong consumer demand, volume in Industrial Solutions decreased in all geographic regions, except Latin America and was largely driven by weather-related supply constraints.\nOperating EBIT was $2,282 million in 2021, up $1,927 million from Operating EBIT of $355 million in 2020. Operating EBIT increased primarily due to margin expansion from strong supply and demand dynamics in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals and higher equity earnings at Sadara and the Kuwait joint ventures.\n2020 Versus 2019\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure net sales were $12,021 million in 2020, down 11 percent from $13,440 million in 2019. Net sales decreased 11 percent from pro forma net sales of $13,449 million in 2019, with volume down 6 percent and local price down 5 percent. Weak demand for products used in consumer durable good end-markets, including construction, furniture and bedding, appliances and automotive, drove volume declines in Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals in all geographic regions, reflecting the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on consumer activities and buying patterns, most notably in the first half of the year. Volume in Industrial Solutions was also impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, with decreases in the U.S. & Canada and Latin America which were partially offset by increases in Asia Pacific and EMEAI. The volume decline in Industrial Solutions was due to weakened demand in industrial, energy and automotive end-markets partially offset by stronger demand for products used in electronics, agriculture and pharma applications. Local price decreased in both businesses and in all geographic regions, primarily due to lower global energy prices and raw material costs.\nOperating EBIT was $355 million in 2020, down 58 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $845 million in 2019. Operating EBIT decreased due to lower demand and margin compression, which were partially offset by cost reductions, decreased equity losses and lower planned maintenance turnaround costs. The overall decrease in equity losses was driven by lower equity losses from Sadara partially offset by decreased equity earnings from EQUATE.\n44\nPERFORMANCE MATERIALS & COATINGS\nThe Performance Materials & Coatings operating segment includes industry-leading franchises that deliver a wide array of solutions into consumer, infrastructure and mobility end-markets. The segment consists of two global businesses: Coatings & Performance Monomers and Consumer Solutions. These businesses primarily utilize the Company's acrylics-, cellulosics- and silicone-based technology platforms to serve the needs of the architectural and industrial coatings; home care and personal care; consumer and electronics; mobility and transportation; industrial and chemical processing; and building and infrastructure end-markets. Both businesses employ materials science capabilities, global reach and unique products and technology to combine chemistry platforms to deliver differentiated, market-driven and sustainable innovations to customers.\n1.\nAs reported net sales for the year ended December 31, 2020 compared with pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019.\n2021 Versus 2020\nPerformance Materials & Coatings net sales were $9,672 million in 2021, up 22 percent from net sales of $7,951 million in 2020, with local price up 19 percent, volume up 1 percent, and a favorable currency impact of 2 percent. Local price increased in both businesses and across all geographic regions. Consumer Solutions local price increased in both upstream siloxanes and downstream silicones due to favorable supply and demand dynamics and higher raw material costs. Local price increased in Coatings & Performance Monomers primarily due to improved supply and demand dynamics and higher raw material costs in acrylic monomers and architectural coatings.\nVolume increased i\nn the U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific and Latin America, which was partially offset by a decrease in EMEAI. Consumer Solutions volume increased due to higher demand in all geographic regions partially offset by planned maintenance turnaround activity. Volume decreased in Coatings & Performance Monomers in all geographic regions primarily due to supply availability challenges caused by weather-related outages and third-party supply and logistics constraints. The favorable currency impact was driven by Asia Pacific and EMEAI.\nOperating EBIT was $866 million in 2021, up $552 million from Operating EBIT of $314 million in 2020. Operating EBIT increased primarily due to margin expansion and higher volume in Consumer Solutions.\n45\n2020 Versus 2019\nPerformance Materials & Coatings net sales were $7,951 million in 2020, down 11 percent from net sales of $8,923 million in 2019. Net sales decreased 11 percent from pro forma net sales of $8,961 million in 2019, with local price down 6 percent and volume down 5 percent. Local price decreased in both businesses and across all geographic regions. Consumer Solutions local price declined in all regions, primarily in upstream siloxanes due to weak supply and demand dynamics. Local price decreased in Coatings & Performance Monomers in response to lower feedstock and other raw material costs. Volume declined in all geographic regions except Latin America, reflecting the impact from the COVID-19 pandemic. Consumer Solutions volume decreased as growth in home care applications was more than offset by lower demand for products used in automotive, industrial, construction and personal care end-markets as consumer activities and buying patterns were limited by the COVID-19 pandemic. Coatings & Performance Monomers volume increased in all geographic regions, except EMEAI. Volume gains were driven by higher demand for methacrylates used in protective applications, for architectural coatings as consumers continued do-it-yourself projects at home, and higher demand for vinyl acetate monomers.\nOperating EBIT was $314 million in 2020, down 66 percent from pro forma Operating EBIT of $918 million in 2019. Operating EBIT decreased primarily due to margin compression, lower demand in siloxanes as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and higher manufacturing and planned maintenance turnaround costs that more than offset volume gains in Coatings & Performance Monomers and lower SG&A costs.\nCORPORATE\nCorporate includes certain enterprise and governance activities (including insurance operations, environmental operations, etc.); non-business aligned joint ventures; non-business aligned litigation expenses; and discontinued or non-aligned businesses.\n2021 Versus 2020\nNet sales for Corporate, which primarily relate to the Company's insurance operations, were $317 million in 2021, up from net sales of $269 million in 2020.\nOperating EBIT was a loss of $253 million in 2021, compared with Operating EBIT loss of $279 million in 2020. Operating EBIT improved primarily due to improved equity earnings.\n2020 Versus 2019\nNet sales for Corporate, which primarily relate to the Company's insurance operations, were $269 million in 2020, down from net sales and pro forma net sales of $343 million in 2019.\nOperating EBIT was a loss of $279 million in 2020, compared with a pro forma Operating EBIT loss of $315 million in 2019. Compared with 2019, Operating EBIT improved primarily due to cost reductions and stranded cost removal throughout 2019.\n46\nOUTLOOK\nOperating Segments & End-Market Expectations\nIn 2022, economic forecasts are projecting above average global gross domestic product (\"GDP\") growth rates due to strong industrial and consumer demand trends which have the potential to positively impact sales volume. Inflationary impacts on natural gas and feedstocks, driven by external macroeconomic and geopolitical factors, remain a potential risk in the near-term, but are expected to be moderate as warmer weather lowers demand for heating supply. The Company anticipates constructive global demand for crude oil compared with 2021 due to ongoing recovery in travel and mobility. Crude oil fundamentals suggest global supply will lag the growing demand that provides support to oil prices and oil-to-gas spreads.\nIn Packaging & Specialty Plastics, supply improvements following significant weather-related disruptions in 2021 are expected to drive sales volume on continued underlying demand strength, notably in flexible food and specialty packaging, industrial and consumer packaging and functional polymers. Integrated margins are expected to stabilize with recent industry supply additions. The Company’s regional feedstock cost advantages will help offset elevated raw material and energy costs. Other important factors that will impact performance are raw material and logistics challenges; industry operating rates; and timing of additional industry capacity startups.\nIn Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure, volume growth is expected across the portfolio, driven by continued underlying demand strength for products used in furniture and bedding, appliances, automotive, construction, electronics and pharma applications. The methylene diphenyl diisocyanate value chain is expected to remain tight with industry capacity additions trailing demand growth. Propylene oxide is expected to be impacted by new capacity entering the market, particularly in Asia Pacific. Ethylene oxide supply is expected to remain tight, with limited industry capacity additions in the near-term and continued demand strength. Margins for the segment are expected to benefit from high-value specialties aligned to strategic incremental growth capacity additions.\nIn Performance Materials & Coatings, sales growth is expected in downstream silicones, particularly for products used in mobility and transportation, high performance building and construction, industrial, consumer, and electronics applications. The Company continues to pursue incremental downstream silicones capacity debottlenecking and growth projects to meet demand growth in consumer-driven end-markets. Within siloxanes, increased supply availability is expected to drive sales volume. Global demand strength in architectural and industrial coatings is expected to drive sales volume. The Company remains well-positioned to benefit from its customers’ shift to sustainable chemistries where Dow has unique technologies and solutions to offer in both business units.\nOther factors impacting operating segment profitability include:\n•\nPlanned maintenance turnaround spending is expected to increase approximately $100 million compared with 2021 due to inflationary pressures on materials and labor.\n•\nEquity in earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates is expected to decrease compared with 2021 as margins compress on industry supply additions, lower Asian olefins and mono ethylene glycol prices, and increasing raw material costs.\nProjected Uses of Cash\nItems that may impact the consolidated statements of cash flows in 2022 include:\n•\nCash contributions to pension plans are expected to be approximately $250 million.\n•\nCapital expenditures are expected to be approximately $2.2 billion.\n•\nCash expenditures related to the Digital Acceleration program are expected to be $250 million in 2022.\n•\nCash outflows related to the Company's 2020 Restructuring Program, including restructuring implementation costs, are expected to be approximately $175 million.\n•\nCash dividends from equity companies are expected to increase following increased equity earnings in 2021.\n47\nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\nThe Company had cash and cash equivalents of $2,988 million at December 31, 2021 and $5,104 million at December 31, 2020, of which $1,745 million at December 31, 2021 and $862 million at December 31, 2020, was held by subsidiaries in foreign countries, including United States territories. For each of its foreign subsidiaries, the Company makes an assertion regarding the amount of earnings intended for permanent reinvestment, with the balance available to be repatriated to the United States.\nThe cash held by foreign subsidiaries for permanent reinvestment is generally used to finance the subsidiaries' operational activities and future foreign investments. Dow has the ability to repatriate additional funds to the U.S., which could result in an adjustment to the tax liability for foreign withholding taxes, foreign and/or U.S. state income taxes and the impact of foreign currency movements. At December 31, 2021, management believed that sufficient liquidity was available in the United States. The Company has and expects to continue repatriating certain funds from its non-U.S. subsidiaries that are not needed to finance local operations; however, these particular repatriation activities have not and are not expected to result in a significant incremental tax liability to the Company.\nThe Company’s cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities, as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows, are summarized in the following table:\n48\nCash Flows from Operating Activities\nCash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2021 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings and dividends from equity method investments, which were partially offset by cash used for working capital requirements, pension contributions and performance-based compensation payments. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2020 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings, cash receipts related to an advance payment from a customer and the Nova ethylene asset matter, dividends from equity method investments and working capital improvements, which were partially offset by pension contributions. Cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in 2019 was primarily driven by the Company's cash earnings, dividends from equity method investments, working capital improvements, cash receipts related to an advance payment from a customer and the Nova ethylene asset matter, which were partially offset by performance-based compensation payments and pension contributions.\nCash provided by (used for) operating activities from discontinued operations primarily related to cash payments and receipts the Company had with DuPont and Corteva that related to certain agreements and matters related to the separation from DowDuPont. See Note 3 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nCash Flows from Investing Activities\nCash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2021 was primarily for capital expenditures and purchases of investments and previously leased assets, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments. Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2020 was primarily for capital expenditures, purchases of investments, investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates (related to Sadara) and acquisitions of property and businesses, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and proceeds from sales of property and businesses. Cash used for investing activities from continuing operations in 2019 was primarily for capital expenditures, purchases of investments and investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates, which were partially offset by proceeds from sales and maturities of investments.\nThe Company loaned Sadara $333 million in 2020 and $473 million in 2019. As a result of Sadara's debt re-profiling completed in the first quarter of 2021, the Company did not provide any shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara in 2021. See Notes 12 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nThe Company's capital expenditures related to continuing operations were $1,501 million in 2021, $1,252 million in 2020 and $1,961 million in 2019. Capital spending was higher in 2021 as the Company ramped up its growth projects and investments to keep pace with demand recovery. The Company expects capital spending in 2022 to be approximately $2.2 billion.\n49\nCapital spending in recent years has included an expansion of the Company's new ethylene production facility in Freeport, Texas, which commenced operations in 2020, bringing the facility's total ethylene capacity to 2,000 kilotonnes per annum and making it the largest ethylene cracker in the world; the addition of a furnace to the Company's ethylene production facility in Alberta, Canada, which commenced operations in 2021; the retrofit of one of the Company's Louisiana steam crackers with Dow's proprietary fluidized catalytic dehydrogenation (\"FCDh\") technology to produce on-purpose propylene and the addition of a new specialty alkoxylation reactor in Plaquemine, Louisiana, which are both expected to be completed in the second half of 2022; and the addition of an integrated MDI distillation and prepolymers facility at its site in Freeport, Texas, which is expected to be completed in 2023.\nCash used for investing activities from discontinued operations in 2019 was primarily for capital expenditures, partially offset by proceeds from the sales of property, businesses and ownership interests in nonconsolidated affiliates.\nCash Flows from Financing Activities\nCash used for financing activities from continuing operations in 2021 included payments on long-term debt and transaction financing, debt issuance and other costs, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock. In addition, Dow Inc. included cash outflows for dividends paid to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock and TDCC included cash outflows for dividends paid to Dow Inc. Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in 2020 included payments on long-term debt, changes in short-term notes payable and transaction financing, debt issuance and other costs, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. In addition, Dow Inc. included cash outflows for dividends paid to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock and TDCC included cash outflows for dividends paid to Dow Inc. Cash used for financing activities from continuing operations in 2019 included payments on long-term debt and dividends paid to DowDuPont, which were partially offset by proceeds from issuance of long-term debt. In addition, Dow Inc. received cash as part of the separation from DowDuPont, which was more than offset by dividends paid to stockholders and purchases of treasury stock. See Notes 15 and 18 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information related to the issuance and retirement of debt and the Company's share repurchases and dividends.\nCash used for financing activities from discontinued operations in 2019 primarily related to distributions to noncontrolling interests and employee taxes paid for share-based payment arrangements.\nNon-GAAP Cash Flow Measures\nFree Cash Flow\nDow defines free cash flow as \"Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations,\" less capital expenditures. Under this definition, free cash flow represents the cash generated by Dow from operations after investing in its asset base. Free cash flow, combined with cash balances and other sources of liquidity, represents the cash available to fund obligations and provide returns to shareholders. Free cash flow is an integral financial measure used in the Company's financial planning process.\nOperating EBITDA and Pro Forma Operating EBITDA\nDow defines Operating EBITDA (for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020) as earnings (i.e., \"Income from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation and amortization, excluding the impact of significant items. Pro forma Operating EBITDA (for the year ended December 31, 2019) is defined as earnings (i.e. \"Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, depreciation and amortization, plus pro forma adjustments, excluding the impact of significant items.\nCash Flow Conversion (Operating EBITDA or Pro Forma Operating EBITDA to Cash Flow From Operations)\nDow defines cash flow conversion (Operating EBITDA or pro forma Operating EBITDA to cash flow from operations) as \"Cash provided by operating activities - continuing operations,\" divided by Operating EBITDA or pro forma Operating EBITDA. Management believes cash flow conversion is an important financial metric as it helps the Company determine how efficiently it is converting its earnings into cash flow.\nThese financial measures are not recognized in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (\"U.S. GAAP\") and should not be viewed as alternatives to U.S. GAAP financial measures of performance. All companies do not calculate non-GAAP financial measures in the same manner and, accordingly, Dow's definitions may not be consistent with the methodologies used by other companies.\n50\n1.\nFree cash flow for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a $1 billion elective pension contribution.\n1.\nOperating EBIT, depreciation and amortization and Operating EBITDA for the year ended December 31, 2019 is presented on a pro forma basis.\n2.\nPro forma adjustments for the year ended December 31, 2019 include: (1) the margin impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont and (2) the elimination of the impact of events directly attributable to the Merger, internal reorganization and business realignment, separation, distribution and other related transactions (e.g., one-time transaction costs).\n3.\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 includes costs associated with the Company's digital acceleration program; restructuring, implementation costs and asset related charges - net; a loss on early extinguishment of debt; a gain on a previous divestiture, litigation related charges, awards and adjustments; and indemnification and other transaction related costs. The year ended December 31, 2020 includes integration and separation costs, restructuring, implementation costs and asset related charges - net, a gain on a warranty accrual adjustment of an exited business, a net gain on divestitures and asset sale, a gain related to a legal matter with Nova, a loss on early extinguishment of debt and a loss associated with agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes integration and separation costs, restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net, a gain on a warranty accrual adjustment of an exited business, environmental charges, a loss related to previous divestitures, a loss on early extinguishment of debt, a net gain related to litigation matters and a loss associated with agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva as part of the separation and distribution. See Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\n4.\nCash flow conversion for the year ended December 31, 2021 reflects a $1 billion elective pension contribution.\nLiquidity & Financial Flexibility\nThe Company’s primary source of incremental liquidity is cash flows from operating activities. The generation of cash from operations and the Company's ability to access capital markets is expected to meet the Company’s cash requirements for working capital, capital expenditures, debt maturities, contributions to pension plans, dividend distributions to stockholders, share repurchases and other needs. In addition to cash from operating activities, the Company’s current liquidity sources also include TDCC's U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs, committed and uncommitted credit facilities, committed accounts receivable facilities, a U.S. retail note program (“InterNotes®”) and other debt markets.\nThe Company continues to maintain a strong financial position with all of its committed credit facilities undrawn and fully available at December 31, 2021. Cash and committed and available forms of liquidity were $12.6 billion at December 31, 2021. The Company also has no substantive long-term debt maturities due until 2026. Additional details on sources of liquidity are as follows:\n51\nCommercial Paper\nTDCC issues promissory notes under its U.S. and Euromarket commercial paper programs. TDCC had no commercial paper outstanding at December 31, 2021 and 2020. TDCC maintains access to the commercial paper market at competitive rates. Amounts outstanding under TDCC's commercial paper programs during the period may be greater or less than the amount reported at the end of the period. Subsequent to December 31, 2021, TDCC issued approximately $1.3 billion of commercial paper.\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nThe Company also has the ability to access liquidity through TDCC's committed and available credit facilities. At December 31, 2021, TDCC had total committed and available credit facilities of $8.1 billion. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on committed and available credit facilities.\nCommitted Accounts Receivable Facilities\nIn addition to the above committed credit facilities, the Company maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in the U.S. where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to $900 million, may be sold at any point in time. The Company also maintains a committed accounts receivable facility in Europe where eligible trade accounts receivable, up to €500 million, may be sold at any point in time. At December 31, 2021, there were no receivables sold under the U.S. and Europe committed accounts receivable facilities. See Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information\n.\nCompany-Owned Life Insurance\nThe Company has investments in company-owned life insurance (\"COLI\") policies, which are recorded at their cash surrender value as of each balance sheet date. The Company has the ability to monetize its investment in its COLI policies as an additional source of liquidity. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company monetized $200 million of its existing COLI policies' surrender value. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company repaid the drawdown against the cash surrender value. The Company had no outstanding monetization of its existing COLI policies' surrender value at December 31, 2021. See Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nUncommitted Credit Facilities\nThe Company has entered into various uncommitted bilateral credit arrangements as a potential source of excess liquidity. These lines can be used to support short-term liquidity needs and for general purposes, including letters of credit. The Company had no drawdowns outstanding at December 31, 2021.\nLetters of Credit\nTDCC utilizes letters of credit to support commitments made in the ordinary course of business. While the terms and amounts of letters of credit change, TDCC generally has approximately $400 million of outstanding letters of credit at any given time.\nEarly Settlement of Letters of Credit\nThe Company utilizes, from time-to-time, letters of credit discounting programs to manage and expedite the settlement of letters of credit in certain regions. These letters of credit are associated with accounts receivable and the Company retains no interest in the transferred letters of credit or receivables once sold.\nShelf Registration - U.S.\nOn July 26, 2019, Dow Inc. and TDCC filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC. The shelf indicates that Dow Inc. may offer common stock; preferred stock; depositary shares; debt securities; guarantees; warrants to purchase common stock, preferred stock and debt securities; and stock purchase contracts and stock purchase units, with pricing and availability of any such offerings depending on market conditions. The shelf also indicates that TDCC may offer debt securities, guarantees and warrants to purchase debt securities, with pricing and availability of any such offerings depending on market conditions. Also on July 26, 2019, TDCC filed a new prospectus supplement under this shelf registration to register an unlimited amount of securities for issuance under InterNotes®. The shelf registration expires on July 26, 2022. The Company expects to renew the shelf registration.\n52\nDebt\nAs the Company continues to maintain its strong balance sheet and financial flexibility, management is focused on net debt (a non-GAAP financial measure), as the Company believes this is the best representation of its financial leverage at this point in time. As shown in the following table, net debt is equal to total gross debt minus \"Cash and cash equivalents\" and \"Marketable securities.\" At December 31, 2021, net debt as a percentage of total capitalization for Dow Inc. and TDCC decreased to 37.9 percent and 37.5 percent, respectively, compared with 47.9 percent and 46.8 percent, respectively, at December 31, 2020.\n1.\nIncluded in \"Other current assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the second quarter of 2021, the Company redeemed $208 million aggregate principal amount of 3.15 percent notes due May 2024 and $811 million aggregate principal amount of 3.50 percent notes due October 2024.\nIn the third quarter of 2021, the Company completed cash tender offers for certain debt securities. In total, $1,042 million aggregate principal amount was tendered and retired. In addition, the Company voluntarily repaid $81 million of long-term debt due within one year.\nThe Company may at any time repurchase certain debt securities in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions subject to: the applicable terms under which any such debt securities were issued, certain internal approvals of the Company, and applicable laws and regulations of the relevant jurisdiction in which any such potential transactions might take place. This in no way obligates the Company to make any such repurchases nor should it be considered an offer to do so.\nTDCC’s public debt instruments and primary, private credit agreements contain, among other provisions, certain customary restrictive covenant and default provisions. TDCC’s most significant debt covenant with regard to its financial position is the obligation to maintain the ratio of its consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than 0.70 to 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\") equals or exceeds $500 million. The ratio of TDCC’s consolidated indebtedness as defined in the Revolving Credit Agreement was .40 to 1.00 at December 31, 2021. Management believes TDCC was in compliance with all of its covenants and default provisions at December 31, 2021. The Revolving Credit Agreement was extended in November 2021 to include favorable updates to the terms and conditions and matures in November 2026.\nOn April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the separation of its materials science business and Dow Inc. became the direct parent company of TDCC. In conjunction with the separation, Dow Inc. is obligated, substantially concurrently with the issuance of any guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under the Revolving Credit Agreement, to enter into a supplemental indenture with TDCC and the trustee under TDCC’s existing 2008 base indenture governing certain notes issued by TDCC. Under such supplemental indenture, Dow Inc. will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under such existing base indenture and will become subject to certain covenants and events of default under the existing base indenture.\n53\nIn addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event Dow Inc. incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $250 million or engages in any material activity or directly owns any material assets, in each case, subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Dow Inc. may, at its option, cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default.\nNo such events have occurred or have been triggered at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. See Note 15 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to TDCC’s notes payable and long-term debt activity and information on TDCC’s debt covenants and default provisions.\nWhile taking into consideration the current economic environment, management expects that the Company will continue to have sufficient liquidity and financial flexibility to meet all of its business obligations.\nCredit Ratings\nTDCC's credit ratings at January 31, 2022 were as follows:\nOn April 13, 2021, Fitch reaffirmed TDCC’s BBB+ and F2 rating, and revised its outlook to stable from negative. The decision was made as part of Fitch’s annual review process.\nOn June 10, 2021, S&P announced a credit rating upgrade for TDCC from BBB- and A-3 to BBB and A-2, maintaining stable outlook. The decision from S&P reflects the expectation for an ongoing macroeconomic recovery, the Company’s supportive financial policies and the strengthening of its operating performance in 2021 relative to 2020.\nDividends\nDow Inc.\nDow Inc. has paid dividends on a quarterly basis since the separation from DowDuPont and expects to continue to do so, subject to approval by the Board. The dividends declared by the Board align to the Company's strategy announced in 2018 of returning approximately 45 percent of operating net income\n1\nto the shareholders through the dividend and total shareholder remuneration of approximately 65 percent, when including share repurchases, over the economic cycle. The following tables provide information on dividends declared and paid to common stockholders:\n1.\nReflects Dow Inc. activity subsequent to the separation from DowDuPont.\n1.\nOperating net income is a non-GAAP measure that Dow defines as \"Net income (loss) available for Dow Inc. common stockholders,\" excluding the impact of significant items.\n54\nTDCC\nEffective with the Merger, TDCC no longer has publicly traded common stock. From the Merger Date through March 31, 2019, TDCC's common shares were owned solely by DowDuPont. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, TDCC committed to fund a portion of DowDuPont's dividends paid to common stockholders and certain governance expenses. Funding was accomplished through intercompany loans. On a quarterly basis, TDCC's Board reviewed and determined a dividend distribution to DowDuPont to settle the intercompany loans. The dividend distribution considered the level of TDCC’s earnings and cash flows and the outstanding intercompany loan balances. TDCC declared and paid dividends to DowDuPont of $535 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nEffective with the separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. TDCC has committed to fund Dow Inc.'s dividends paid to common stockholders, share repurchases and certain governance expenses. Funding is accomplished through intercompany loans. TDCC's Board reviews and determines a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. to settle the intercompany loans. For the year ended December 31, 2021, TDCC declared and paid dividends to Dow Inc. of $3,264 million ($2,233 million for the year ended December 31, 2020 and $201 million for the year ended December 31, 2019). At December 31, 2021, TDCC's intercompany loan balance with Dow Inc. was insignificant. See Note 25 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information.\nShare Repurchase Program\nDow Inc.\nOn April 1, 2019, Dow Inc.'s Board ratified the share repurchase program originally approved on March 15, 2019, authorizing up to $3.0 billion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. In 2021, Dow Inc. repurchased $1.0 billion of the Company's common stock. At December 31, 2021, approximately $1.4 billion of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases. As previously announced, the Company intends to, at a minimum, repurchase shares to cover dilution. The Company may expand share repurchases beyond dilution as favorable economic conditions develop. Any share repurchases, when coupled with the Company's dividends, is intended to implement the long-term strategy of ensuring shareholder remuneration is approximately 65 percent over the economic cycle.\nPension Plans\nThe Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and a number of other countries. In 2021, 2020 and 2019, the Company contributed $1,219 million, $299 million and $261 million to its continuing operations pension plans respectively, including contributions to fund benefit payments for its non-qualified pension plans ($1,219 million, $299 million and $266 million, including contributions to plans of discontinued operations). In the first quarter of 2021, the Company elected to contribute $1 billion to its U.S. tax-qualified pension plans, which is included in the 2021 contribution amount above. This contribution was based on the Company's funding policy, which is to contribute to defined benefit pension plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. The Company expects to contribute approximately $180 million to its pension plans in 2022.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Company announced changes to the design of its U.S. tax-qualified and non-qualified pension plans (collectively, the \"U.S. Plans\") and, effective December 31, 2023, the Company will freeze the pensionable compensation and credited service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for employees who participate in the U.S. Plans. See Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information concerning the Company’s pension plans.\nRestructuring\nThe actions related to the 2020 Restructuring Program are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of $168 million, primarily through the third quarter of 2022, consisting of severance and related benefit costs and costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including contract cancellation penalties and environmental remediation. Restructuring implementation costs, primarily decommissioning and demolition activities related to asset actions, are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $50 million, primarily through the third quarter of 2022. Restructuring implementation costs totaled $63 million in 2021.\n55\nThe Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities, which will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. See Note 6 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.\nDigital Acceleration\nIn the first quarter of 2021, Dow announced plans to further advance and expand its digitalization efforts to deliver long-term value creation, by accelerating investment in three key areas: expanding digital tools to accelerate materials science innovation; further enhancing the e-commerce buying and fulfillment experience for Dow's customers; and adopting real-time digital manufacturing insights, operational data intelligence and demand sensing to enhance the productivity and reliability of Dow’s operations. The Company expects more than $300 million in incremental annual run rate Operating EBITDA generation by the end of 2025 related to digital acceleration, with an additional one-time $100 million in structural working capital efficiency gains, driven in part by enhanced planning from digital tools. The activities related to digital acceleration are expected to result in additional cash expenditures of approximately $250 million, primarily through the end of 2022. Digital acceleration expenses totaled $169 million in 2021.\nContractual Obligations\nThe following table summarizes the Company’s contractual obligations, commercial commitments and expected cash requirements for interest at December 31, 2021. Additional information related to these obligations can be found in Notes 15, 16, 17 and 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n1.\nExcludes unamortized debt discount and issuance costs of $297 million. Includes finance lease obligations of $869 million.\n2.\nCash requirements for interest on long-term debt was calculated using current interest rates at December 31, 2021, and includes $53 million of various floating rate notes.\n3.\nIncludes imputed interest of $278 million.\n4.\nIncludes outstanding purchase orders and other commitments greater than $1 million obtained through a survey conducted within the Company.\n5.\nIncludes liabilities related to asbestos litigation, environmental remediation, legal matters and other noncurrent liabilities. In addition to these items, Dow Inc. includes liabilities related to noncurrent obligations with DuPont and Corteva. The table excludes uncertain tax positions due to uncertainties in the timing of the effective settlement of tax positions with the respective taxing authorities and deferred tax liabilities as it is impractical to determine whether there will be a cash impact related to these liabilities. The table also excludes deferred revenue as it does not represent future cash requirements arising from contractual payment obligations.\nThe Company expects to meet its contractual obligations through its normal sources of liquidity and believes it has the financial resources to satisfy these contractual obligations.\n56\nOff-Balance Sheet Arrangements\nOff-balance sheet arrangements are obligations the Company has with nonconsolidated entities related to transactions, agreements or other contractual arrangements. The Company holds variable interests in joint ventures accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company is not the primary beneficiary of these joint ventures and therefore is not required to consolidate these entities (see Note 24 to the Consolidated Financial Statements). In addition, see Note 14 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information regarding the transfer of financial assets.\nGuarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, committed accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others if specific triggering events occur. Additional information related to guarantees can be found in the “Guarantees” section of Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nSee Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for information related to fair value measurements of pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets; see Note 22 for information related to other-than-temporary impairments; and, see Note 23 for additional information concerning fair value measurements.\nOTHER MATTERS\nRecent Accounting Guidance\nSee Note 2 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for a summary of recent accounting guidance.\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires management to make judgments, assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Following are the Company’s accounting policies impacted by judgments, assumptions and estimates:\nLitigation\nThe Company is subject to legal proceedings and claims arising out of the normal course of business including product liability, patent infringement, employment matters, governmental tax and regulation disputes, contract and commercial litigation and other actions. The Company routinely assesses the legal and factual circumstances of each matter, the likelihood of any adverse outcomes to these matters, as well as ranges of probable losses. A determination of the amount of the reserves required, if any, for these contingencies is made after thoughtful analysis of each known claim. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers covering various timeframes. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies. The required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter. For further discussion, see Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. (\"Amchem\"). Each year, Ankura Consulting Group, LLC (\"Ankura\") performs a review for Union Carbide based upon historical asbestos claims, resolution and asbestos-related defense and processing costs, through the terminal year of 2049. Union Carbide compares current asbestos claim and resolution activity, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, to the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the asbestos-related liability continues to be appropriate.\nFor additional information, see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings; Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations; and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n57\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe Company determines the costs of environmental remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on evaluations of current law and existing technologies. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies. The recorded liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress, or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. At December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued obligations of $1,220 million for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs, including $237 million for the remediation of Superfund sites. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. For further discussion, see Environmental Matters in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations and Notes 1 and 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\nGoodwill\nThe Company performs goodwill impairment testing at the reporting unit level. Reporting units are the level at which discrete financial information is available and reviewed by business management on a regular basis. The Company tests goodwill for impairment annually (in the fourth quarter), or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit has declined below its carrying value. Goodwill is evaluated for impairment using qualitative and/or quantitative testing procedures. The separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019, did not impact the composition of the Company's six reporting units: Coatings & Performance Monomers, Consumer Solutions, Hydrocarbons & Energy, Industrial Solutions, Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals. The ECP businesses received as part of the separation from DowDuPont are included in the Hydrocarbons & Energy and Packaging and Specialty Plastics reporting units. At December 31, 2021, goodwill was carried by five out of six of the Company's reporting units.\nThe Company has the option to first perform qualitative testing to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value. Qualitative factors assessed at the Company level include, but are not limited to, GDP growth rates, long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, equity and credit market activity, discount rates, foreign exchange rates and overall financial performance. Qualitative factors assessed at the reporting unit level include, but are not limited to, changes in industry and market structure, competitive environments, planned capacity and new product launches, cost factors such as raw material prices, and financial performance of the reporting unit. If the Company chooses not to complete qualitative testing for a given reporting unit or if the initial assessment indicates that it is more likely than not that the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is required.\nQuantitative testing requires the fair value of the reporting unit to be compared with its carrying value. If the reporting unit's carrying value exceeds its fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the difference. The Company utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units. This valuation technique has been selected by management as the most meaningful valuation method due to the limited number of market comparables for the Company's reporting units. However, where market comparables are available, the Company includes EBIT/EBITDA multiples as part of the reporting unit valuation analysis. The discounted cash flow valuations are completed using the following key assumptions: projected revenue growth rates or compounded annual growth rates, discount rates, tax rates, terminal values, currency exchange rates, and forecasted long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices, by geographic region and by year, which include the Company's key feedstocks as well as natural gas and crude oil (due to its correlation to naphtha). Currency exchange rates and long-term hydrocarbon and energy prices are established for the Company as a whole and applied consistently to all reporting units, while revenue growth rates, discount rates and tax rates are established by reporting unit to account for differences in business fundamentals and industry risk. These key assumptions drive projected EBIT/EBITDA and EBIT/EBITDA margins, which are key elements of management’s internal control over the reporting unit valuation analysis.\n2021 Goodwill Impairment Testing\nIn 2021, there were no events or changes in circumstances that warranted interim goodwill impairment testing. In the fourth quarter of 2021, qualitative testing was performed for all reporting units carrying goodwill. Based on the results of the qualitative testing, the Company did not perform quantitative testing on any reporting units. For the qualitative testing, management considered factors at both the Company level and the reporting unit level. Based on the qualitative testing for the reporting units, management concluded it is not more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit.\n58\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefits\nThe amounts recognized in the consolidated financial statements related to pension and other postretirement benefits are determined from actuarial valuations. Inherent in these valuations are assumptions including expected return on plan assets, discount rates at which the liabilities could have been settled at December 31, 2021, rate of increase in future compensation levels, mortality rates and health care cost trend rates. These assumptions are updated annually and are disclosed in Note 20 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In accordance with U.S. GAAP, actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and, therefore, affect expense recognized and obligations recorded in future periods. The U.S. pension plans represent 71 percent of the Company’s pension plan assets and 70 percent of the pension obligations.\nThe Company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the U.S. and other selected countries. Under the spot rate approach, the Company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rates from the Willis Towers Watson RATE:Link yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost; service cost and interest cost for all other plans (including all plans prior to adoption) are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations.\nThe following information relates to the U.S. plans only; a similar approach is used for the Company’s non-U.S. plans.\nThe Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on assets by performing a detailed analysis of historical and expected returns based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the Company's Investment Committee and the underlying return fundamentals of each asset class. The Company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered. The expected return of each asset class is derived from a forecasted future return confirmed by historical experience. The expected long-term rate of return is an assumption and not what is expected to be earned in any one particular year. The weighted-average long-term rate of return assumption used for determining net periodic pension expense for 2021 was 7.96 percent. The weighted-average assumption to be used for determining 2022 net periodic pension expense is 7.95 percent. Future actual pension expense will depend on future investment performance, changes in future discount rates and various other factors related to the population of participants in the Company’s pension plans.\nThe discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the Company’s U.S. plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve (based on 60th to 90th percentile high-quality corporate bond yields) to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date. The weighted average discount rate utilized to measure pension obligations increased to 3.04 percent at December 31, 2021, from 2.71 percent at December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2021, the U.S. tax-qualified plans were underfunded on a projected benefit obligation basis by $2,585 million. The underfunded amount decreased $3,288 million compared with December 31, 2020. The decrease in the underfunded amount in 2021 was primarily due to the impact of higher discount rates, overall favorable asset returns, a $1 billion contribution to the U.S. tax-qualified pension plans, and plan design changes.\nThe assumption for the long-term rate for compensation levels for the U.S. tax-qualified plans was unchanged. The Company uses a generational mortality table to determine the duration of its pension and other postretirement obligations.\n59\nThe following discussion relates to the Company’s significant pension plans.\nThe Company bases the determination of pension expense on a market-related valuation of plan assets that reduces year-to-year volatility. This market-related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over a five-year period from the year in which they occur. Investment gains or losses for this purpose represent the difference between the expected return calculated using the market-related value of plan assets and the actual return based on the market value of plan assets. Since the market-related value of plan assets recognizes gains or losses over a five-year period, the future value will be impacted when previously deferred gains or losses are recorded. Over the life of the plans, both gains and losses have been recognized and amortized. At December 31, 2021, net gains of $1,628 million remain to be recognized in the calculation of the market-related value of plan assets. These net gains will result in decreases in future pension expense as they are recognized in the market-related value of assets.\nThe net increase in the market-related value of assets due to the recognition of prior gains is presented in the following table:\nExclusive of one-time curtailment gains recognized in 2021, the Company expects pension expense to decrease in 2022 by approximately $25 million. The decrease is driven by a reduction in the amortization of actuarial losses.\nA 25 basis point increase or decrease in the long-term return on assets assumption would change the Company’s total pension expense for 2022 by $62 million. A 25 basis point increase in the discount rate assumption would decrease the Company's total pension expense for 2022 by $53 million. A 25 basis point decrease in the discount rate assumption would increase the Company's total pension expense for 2022 by $55 million. A 25 basis point change in the long-term return and discount rate assumptions would have an immaterial impact on the other postretirement benefit expense for 2022.\nIncome Taxes\nDeferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities, applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse. Based on the evaluation of available evidence, both positive and negative, the Company recognizes future tax benefits, such as net operating loss carryforwards and tax credit carryforwards, to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered to be more likely than not.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had a net deferred tax asset balance of $852 million, after valuation allowances of $1,391 million.\nIn evaluating the ability to realize the deferred tax assets, the Company relies on, in order of increasing subjectivity, taxable income in prior carryback years, the future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences, tax planning strategies and forecasted taxable income using historical and projected future operating results.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had deferred tax assets for tax loss and tax credit carryforwards of $1,784 million, $864 million of which is subject to expiration in the years 2022 through 2026. In order to realize the deferred tax assets for operating tax loss and tax credit carryforwards, the Company needs taxable income of approximately $25,034 million across multiple jurisdictions. The taxable income needed to realize the deferred tax assets for operating tax loss and tax credit carryforwards that are subject to expiration from 2022 through 2026 is approximately $14,748 million.\nThe Company files tax returns in multiple jurisdictions and is subject to examination by taxing authorities throughout the world. Tax authorities have the ability to review and challenge matters that could be subject to differing interpretation of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of tax attributes. The ultimate resolution of such uncertainties could last\n60\nseveral years. When an uncertain tax position is identified, the Company considers and interprets complex tax laws and regulations    in order to determine the need for recognizing a provision in its financial statements. Significant judgment is required in determining the timing and measurement of uncertain tax positions. The Company utilizes internal and external expertise in interpreting tax laws to support the Company's tax positions. The Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. At December 31, 2021, the Company had uncertain tax positions for both domestic and foreign issues of $580 million and $502 million for interest and penalties.\nEnvironmental Matters\nEnvironmental Policies\nDow is committed to world-class environmental, health and safety (“EH&S”) performance, as demonstrated by industry-leading performance, a long-standing commitment to Responsible Care®, and a strong commitment to achieve the Company's 2025 Sustainability Goals – goals that set the standard for sustainability in the chemical industry by focusing on improvements in the Company’s local corporate citizenship and product stewardship, and by actively pursuing methods to reduce its environmental impact.\nTo meet the Company’s public commitments, as well as the stringent laws and government regulations related to environmental protection and remediation to which its global operations are subject, the Company has well-defined policies, requirements and management systems. The Company's EH&S Management System (“EMS”) defines the “who, what, when and how” needed for the businesses to achieve the Company’s policies, requirements, performance objectives, leadership expectations and public commitments. To ensure effective utilization, the EMS is integrated into a company-wide management system for EH&S, Operations, Quality and Human Resources.\nThe Company believes third-party verification and transparent public reporting are cornerstones of world-class EH&S performance and building public trust. Numerous Dow sites in Europe, Latin America, Asia Pacific and the U.S. & Canada have received third-party verification of the Company’s compliance with Responsible Care® and with outside specifications such as ISO-14001. The Company continues to be a global champion of Responsible Care® and has worked to broaden the application and impact of Responsible Care® around the world through engagement with suppliers, customers and joint venture partners.\nDow's EH&S policies help to ensure the Company achieves its annual health and safety performance targets and the Company seeks to continuously improve on these targets through process and personal safety project implementations. Improvement in these areas, as well as environmental compliance, remains a top management priority, as the Company continues to implement its 2025 Sustainability Goals and progressive, multi-decade sustainability targets announced in 2020 that include advancing a circular economy and climate protection. Progress is reviewed regularly by management and with the Environment, Health, Safety & Technology Committee of the Board.\nDetailed information on Dow’s performance regarding environmental matters and goals is accessible through the Company's Science & Sustainability webpage at\nwww.dow.com/sustainability\n. Dow's website and its content are not deemed incorporated by reference into this report.\nChemical Security\nPublic and political attention continues to be placed on the protection of critical infrastructure, including the chemical industry, from security threats. Terrorist attacks, natural disasters and cyber incidents have increased global concerns about the security and safety of chemical production and distribution. Many, including the Company and the American Chemistry Council, have called for uniform risk-based and performance-based national standards for securing the U.S. chemical industry. U.S. regulations set forth risk-based and performance-based standards that must be met at U.S. Coast Guard-regulated facilities. The Company is subject to U.S. Chemical Plant Security regulations and Chemical Facility Anti-Terrorism Standards which were implemented by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The Company is also subject to the requirements of the Rail Transportation Security Rule issued by the U.S. Transportation Security Administration. The Company continues to support uniform risk-based national standards for securing the chemical industry.\nSince 1988, the Company has maintained a comprehensive, multi-level security plan that focuses on security, emergency planning, preparedness and response. This plan, which has been activated in response to significant world and national events, is reviewed on an annual basis. The Company continues to improve its security plans, placing emphasis on the safety of Dow communities and people by being prepared to meet risks at any level and to\n61\naddress both internal and external identifiable risks. The security plan includes regular vulnerability assessments, security audits, mitigation efforts and physical security upgrades designed to reduce vulnerability. The Company’s security plans are also designed to avert interruptions of normal business operations that could materially and adversely affect the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe Company played a key role in the development and implementation of the American Chemistry Council’s Responsible Care® Security Code (\"Security Code\"), which requires that all aspects of security – including facility, transportation and cyberspace – be assessed and gaps addressed. Through the global implementation of the Security Code, the Company has permanently heightened the level of security – not just in the United States, but worldwide. The Company employs several hundred employees and contractors in its Emergency Services and Security department worldwide. In 2019, the Company established its Global Security Operations Center (\"GSOC\") to provide 24-hour/day, 365-day/year real-time monitoring of global risks to Dow assets and people. The GSOC employs state-of-the-art social media monitoring, threat reporting and geo-fencing capabilities to analyze global risks and report those risks, facilitating decision-making and actions to prevent Dow crises.\nThrough the implementation of the Security Code, including voluntary security enhancements and upgrades, the Company is well-positioned to comply with U.S. chemical facility regulations and other regulatory security frameworks. The Company participates with the American Chemistry Council to periodically review and update the Security Code.\nThe Company continues to work collaboratively across the supply chain on Responsible Care®, supply chain design, emergency preparedness, shipment visibility and transportation of hazardous materials. The Company cooperated with public and private entities to lead the implementation of advanced tank car design, and track and trace technologies. Further, the Company’s Distribution Risk Review process addresses potential threats in all modes of transportation across the Company’s supply chain. To reduce vulnerabilities, the Company maintains security measures that meet or exceed regulatory and industry security standards in all areas in which they operate.\nThe Company's initiatives relative to chemical security, emergency preparedness and response, Community Awareness and Emergency Response and crisis management are implemented consistently at all Dow sites on a global basis. Each Dow site has established outreach programs designed to engage community stakeholders with objectives centered around awareness of Dow operations, products, and efforts to protect worker and community health and the environment. These programs also educate community members on emergency planning and response, emissions and waste, future site plans to reduce waste and emissions, and process safety systems. Finally, these outreach efforts establish an opportunity for Dow site leaders to hear about community stakeholder expectations and address questions and concerns about safety, health, environmental or other issues. The Company participates with chemical associations globally and participates as an active member of the U.S. delegation to the G7 Global Partnership Sub-Working Group on Chemical Security and in positions of leadership in the U.S. Chemical Sector Coordinating Council.\nClimate Change\nClimate change matters for the Company are likely to be driven by several categories of risks related to the transition to a lower-carbon economy (“Transition Risks”) and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change (“Physical Risks”).\nTransition Risks\nTransition Risks include carbon pricing mechanisms, transition to lower greenhouse gas emissions technology, increased cost of raw materials, and mandates on and regulation of existing products and services. Carbon pricing is a market-based strategy to address climate change by putting a monetary value on greenhouse gas emissions, allowing for the costs of climate impacts and opportunities for low-carbon energy options to be reflected in production and consumption choices. Approximately 35 percent of Dow’s Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions are generated from operations in Canada and the European Union (“EU”) where carbon pricing is already in place. As part of the European Green Deal, the European Commission proposed a 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target of at least 55 percent below 1990 levels, with a goal for the EU to be carbon neutral by 2050. In China, an emissions trading system, initially proposed to cover the power sector only, is expected to gradually expand to cover a total of eight sectors, including the petrochemical and chemical industries, though no specific timeline for implementation and expansion has been outlined.\nThese carbon pricing mechanisms will not only increase Dow’s direct costs to operate but will also result in increased energy costs. Dow mitigates the direct cost impact of existing regulation through research and\n62\ndevelopment projects designed to increase energy efficiency, and capital investment projects that will reduce the Company’s energy usage and carbon footprint. The Company is also exploring options for carbon capture, utilization and storage (“CCUS”) and electrification of Dow’s processes. Dow sees CCUS as a mechanism to help bridge the time period between the onset of increased carbon regulation and the technology available to economically reduce Dow’s greenhouse gas emissions. Dow also incorporates a theoretical internal carbon price into its business planning and risk management strategies. This theoretical price of carbon is also included in internal calculations used for prioritizing capital projects. Ultimately the goal of utilizing an internal carbon price is to mitigate the risk of Dow’s carbon exposure to help ensure future resiliency.\nPhysical Risks\nOperationally, climate change may result in more frequent severe weather events, potential changes in precipitation patterns and extreme variability in weather patterns, which can disrupt operations. Several of Dow’s production facilities are located in water-scarce areas and water shortages could impact normal production. Changes in average precipitation could have an impact on the availability and price of water. The Company has engineered susceptible facilities, particularly on the U.S. Gulf Coast, to better withstand severe weather and rising sea levels, and continues to study the long-term implications of changing climate parameters on water availability, plant siting issues and other impacts. Preparedness plans are developed that detail actions needed in the event of severe weather. These measures have historically been in place and these activities and associated costs are driven by normal operational preparedness.\nClimate Action\nThe transition to a low-carbon economy remains one of society's fundamental challenges. The Company continues to progress toward its defined 2025 Sustainability Goals, which are the foundation of Dow's efforts to help lead the transition to a sustainable planet and society, and is taking further action to lessen its carbon impact moving forward. In 2020, the Company announced a new, multi-decade target to reduce its net annual greenhouse gas emissions by 5 million metric tons by 2030, compared with its 2020 baseline, a reduction of approximately 15 percent, and announced its intention to be carbon neutral by 2050 (Scopes 1+2+3, as defined by the Greenhouse Gas Protocol, plus product benefits).\nTo achieve the 2030 carbon reduction target, Dow developed a climate protection action plan which includes the following elements:\n•\nOptimizing energy efficiency of facilities and processes\n•\nIncreasing renewables in purchased power mix\n•\nInvestments in CCUS\n•\nDeveloping low-carbon technologies for emission reductions\n•\nDeploying materials to enable greenhouse gas emissions reductions for customers and industries\nThe action plan has resulted in new and expanded renewable power purchase agreements. In 2020, Dow increased its existing access to renewable power by more than 50 percent, to over 800 megawatts of renewable power, exceeding its 2025 Sustainability Goal target of 750 megawatts. The Company also initiated a joint development agreement with Shell to develop electrified cracking technology, powered by clean energy.\nIn 2021, Dow announced additional renewable and cleaner power agreements that increase Dow's access to over 850 megawatts of renewable power and are expected to reduce Scope 2 emissions by more than 600,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year. Dow also announced a plan to build the world’s first net-zero carbon emissions (with respect to Scope 1 and 2 carbon dioxide emissions, including technology advancements) site in Alberta, Canada, which will decarbonize 20 percent of Dow’s global ethylene capacity while growing polyethylene supply, with expected completion by 2030. At Dow's largest European manufacturing site in Terneuzen, The Netherlands, the Company has outlined a multi-generational plan to reduce current carbon emissions at the site by more than 40 percent by 2030, as part of the Company's goal to reduce Company-wide carbon emissions an additional 15 percent by 2030, and to be carbon neutral by 2050. Other steps the Company will take to achieve its 2030 greenhouse gas emissions reduction target include: procuring more renewable energy at multiple sites, modernizing Louisiana Operations energy assets, completing U.S. Gulf Coast flare recovery projects and advancing silicones feedstock capabilities in Brazil. The Company expects to allocate approximately $1 billion of capital expenditures annually to decarbonize its global asset base in a phased, site-by-site approach while driving growth.\n63\nThe Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (“TCFD”) has developed a framework to help organizations more effectively disclose climate-related risks and opportunities through existing reporting processes. Dow’s 2020 ESG Report includes disclosures aligned to the TCFD framework, which includes four core pillars: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. The Company intends to meet its commitment to fully implement the recommendations of the TCFD as part of the Company’s 2021 ESG Report, to be published in 2022.\nAdvancing a Circular Economy\nTransitioning to a circular economy is vital to both preserving and protecting Earth’s natural resources and to the success of Dow's businesses. To help advance a circular economy, Dow invests in new product technology, value chain partnerships, business models and waste management infrastructure to discover and scale sustainable solutions that extend the useful life of materials and the resources that are used to make them. In 2020, Dow announced \"stop the waste\" and \"close the loop\" goals to address plastic waste.\nDow's “stop the waste” goal is the Company's commitment to invest and/or collaborate in key technologies and infrastructure to significantly increase global recycling. As part of this goal, Dow intends to enable 1 million metric tons of plastic to be collected, reused or recycled through direct actions and partnerships by 2030. Dow will further \"stop the waste\" through application development, where more recycled plastics can be incorporated into key applications; through critical partnerships such as Circulate Capital and the Alliance to End Plastic Waste; and through incorporating waste into advanced recycling technologies.\nDow continues to look for market applications for recycled plastics to keep plastic out of landfills. One way to help stop the flow of this waste is to use recycled polymer modified asphalt for roads, parking lots, and other pavement. Polymer modified asphalt (\"PMA\") is a proven solution for making better pavement. Dow's ELVALOY™ Reactive Elastomeric Terpolymer products have been enhancing PMAs for more than 30 years, resulting in excellent performance, long service life, and lower life cycle costs compared to conventional, neat asphalt.\nDow's “close the loop” goal is the Company's commitment to work directly with its customers, brand owners and the value chain to help customers redesign and promote reusable or recyclable packaging applications where there is a clear environmental benefit and enable 100 percent of Dow products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable by 2035. Today, Dow enables approximately 80 percent of its products sold into packaging applications to be reusable or recyclable and continues to pursue application development, packaging redesign and infrastructure improvements to deliver on the Company's 100 percent commitment.\nAs one of the world’s largest producers of plastic, Dow wants to put an end to plastic waste. Eliminating plastic waste is about more than just recycling and reusing. It is about creating innovative solutions that are sustainable and investing in the circular economy through recyclability and efficiency for plastic packaging. Dow aims to keep plastic waste out of the environment and retain its value as a resource by increasing impact through partnerships and delivering circular economy solutions.\nEnvironmental Remediation\nThe Company accrues the costs of remediation of its facilities and formerly owned facilities based on current law and regulatory requirements. The nature of such remediation can include management of soil and groundwater contamination. The accounting policies adopted to properly reflect the monetary impacts of environmental matters are discussed in Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements. To assess the impact on the financial statements, environmental experts review currently available facts to evaluate the probability and scope of potential liabilities. Inherent uncertainties exist in such evaluations primarily due to unknown environmental conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and the ability to apply remediation technologies. These liabilities are adjusted periodically as remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. The Company had an accrued liability of $983 million at December 31, 2021, related to the remediation of current or former Dow-owned sites. At December 31, 2020, the liability related to remediation was $996 million.\n64\nIn addition to current and former Dow-owned sites, under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (\"CERCLA\") and equivalent state laws (hereafter referred to collectively as \"Superfund Law\"), the Company is liable for remediation of other hazardous waste sites where the Company allegedly disposed of, or arranged for the treatment or disposal of, hazardous substances. Because Superfund Law imposes joint and several liability upon each party at a site, the Company has evaluated its potential liability in light of the number of other companies that have also been named potentially responsible parties (“PRPs”) at each site, the estimated apportionment of costs among all PRPs, and the financial ability and commitment of each to pay its expected share. The Company’s remaining liability for the remediation of Superfund sites was $237 million at December 31, 2021 ($248 million at December 31, 2020). The Company has not recorded any third-party recovery related to these sites as a receivable.\nInformation regarding environmental sites is provided below:\n1.\nDow-owned sites are sites currently or formerly owned by the Company. In the United States, remediation obligations are imposed by the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act or analogous state law. At December 31, 2021, 24 of these sites (24 sites at December 31, 2020) were formerly owned by Dowell Schlumberger, Inc., a group of companies in which the Company previously owned a 50 percent interest. The Company sold its interest in Dowell Schlumberger in 1992.\n2.\nSuperfund sites are sites, including sites not owned by the Company, where remediation obligations are imposed by Superfund Law.\nAdditional information is provided below for the Company’s Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site and Midland off-site locations (collectively, the \"Midland sites\"), as well as a Superfund site in Wood-Ridge, New Jersey, the locations for which the Company has the largest potential environmental liabilities.\nIn the early days of operations at the Midland manufacturing site, wastes were usually disposed of on-site, resulting in soil and groundwater contamination, which has been contained and managed on-site under a series of Resource Conservation and Recovery Act permits and regulatory agreements\n.\nThe Hazardous Waste Operating License for the Midland manufacturing site, issued in 2003, and renewed and replaced in September 2015, also included provisions for the Company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination from historic Midland manufacturing site operations. In January 2010, the Company, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (\"EPA\") and the State of Michigan (\"State\") entered into an Administrative Order on Consent that requires the Company to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of CERCLA. See Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further information relating to Midland off-site environmental matters.\nRohm and Haas, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a PRP at the Wood-Ridge, New Jersey Ventron/Velsicol Superfund Site, and the adjacent Berry’s Creek Study Area (\"BCSA\") (collectively, the \"Wood-Ridge sites\"). Rohm and Haas is a successor in interest to a company that owned and operated a mercury processing facility, where wastewater and waste handling resulted in contamination of soils and adjacent creek sediments. In 2018, the Berry’s Creek Study Area Potentially Responsible Party Group (“PRP Group”), consisting of over 100 PRPs, completed a Remedial Investigation/Feasibility Study for the BCSA. During that time, the EPA concluded that an “iterative or adaptive approach” was appropriate for cleaning up the BCSA. Thus, each phase of remediation will be followed by a period of monitoring to assess its effectiveness and determine if there is a need for more work. In September 2018, the EPA signed a Record of Decision (\"ROD 1\") which describes the initial phase of the EPA’s plan to clean-up the BCSA. ROD 1 will remediate waterways and major tributaries in the most contaminated part of the BCSA. The PRP Group has signed agreements with the EPA to design the selected remedy. Although there is currently much uncertainty as to what will ultimately be required to remediate the BCSA and Rohm and Haas's share of these costs has yet to be determined, the range of activities that are required in the interim Record of Decision is known in general terms.\n65\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued liabilities totaling $358 million ($370 million at December 31, 2020) for environmental remediation at the Midland and Wood-Ridge sites. In 2021, the Company spent $38 million ($53 million in 2020) for environmental remediation at the Midland and Wood-Ridge sites.\nDuring the third quarter of 2020, the Company accrued additional liabilities totaling $106 million related to environmental remediation matters resulting from the Company's evaluation of the costs required to manage remediation activities at sites Dow will permanently shut down as part of its 2020 Restructuring Program. In addition, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $50 million related to Dow Silicones' environmental matters. Net of indemnifications, the Company recognized a pretax charge of $56 million related to these environmental matters, included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income.\nDuring the third quarter of 2019, the Company accrued additional liabilities totaling $447 million related to environmental remediation matters at a number of current and historical locations. The additional accrual primarily resulted from: the culmination of long-standing negotiations and discussions with regulators and agencies, including technical studies supporting higher cost estimates for final or staged remediation plans; the Company’s evaluation of the cost required to manage remediation activities at sites affected by Dow’s separation from DowDuPont and related agreements with Corteva and DuPont; and, the Company’s review of its closure strategies and obligations to monitor ongoing operations and maintenance activities. In addition, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $48 million related to Dow Silicones’ environmental matters. Net of indemnifications, the Company recognized a pretax charge of $399 million related to these environmental matters, included in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income.\nIn total, the Company’s accrued liability for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs was $1,220 million at December 31, 2021, compared with $1,244 million at December 31, 2020. This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows.\nThe amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $158 million in 2021, $234 million in 2020 and $588 million in 2019. The amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to operating the Company's current pollution abatement facilities, excluding internal recharges, totaled $761 million in 2021, $616 million in 2020 and $677 million in 2019. Capital expenditures for environmental protection were $65 million in 2021, $80 million in 2020 and $83 million in 2019.\nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises, and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem. In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products.\n66\nThe table below provides information regarding asbestos-related claims pending against Union Carbide and Amchem based on criteria developed by Union Carbide and its external consultants:\nPlaintiffs’ lawyers often sue numerous defendants in individual lawsuits or on behalf of numerous claimants. As a result, the damages alleged are not expressly identified as to Union Carbide, Amchem or any other particular defendant, even when specific damages are alleged with respect to a specific disease or injury. In fact, there are no asbestos personal injury cases in which only Union Carbide and/or Amchem are the sole named defendants. For these reasons and based upon Union Carbide’s litigation and settlement experience, Union Carbide does not consider the damages alleged against Union Carbide and Amchem to be a meaningful factor in its determination of any potential asbestos-related liability.\nFor additional information see Part I, Item 3. Legal Proceedings and Asbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation in Note 16 to the Consolidated Financial Statements.\n67"

    "text": "The Company’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company’s results.\nThe global nature of the Company’s business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company’s foreign currency risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities. The largest exposures are denominated in European currencies, the Chinese yuan, the Japanese yen and the Thai baht, although exposures also exist in other currencies in Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa and India.\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges using interest rate swaps, “swaptions,” and exchange-traded instruments. The Company’s primary exposure is to the U.S. dollar yield curve.\nThe Company has a portfolio of equity securities derived primarily from the investment activities of its insurance subsidiaries. This exposure is managed in a manner consistent with the Company’s market risk policies and procedures.\nInherent in the Company’s business is exposure to price changes for several commodities. Some exposures can be hedged effectively through liquid tradable financial instruments. Natural gas and crude oil, along with feedstocks for ethylene and propylene production, constitute the main commodity exposures. Over-the-counter and exchange traded instruments are used to hedge these risks, when feasible.\nThe Company uses value-at-risk (“VAR”), stress testing and scenario analysis for risk measurement and control purposes. VAR estimates the maximum potential loss in fair market values, given a certain move in prices over a certain period of time, using specified confidence levels. The VAR methodology used by the Company is a variance/covariance model. This model uses a 97.5 percent confidence level and includes at least one year of historical data. The 2021 and 2020 year-end and average daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions are shown below. These amounts are immaterial relative to the total equity of the Company.\nThe Company’s daily VAR for the aggregate of all positions increased from a composite VAR of $194 million at December 31, 2020 to a composite VAR of $200 million at December 31, 2021. The interest rate VAR increased due to an increase in interest rate exposure. The equity securities VAR decreased due to a decrease in equity volatility and a decrease in equity exposure. The foreign exchange VAR increased due to an increase in managed exposures. The commodities VAR increased due to an increase in managed exposures. See Note 22 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further disclosure regarding market risk.\n68"

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 4, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matter communicated below is a matter arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that was communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.

(“DowDuPont” and effective June 3, 2019, n/k/a DuPont de Nemours, Inc. or \"DuPont\") completed the separation of its materials science business and Dow Inc. became the direct parent company of The Dow Chemical Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“TDCC” and together with Dow Inc., “Dow” or the “Company”). The separation was contemplated by the merger of equals transaction effective August 31, 2017, under the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017 (the \"Merger Agreement\"). TDCC and E. I. du Pont de Nemours and Company and its consolidated subsidiaries (“Historical DuPont”) each merged with subsidiaries of DowDuPont and, as a result, TDCC and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont (the “Merger”). Subsequent to the Merger, TDCC and Historical DuPont engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. Dow Inc. was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont to serve as the holding company for the materials science business. See Note 3 for additional information.\n83\nPrinciples of Consolidation and Basis of Presentation\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements of Dow Inc. and TDCC were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (“U.S. GAAP”) and include the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of all majority-owned subsidiaries over which Dow exercises control and, when applicable, entities for which Dow has a controlling financial interest or is the primary beneficiary. Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated in consolidation. Investments in nonconsolidated affiliates (20-50 percent owned companies or less than 20 percent owned companies over which significant influence is exercised) are primarily accounted for using the equity method.\nEffective April 1, 2019, Dow Inc. owns all of the outstanding common shares of TDCC. TDCC is deemed the predecessor to Dow Inc. and the historical results of TDCC are deemed the historical results of Dow Inc. for periods prior to and including March 31, 2019. As a result of the parent/subsidiary relationship between Dow Inc. and TDCC, and considering that the financial statements and disclosures of each company are substantially similar, the companies are filing a combined report for this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The information reflected in the report is equally applicable to both Dow Inc. and TDCC, except where otherwise noted.\nAs of the effective date and time of the distribution, DowDuPont no longer beneficially owned any equity interest in Dow and no longer consolidated Dow and its consolidated subsidiaries into its financial results. The consolidated financial results of Dow for the applicable periods presented reflect the distribution of TDCC’s agricultural sciences business (“AgCo”) and specialty products business (“SpecCo”) as discontinued operations, as well as the receipt of Historical DuPont’s ethylene and ethylene copolymers businesses (other than its ethylene acrylic elastomers business) (“ECP”) as a common control transaction from the closing of the Merger on August 31, 2017 (\"Merger Date\"). See Note 3 for additional information.\nThe Company conducts its worldwide operations through six global businesses which are organized into the following operating segments: Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the operating segments and the Company's totals. See Note 26 for additional information.\nFrom the Merger Date through the separation, transactions between DowDuPont, TDCC and Historical DuPont and their affiliates were treated as related party transactions. Transactions between TDCC and Historical DuPont primarily consisted of the sale and procurement of certain raw materials that were consumed in each company's manufacturing process. Transactions between TDCC and Dow Inc. are treated as related party transactions for TDCC. See Note 25 for additional information.\nThroughout this Annual Report on Form 10-K, unless otherwise indicated, amounts and activity are presented on a continuing operations basis.\nExcept as otherwise indicated by the context, the term \"Union Carbide\" means Union Carbide Corporation and the term \"Dow Silicones\" means Dow Silicones Corporation, both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.\nCertain reclassifications of prior period amounts have been made to conform with the current year presentation.\nUse of Estimates in Financial Statement Preparation\nThe preparation of financial statements in accordance with U.S. GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The Company’s consolidated financial statements include amounts that are based on management’s best estimates and judgments. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\nSignificant Accounting Policies\nAsbestos-Related Matters\nAccruals for asbestos-related matters, including defense and processing costs, are recorded based on an analysis of claim and resolution activity, defense spending, and pending and future claims. These accruals are assessed at each balance sheet date to determine if the asbestos-related liability remains appropriate. Accruals for asbestos-related matters are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Asbestos-related liabilities - noncurrent.” See Note 16 for additional information.\n84\nLegal Costs\nThe Company expenses legal costs as incurred, with the exception of defense and processing costs associated with asbestos-related matters.\nForeign Currency Translation\nThe local currency has been primarily used as the functional currency throughout the world. Translation gains and losses of those operations that use local currency as the functional currency are included in the consolidated balance sheets in \"Accumulated other comprehensive loss\" (\"AOCL\"). For certain subsidiaries, the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency. This occurs when the subsidiary operates in an economic environment where the products produced and sold are tied to U.S. dollar-denominated markets, or when the foreign subsidiary operates in a hyper-inflationary environment. Where the U.S. dollar is used as the functional currency, foreign currency translation gains and losses are reflected in income.\nEnvironmental Matters\nAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. These accruals are adjusted periodically as assessment and remediation efforts progress or as additional technical or legal information becomes available. Accruals for environmental liabilities are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and “Other noncurrent obligations” at undiscounted amounts. Accruals for related insurance or other third-party recoveries for environmental liabilities are recorded when it is probable that a recovery will be realized and are included in the consolidated balance sheets in “Accounts and notes receivable - Other” or \"Noncurrent receivables.\"\nEnvironmental costs are capitalized if the costs extend the life of the property, increase its capacity and/or mitigate or prevent contamination from future operations. Environmental costs are also capitalized in recognition of legal asset retirement obligations resulting from the acquisition, construction and/or normal operation of a long-lived asset. Costs related to environmental contamination treatment and cleanup are charged to expense. Estimated future incremental operations, maintenance and management costs directly related to remediation are accrued when such costs are probable and reasonably estimable.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents include time deposits and investments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase.\nFinancial Instruments\nThe Company calculates the fair value of financial instruments using quoted market prices when available. When quoted market prices are not available for financial instruments, the Company uses standard pricing models with market-based inputs that take into account the present value of estimated future cash flows.\nThe Company utilizes derivatives to manage exposures to foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rate risk. The fair values of all derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities at the balance sheet date. Changes in the fair values of these instruments are reported in income or AOCL, depending on the use of the derivative and whether the Company has elected hedge accounting treatment.\nGains and losses on derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments are recorded in AOCL until the underlying transactions are recognized in income. Gains and losses on derivative and non-derivative instruments used as hedges of the Company’s net investment in foreign operations are recorded in AOCL as part of the cumulative translation adjustment.\nGains and losses on derivatives designated and qualifying as fair value hedging instruments, as well as the offsetting losses and gains on the hedged items, are reported in income in the same accounting period. Derivatives not designated as hedging instruments are marked-to-market at the end of each accounting period with the results included in income.\n85\nInventories\nInventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. The method of determining cost for each subsidiary varies among last-in, first-out (“LIFO”); first-in, first-out (“FIFO”); and average cost, and is used consistently from year to year. At December 31, 2021, approximately\n27\npercent,\n65\npercent and\n8\npercent of the Company's inventories were accounted for under the LIFO, FIFO and average cost methods, respectively. At December 31, 2020, approximately\n30\npercent,\n58\npercent and\n12\npercent of the Company's inventories were accounted for under the LIFO, FIFO and average cost methods, respectively.\nThe Company routinely exchanges and swaps raw materials and finished goods with other companies to reduce delivery time, freight and other transportation costs. These transactions are treated as non-monetary exchanges and are valued at cost.\nProperty\nLand, buildings and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation or amortization. Property under finance lease agreements is carried at the present value of lease payments over the lease term less accumulated amortization. Depreciation is based on the estimated service lives of depreciable assets and is calculated using the straight-line method. Fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until they are removed from service. In the case of disposals, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts, and the net amounts, less proceeds from disposal, are included in income.\nImpairment and Disposal of Long-Lived Assets\nThe Company evaluates long-lived assets (property, finite-lived intangible assets and right-of-use assets) for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. When undiscounted future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover an asset’s carrying amount, the asset is written down to its fair value based on bids received from third parties or a discounted cash flow analysis based on market participant assumptions.\nLong-lived assets to be disposed of by sale, if material, are classified as held for sale and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell, and depreciation/amortization is ceased. Long-lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale are classified as held and used until they are disposed of and reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value, and depreciation/amortization is recognized over the remaining useful life of the assets.\nGoodwill and Other Intangible Assets\nThe Company records goodwill when the purchase price of a business combination exceeds the estimated fair value of net identified tangible and intangible assets acquired. Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level annually in the fourth quarter, or more frequently when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the fair value of a reporting unit has more likely than not declined below its carrying value. When testing goodwill for impairment, the Company may first assess qualitative factors. If an initial qualitative assessment identifies that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, additional quantitative testing is performed. The Company may also elect to skip the qualitative testing and proceed directly to the quantitative testing. If the quantitative testing indicates that goodwill is impaired, an impairment charge is recognized based on the difference between the reporting unit's carrying value and its fair value. The Company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow methodology to calculate the fair value of its reporting units.\nFinite-lived intangible assets such as developed technology, customer-related, trademarks, tradenames and software, are amortized over their estimated useful lives, generally on a straight-line basis for periods ranging primarily from\n3\nto\n20\nyears.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company records asset retirement obligations as incurred and reasonably estimable, including obligations for which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. The fair values of obligations are recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis and are accreted over time for the change in present value. Costs associated with the liabilities are capitalized and amortized over the estimated remaining useful life of the asset, generally for periods of\n10\nyears or less.\n86\nInvestments\nInvestments in debt securities, primarily held by the Company's insurance operations, are classified as trading, available-for-sale or held-to-maturity. Investments classified as trading are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses related to mark-to-market adjustments included in income. Those classified as available-for-sale are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses recorded in AOCL. Those classified as held-to-maturity are recorded at amortized cost. The cost of investments sold is determined by FIFO or specific identification.\nInvestments in equity securities with a readily determinable fair value are reported at fair value with unrealized gains and losses related to mark-to-market adjustments included in income. Equity securities without a readily determinable fair value are accounted for at cost, adjusted for impairments and observable price changes in orderly transactions.\nThe Company routinely reviews its investments for declines in fair value below the cost basis. When events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable, the security is written down, establishing a new cost basis.\nLeases\nThe Company determines whether a contract contains a lease at contract inception. A contract contains a lease if there is an identified asset and the Company has the right to control the asset.\nOperating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets represent the Company's right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent the Company's obligation to make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized at commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term. The Company uses the incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments, unless the implicit rate is readily determinable. If lease terms include options to extend or terminate the lease, the ROU asset and lease liability are measured based on the reasonably certain decision. Leases with a term of 12 months or less at the commencement date are not recognized on the balance sheet and are expensed as incurred.\nThe Company has lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are accounted for as a single lease component for nearly all classes of leased assets for which the Company is the lessee. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, the portfolio approach is applied to account for the operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities. In the consolidated statements of income, lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. For finance leases, interest expense is recognized on the lease liability and the ROU asset is amortized over the lease term.\nSome leasing arrangements require variable payments that are dependent upon usage or output, or may vary for other reasons, such as insurance or tax payments. Variable lease payments are recognized as incurred and are not presented as part of the ROU asset or lease liability. See Note 17 for additional information.\nRevenue\nThe Company recognizes revenue when its customer obtains control of promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration which the Company expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. To determine revenue recognition, the Company performs the following five steps: (1) identify the contract(s) with a customer, (2) identify the performance obligations in the contract, (3) determine the transaction price, (4) allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and (5) recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation. See Note 4 for additional information.\nRevenue related to the Company's insurance operations includes third-party insurance premiums, which are earned over the terms of the related insurance policies and reinsurance contracts.\nSeverance Costs\nThe Company routinely reviews its operations around the world in an effort to ensure competitiveness across its businesses and geographic regions. When the reviews result in a workforce reduction related to the shutdown of facilities or other optimization activities, severance benefits are provided to employees primarily under the Company’s ongoing benefit arrangements. These severance costs are accrued once management commits to a plan of termination and it becomes probable that employees will be entitled to benefits at amounts that can be reasonably estimated.\n87\nIntegration and Separation Costs\nThe Company classifies expenses related to the Merger and separation as \"Integration and separation costs\" in the consolidated statements of income. Merger and separation related costs include: post-Merger integration expenses, costs incurred for the separation of AgCo and SpecCo and costs related to the integration of ECP. Integration and separation costs primarily consist of financial adviser, information technology, legal, accounting, consulting and other professional advisory fees associated with preparation and execution of these activities. Integration and separation costs related to the Merger and separation were completed as of December 31, 2020.\nIncome Taxes\nThe Company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method. Under this method, deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates. The effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets or liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date. The Company uses the portfolio approach for releasing income tax effects from AOCL.\nThe Company recognizes the financial statement effects of an uncertain income tax position when it is more likely than not, based on the technical merits, that the position will be sustained upon examination. The Company accrues for other tax contingencies when it is probable that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated. The current portion of uncertain income tax positions is included in “Income taxes payable” and the long-term portion is included in “Other noncurrent obligations” in the consolidated balance sheets.\nProvision is made for taxes on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies to the extent that such earnings are not deemed to be permanently invested.\nEarnings per Common Share\nThe calculation of earnings per common share is based on the weighted-average number of the Company's common shares outstanding for the applicable period. The calculation of diluted earnings per common share reflects the effect of all potential common shares that were outstanding during the respective periods, unless the effect of doing so is antidilutive.\nAdoption of Accounting Standards\nEffective January 1, 2019, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update (\"ASU\") 2016-02, “Leases (Topic 842),” and the associated ASUs (collectively, \"Topic 842\") and added the accounting policy on leases discussed in the section above. Adoption of the new standard resulted in the recording of operating lease ROU assets and lease liabilities of $\n2.3\nbillion at January 1, 2019. The net impact to “Retained earnings” was an increase of $\n32\nmillion and was primarily a result of the recognition of a deferred gain associated with a prior sale-leaseback transaction. The impact is reflected in the \"Adoption of accounting standards\" line in the consolidated statements of equity of both Dow Inc. and TDCC. See Note 17 for additional information.\nIn addition, the consolidated financial statements reflect the impact of the adoption of ASU 2014-09, \"Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606),\" and the associated ASUs (collectively, \"Topic 606\") at January 1, 2019 by certain nonconsolidated affiliates of the Company, which were subsequently distributed as part of the separation from DowDuPont. The net impact was reflected in assets and liabilities of discontinued operations with a corresponding reduction to \"Retained earnings\" of $\n183\nmillion in the consolidated balance sheets at January 1, 2019. The impact is reflected in the \"Adoption of accounting standards\" line in the consolidated statements of equity of both Dow Inc. and TDCC.\nTDCC Dividends\nEffective with the Merger, TDCC no longer had publicly traded common stock. TDCC's common shares were owned solely by its parent company, DowDuPont, prior to separation, and TDCC's Board of Directors (\"Board\") determined whether or not there would be a dividend distribution to DowDuPont. Effective with the separation from DowDuPont, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. and TDCC's Board determines whether or not there will be a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. See Notes 18 and 25 for additional information.\n88\nNOTE 2 –\nRECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE\nRecently Adopted Accounting Guidance\nIn the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted Accounting Standards Update 2019-12, \"Income Taxes (Topic 740): Simplifying the Accounting for Income Taxes.\" The amendments simplify the accounting for income taxes by removing certain exceptions to the general principles of Topic 740, \"Income Taxes\" and improve consistent application by clarifying and amending existing guidance. The adoption of this guidance did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.\nNOTE 3 –\nSEPARATION FROM DOWDUPONT\nEffective August 31, 2017, TDCC and Historical DuPont completed the merger of equals transaction contemplated by the Merger Agreement, by and among TDCC, Historical DuPont, DowDuPont, Diamond Merger Sub, Inc. and Orion Merger Sub, Inc. Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, (i) Diamond Merger Sub, Inc. was merged with and into TDCC, with TDCC surviving the merger as a subsidiary of DowDuPont (the \"Diamond Merger\") and (ii) Orion Merger Sub, Inc. was merged with and into Historical DuPont, with Historical DuPont surviving the merger as a subsidiary of DowDuPont (the \"Orion Merger\" and, together with the Diamond Merger, the \"Mergers\"). Following the consummation of the Mergers, each of TDCC and Historical DuPont became subsidiaries of DowDuPont. Subsequent to the Merger, TDCC and Historical DuPont engaged in a series of internal reorganization and realignment steps to realign their businesses into three subgroups: agriculture, materials science and specialty products. Dow Inc. was formed as a wholly owned subsidiary of DowDuPont to serve as the holding company for the materials science business.\nOn April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the previously announced separation of its materials science business. The separation was effected by way of a pro rata distribution of all of the then-issued and outstanding shares of Dow Inc. common stock to DowDuPont stockholders of record as of the close of business, Eastern Time, on March 21, 2019 (the “Record Date”). The shareholders of record of DowDuPont received one share of Dow Inc. common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, for every three shares of DowDuPont common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, held as of the Record Date. No fractional shares of Dow Inc. common stock were issued. Instead, cash in lieu of any fractional shares was paid to DowDuPont registered shareholders. The number of shares of Dow Inc. common stock issued on April 1, 2019 was\n748.8\nmillion shares. Dow Inc. is now an independent, publicly traded company and Dow Inc. common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “DOW.” Dow Inc. common stock began regular-way trading on April 2, 2019, the first day following the distribution.\nEffective April 1, 2019, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. As of the effective date and time of the distribution, DowDuPont did not beneficially own any equity interest in Dow and no longer consolidated Dow and its consolidated subsidiaries into its financial results. Beginning in the second quarter of 2019, Dow’s consolidated financial results reflect the results of Dow Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries - that is, TDCC after giving effect to the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo and the receipt of ECP. The consolidated financial results of Dow for periods prior to April 1, 2019, reflect the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo as discontinued operations for each period presented as well as reflect the receipt of ECP as a common control transaction from the closing of the Merger on August 31, 2017.\nOn April 1, 2019, Dow Inc. received a cash contribution of $\n2,024\nmillion from DowDuPont as part of the internal reorganization and business realignment steps between Dow Inc., TDCC and DowDuPont. Dow Inc. recognized a reduction to \"Retained earnings\" of $\n14,806\nmillion in 2019 as a result of the cash contribution, the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo, and other separation related adjustments. TDCC recognized a reduction to \"Retained earnings\" of $\n16,009\nmillion in 2019 as a result of the distribution of AgCo and SpecCo.\nReceipt of ECP\nAs the receipt of ECP was accounted for as a transfer between entities under common control, the consolidated financial statements have been retrospectively adjusted to reflect the receipt of ECP from the closing of the Merger on August 31, 2017. All intercompany transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\n89\nDistribution of AgCo and SpecCo\nUpon distribution, the Company retrospectively adjusted the previously issued consolidated financial statements and presented AgCo and SpecCo as discontinued operations based on the guidance in ASC 205-20 “Discontinued Operations” (“ASC 205-20”).\nThe results of operations of AgCo and SpecCo are presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income and are summarized in the following table:\n1. Results through March 31, 2019.\nAgreements Related to the Separation and Distribution\nIn connection with the separation, Dow Inc. entered into certain agreements with DuPont and/or Corteva, Inc. (\"Corteva\"), including the following: Separation and Distribution Agreement, Tax Matters Agreement and Employee Matters Agreement (collectively, the \"Agreements\"). In addition to establishing the terms of the separation, the Agreements provide a framework for Dow’s interaction with DuPont and Corteva after the separation and also provide for the allocation among Dow, DuPont and Corteva of assets, liabilities and obligations attributable to periods prior to, at and after the completion of the separation. The Agreements also contain certain indemnity and/or cross-indemnity provisions that are intended to set forth each party’s respective rights, responsibilities and obligations for matters subject to indemnification. Except in certain instances, the parties’ indemnification obligations are uncapped. Certain indemnification obligations will be subject to reduction by insurance proceeds or other third-party proceeds of the indemnified party that reduces the amount of the loss. In addition, indemnifiable losses will be subject to, in certain cases, “de minimis” threshold amounts and, in certain cases, deductible amounts.\nThe impacts of indemnifications and other post-separation matters relating to the Agreements are primarily reflected in the consolidated financial statements of Dow Inc. In 2019, the Company recorded pretax charges related to the Agreements of $\n69\nmillion in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" and $\n24\nmillion in \"Integration and separation costs\" in the consolidated statements of income of Dow Inc., related to Corporate.\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had\nno\nassets ($\n77\nmillion at December 31, 2020) included in \"Other current assets\" and $\n20\nmillion ($\n33\nmillion at December 31, 2020) included in \"Noncurrent receivables\" and liabilities of $\n148\nmillion ($\n412\nmillion at December 31, 2020) included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and $\n39\nmillion ($\n46\nmillion at December 31, 2020) included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets of Dow Inc. Any adjustments to these assets and liabilities in subsequent periods will be recorded in Dow Inc.'s results of operations.\n90\nIn addition, the Company deferred approximately $\n400\nmillion of the cash distribution received from DowDuPont at separation and recorded an associated liability with an offset to \"Retained earnings\" in the consolidated balance sheets of Dow Inc. At December 31, 2021, $\n15\nmillion ($\n103\nmillion at December 31, 2020) of this liability was recorded in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and $\n96\nmillion ($\n96\nmillion at December 31, 2020) was recorded in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets of Dow Inc. In the fourth quarter of 2021, due to changes in certain underlying exposures, Dow Inc. reversed $\n46\nmillion of the liability. Based on notices received in the fourth quarter of 2020, Dow Inc. reversed $\n177\nmillion of the liability. The impact of the reversals are reflected in the \"Common control transaction\" line in the consolidated statements of equity of Dow Inc. The final resolution of the remaining liability is uncertain and any subsequent adjustments to the carrying value of this liability will be reflected in equity of Dow Inc.\nIn 2021, Dow Inc. made net cash payments of $\n60\nmillion ($\n18\nmillion in 2020 and $\n215\nmillion in 2019) related to the Agreements, recorded in \"Cash flows from operating activities - discontinued operations\" in the Dow Inc. consolidated statements of cash flows. The Company also received $\n144\nmillion in 2021 (insignificant in 2020 and $\n98\nmillion in 2019) related to the Agreements, recorded in \"Other assets and liabilities, net\" within \"Cash flows from operating activities - continuing operations\" in the Dow Inc. consolidated statements of cash flows.\nContinuing Involvement\nThe Company has certain product and service agreements with DuPont and Corteva that were considered intercompany transactions prior to the separation, but are trade transactions subsequent to the separation. These transactions have been retrospectively reclassified as trade transactions in the consolidated financial statements. Based on the Company’s assessment of the specific factors identified in ASC Topic 205, “Presentation of Financial Statements,” the Company concluded that these agreements do not constitute significant continuing involvement in AgCo or SpecCo.\nIntegration and Separation Costs\nIntegration and separation costs, which reflect costs related to post-Merger integration and business separation activities, were $\n239\nmillion in 2020 and $\n1,063\nmillion and $\n1,039\nmillion for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively, in 2019. Integration and separation costs related to post-Merger integration and business separation activities were completed as of December 31, 2020.\nNOTE 4 –\nREVENUE\nThe majority of the Company's revenue is derived from product sales. In 2021,\n99\npercent of the Company's revenue related to product sales (\n99\npercent in 2020 and\n98\npercent in 2019). The remaining sales were primarily related to the Company's insurance operations and licensing of patents and technologies.\nProduct Sales\nProduct sales consist of sales of the Company's products to manufacturers and distributors. The Company considers order confirmations or purchase orders, which in some cases are governed by master supply agreements, to be contracts with a customer. Product sale contracts are generally short-term contracts where the time between order confirmation and satisfaction of all performance obligations is less than one year. However, the Company has some long-term contracts which can span multiple years.\nRevenues from product sales are recognized when the customer obtains control of the product, which occurs at a point in time, usually upon shipment, with payment terms typically in the range of 30 to 60 days after invoicing, depending on business and geographic region. When the Company performs shipping and handling activities after the transfer of control to the customer (e.g., when control transfers prior to shipment), these are considered fulfillment activities, and accordingly, the costs are accrued when the related revenue is recognized. Taxes collected from customers relating to product sales and remitted to governmental authorities are excluded from revenues. The Company elected to use the practical expedient to expense cash and non-cash sales incentives, as the amortization period for the costs to obtain the contract would have been one year or less.\nCertain long-term contracts include a series of distinct goods that are delivered continuously to the customer through a pipeline (e.g., feedstocks). For these types of product sales, the Company invoices the customer in an amount that directly corresponds with the value to the customer of the Company’s performance to date. As a result, the Company recognizes revenue based on the amount billable to the customer in accordance with the right to invoice practical expedient.\n91\nThe transaction price includes estimates for reductions in revenue from customer rebates and right of returns on product sales. These amounts are estimated based upon the most likely amount of consideration to which the customer will be entitled. All estimates are based on historical experience, anticipated performance and the Company’s best judgment at the time to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of revenue recognized will not occur. All estimates for variable consideration are reassessed periodically. The Company elected the practical expedient to not adjust the amount of consideration for the effects of a significant financing component for all instances in which the period between payment and transfer of the goods will be one year or less.\nFor contracts with multiple performance obligations, the Company allocates the transaction price to each performance obligation based on the relative standalone selling price. The standalone selling price is the observable price which depicts the price as if sold to a similar customer in similar circumstances.\nPatents, Trademarks and Licenses\nThe Company enters into licensing arrangements in which it licenses certain rights of its patents and technology to customers. Revenue from the majority of the Company’s licenses for patents and technology is derived from sales-based royalties. The Company estimates the amount of sales-based royalties it expects to be entitled to based on historical sales to the customer. For the remaining revenue from licensing arrangements, payments are typically received from the Company's licensees based on billing schedules established in each contract. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied.\nRemaining Performance Obligations\nRemaining performance obligations represent the transaction price allocated to unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied performance obligations. At December 31, 2021, the Company had unfulfilled performance obligations of $\n829\nmillion ($\n977\nmillion at December 31, 2020) related to the licensing of technology and expects revenue to be recognized for the remaining performance obligations over the next six years.\nThe remaining performance obligations are for product sales that have expected durations of one year or less, product sales of materials delivered through a pipeline for which the Company has elected the right to invoice practical expedient, or variable consideration attributable to royalties for licenses of patents and technology. The Company has received advance payments from customers related to long-term supply agreements that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract, with remaining contract terms that range up to\n19\nyears. The Company will have rights to future consideration for revenue recognized when product is delivered to the customer. These payments are included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n92\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nDow disaggregates its revenue from contracts with customers by operating segment and business, as the Company believes it best depicts the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of its revenue and cash flows. See details in the tables below:\n1.\nEurope, Middle East, Africa and India.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nThe Company receives payments from customers based upon contractual billing schedules. Accounts receivable are recorded when the right to consideration becomes unconditional. Contract assets include amounts related to the Company’s contractual right to consideration for completed performance obligations not yet invoiced. Contract liabilities include payments received in advance of performance under the contract and are recognized in revenue when the performance obligations are met. \"Contract liabilities - current\" primarily reflects deferred revenue from prepayments from customers for product to be delivered in 12 months or less and royalty payments that are deferred and will be recognized in 12 months or less. \"Contract liabilities - noncurrent\" includes advance payments that the Company has received from customers related to long-term supply agreements and royalty payments that are deferred and recognized over the life of the contract.\nRevenue recognized in 2021 from amounts included in contract liabilities at the beginning of the period was approximately $\n295\nmillion (approximately $\n145\nmillion in 2020 and 2019). In 2021, the amount of contract assets reclassified to receivables as a result of the right to the transaction consideration becoming unconditional was approximately $\n35\nmillion (approximately $\n25\nmillion in 2020). The Company did not recognize any asset impairment charges related to contract assets in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n93\nThe following table summarizes the contract assets and liabilities at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n1.\nThe decrease from December 31, 2020 to December 31, 2021 was due to recognition of deferred royalty payments.\nNOTE 5 –\nDIVESTITURES\nDivestiture of Rail Infrastructure Operations and Assets\nOn September 30, 2020, TDCC\nsold its rail infrastructure operations and assets, including existing agreements to provide rail services to unrelated third parties, at six sites in the U.S. & Canada to an affiliate of Watco Companies, L.L.C. for cash proceeds of $\n303\nmillion, net of costs to sell and other adjustments and subject to customary post-closing adjustments. These assets are located at TDCC’s sites in Plaquemine and St. Charles, Louisiana; Freeport and Seadrift, Texas; and Fort Saskatchewan and Prentiss, Alberta, Canada. Divested operations included property with a net book value of $\n68\nmillion and goodwill of $\n2\nmillion ($\n16\nmillion related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics and $\n54\nmillion related to Corporate). TDCC retained ownership of the sites and underlying real property where the divested operations are located. TDCC and the buyer entered into mutual long-term service agreements designed to ensure the continuation of rail services for TDCC's existing operations at each site. The rail-service agreements include variable fees that have an initial term of 25 years. TDCC recognized a pretax gain of $\n233\nmillion on the sale ($\n48\nmillion related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics and $\n185\nmillion related to Corporate), included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company evaluated the divestiture of the rail infrastructure operations and assets and determined it did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results and did not qualify as an individually significant component of the Company. As a result, the divestiture is not reported as discontinued operations.\nDivestiture of Marine and Terminal Operations and Assets\nOn December 1, 2020, TDCC sold certain U.S. Gulf Coast marine and terminal operations and assets, including existing agreements to provide marine and terminal services to unrelated third parties, at three U.S. sites to an affiliate of Royal Vopak for cash proceeds of $\n600\nmillion, net of costs to sell and other adjustments and subject to customary post-closing adjustments. These assets are located at TDCC's sites in Plaquemine and St. Charles, Louisiana, and Freeport, Texas. Divested operations included property with a net book value of $\n93\nmillion and goodwill of $\n8\nmillion ($\n7\nmillion related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $\n17\nmillion related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and $\n77\nmillion related to Corporate). TDCC retained ownership of the sites and the underlying real property where the divested operations are located. TDCC and the buyer entered into mutual long-term service agreements designed to ensure the continuation of marine and terminal services for TDCC's existing operations at each site. The marine and terminal service agreements include fixed and variable fees that have initial terms of up to 25 years. In the fourth quarter of 2020, TDCC recognized a pretax gain of $\n499\nmillion on the sale ($\n17\nmillion related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics, $\n61\nmillion related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and $\n421\nmillion related to Corporate), included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income.\nThe Company evaluated the divestiture of the marine and terminal operations and assets and determined it did not represent a strategic shift that had a major effect on the Company’s operations and financial results and did not qualify as an individually significant component of the Company. As a result, the divestiture is not reported as discontinued operations.\n94\nNOTE 6 –\nRESTRUCTURING, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND ASSET RELATED CHARGES - NET\nThe \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" line in the consolidated statements of income is used to record charges for restructuring programs, goodwill impairments, and other asset related charges, which includes other asset impairments.\nRestructuring Programs\n2020 Restructuring Program\nOn September 29, 2020, the Board of Dow Inc. approved restructuring actions to achieve the Company's structural cost improvement initiatives in response to the continued economic impact from the coronavirus disease 2019 (\"COVID-19\") pandemic. The restructuring program was designed to reduce structural costs and enable the Company to further enhance competitiveness while the COVID-19 economic recovery gained traction. This program included a global workforce cost reduction of approximately\n6\npercent and actions to rationalize the Company's manufacturing assets, which included asset write-down and write-off charges, related contract termination fees and environmental remediation costs (\"2020 Restructuring Program\"). Severance benefits are provided to employees primarily under Dow's ongoing benefit arrangements and are accrued against the Corporate segment once management commits to a plan of termination. The actions related to the 2020 Restructuring Program were substantially complete by the end of 2021, except for certain cash payments expected to be made in 2022.\nIn the third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $\n575\nmillion, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $\n297\nmillion, asset write-downs and write-offs of $\n197\nmillion and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $\n81\nmillion. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company recorded net favorable pretax restructuring credits of $\n1\nmillion related to asset write-downs and write-offs and $\n1\nmillion related to costs associated with exit and disposal activities (related to Performance Materials & Coatings and Corporate). The adjustment to costs associated with exit and disposal activities included curtailment costs associated with a defined benefit pension plan. See Note 20 for additional information. In 2021, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $\n12\nmillion for asset write-downs and write-offs and $\n10\nmillion for costs associated with exit and disposal activities. In addition, the Company reduced pretax restructuring charges by $\n10\nmillion for severance and related benefit costs.\nThe following table summarizes the activities related to the 2020 Restructuring Program:\nAt December 31, 2021, $\n112\nmillion ($\n227\nmillion at December 31, 2020) of the reserve balance was included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and $\n56\nmillion ($\n137\nmillion at December 31, 2020) was included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n95\nThe Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $\n585\nmillion inception-to-date under the 2020 Restructuring Program, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $\n287\nmillion, asset write-downs and write-offs of $\n208\nmillion and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $\n90\nmillion.\nAsset Write-downs and Write-offs\nThe 2020 Restructuring Program included charges related to the write-down and write-off of assets totaling $\n196\nmillion in 2020. Details regarding the asset write-downs and write-offs are as follows:\n•\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics recorded a charge of $\n11\nmillion to rationalize its production capacity by shutting down a small-scale production unit.\n•\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure recorded a charge of $\n22\nmillion to rationalize its asset footprint by shutting down certain amines and solvents facilities in the United States and Europe as well as select, small-scale downstream polyurethanes manufacturing facilities.\n•\nPerformance Materials & Coatings recorded a charge of $\n116\nmillion to shut down manufacturing assets, primarily related to small-scale coatings reactors, and will also rationalize its upstream asset footprint in Europe and the U.S. & Canada by adjusting the supply of siloxane and silicon metal to balance to regional needs.\n•\nCorporate recorded a charge of $\n47\nmillion related to the write-down of leased, non-manufacturing facilities and the write-down of miscellaneous assets.\nThe 2020 Restructuring Program included charges related to the write-down and write-off of assets totaling $\n12\nmillion in 2021, which included additional write-down and write-off of assets related to the actions listed above, impacting Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n1\nmillion) and Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n8\nmillion), and the write-down of an additional non-manufacturing facility impacting Corporate ($\n3\nmillion).\nShut down related activities for impacted facilities were substantially complete by the end of 2021.\nCosts Associated with Exit and Disposal Activities\nThe 2020 Restructuring Program included charges of $\n80\nmillion for costs associated with exit and disposal activities in 2020, which included $\n19\nmillion for contract termination fees related to the asset actions listed above, impacting Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n9\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n10\nmillion), as well as $\n56\nmillion for environmental remediation, impacting Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n52\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n4\nmillion) and $\n5\nmillion related to curtailment costs associated with a defined benefit pension plan, impacting Corporate.\nThe 2020 Restructuring Program included charges of $\n10\nmillion for costs associated with exit and disposal activities in 2021, which included contract termination fees and environmental remediation, impacting Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n8\nmillion) and Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n2\nmillion).\nDowDuPont Cost Synergy Program\nIn September and November 2017, DowDuPont approved post-Merger restructuring actions under the DowDuPont Cost Synergy Program (the \"Synergy Program\") which was designed to integrate and optimize the organization following the Merger and in preparation for the business separations. The Company expected (prior to the impact of any discontinued operations) to record total pretax restructuring charges of approximately $\n1.3\nbillion, which included initial estimates of approximately $\n525\nmillion to $\n575\nmillion of severance and related benefit costs, $\n400\nmillion to $\n440\nmillion of asset write-downs and write-offs, and $\n290\nmillion to $\n310\nmillion of costs associated with exit and disposal activities. The restructuring charges below reflect charges from continuing operations.\nThe Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $\n292\nmillion in 2019, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $\n123\nmillion, assets write-downs and write-offs of $\n143\nmillion and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $\n26\nmillion.\nIn 2020, the Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $\n86\nmillion and reduced pretax restructuring charges by $\n6\nmillion in 2021, both for severance and related benefit costs. Cash expenditures related to the Synergy Program were substantially complete at December 31, 2020.\nAt December 31, 2021, $\n4\nmillion was included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" ($\n21\nmillion at December 31, 2020) and $\n10\nmillion ($\n13\nmillion at December 31, 2020) was included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n96\nThe Company recorded pretax restructuring charges of $\n955\nmillion inception-to-date under the Synergy Program on a continuing operations basis, consisting of severance and related benefit costs of $\n647\nmillion, asset write-downs and write-offs of $\n263\nmillion and costs associated with exit and disposal activities of $\n45\nmillion.\nAsset Write-downs and Write-offs\nThe restructuring charges related to the write-down and write-off of assets in 2019 under the Synergy Program were as follows:\n•\nThe Company recorded a charge of $\n143\nmillion for other miscellaneous asset write-downs and write-offs, including the shutdown of several small manufacturing facilities and the write-off of non-manufacturing assets and certain corporate facilities. The charge related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n2\nmillion), Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n28\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n113\nmillion). These manufacturing facilities were substantially shut down by the end of 2020.\nThere were no restructuring charges related to the write-down and write-off of assets in 2020 and 2021 under the Synergy Program.\nCosts Associated with Exit and Disposal Activities\nThe restructuring charges for costs associated with exit and disposal activities, including contract cancellation penalties and environmental remediation liabilities, totaled $\n26\nmillion in 2019 and\nzero\nin 2020 and 2021.\nThe Company expects to incur additional costs in the future related to its restructuring activities. Future costs are expected to include demolition costs related to closed facilities and restructuring implementation costs. These costs will be recognized as incurred. The Company also expects to incur additional employee-related costs, including involuntary termination benefits, related to its other optimization activities. These costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time.\n2019 Goodwill Impairment\nUpon completion of the goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined the fair value of the Coatings & Performance Monomers reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount. As a result, the Company recorded an impairment charge of $\n1,039\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2019, related to Performance Materials & Coatings. See Note 13 for additional information.\nAsset Related Charges\n2020 Charges\nIn 2020, the Company recognized pretax impairment charges of $\n49\nmillion, including additional pretax impairment charges for capital additions made to a bio-ethanol manufacturing facility in Santa Vitoria, Minas Gerais, Brazil (\"Santa Vitoria\"), which was impaired in 2017 and divested in 2020, as well as charges for miscellaneous write-offs and write-downs of non-manufacturing assets and the write-down of certain corporate leased equipment. The impairment charges related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n19\nmillion), Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n15\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n15\nmillion). See Note 23 for additional information.\n2019 Charges\nOn August 13, 2019, the Company entered into a definitive agreement to sell its acetone derivatives business to ALTIVIA Ketones & Additives, LLC. The transaction closed on November 1, 2019 and included the Company's acetone derivatives related inventory and production assets, located in Institute, West Virginia, in addition to the site infrastructure, land, utilities and certain railcars. The Company remains at the Institute site as a tenant. As a result of the planned transaction, the Company recognized a pretax impairment charge of $\n75\nmillion in the third quarter of 2019, related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n24\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n51\nmillion). See Note 23 for additional information.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, upon completion of an evaluation of its equity method investment in Sadara Chemical Company (\"Sadara\") for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company determined that its investment in Sadara was other-than-temporarily impaired and it was written down to zero. Additionally, as part of Dow's evaluation of Sadara, the Company reserved certain of its notes and accounts receivable with Sadara due to uncertainty on the timing of collection. As a result, the Company recorded a $\n1,755\nmillion charge, related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n370\nmillion), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n1,168\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n217\nmillion). See Notes 12 and 23 for additional information.\n97\nIn 2019, the Company recognized pretax impairment charges of $\n58\nmillion related primarily to capital additions at Santa Vitoria, and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n44\nmillion), Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n9\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n5\nmillion). See Note 23 for additional information.\nNOTE 7 –\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION\n1.\nSee Note 20 for additional information.\n2.\nSee Note 15 for additional information.\n3.\nSee Note 16 for additional information.\n4.\nSee Note 3 for additional information.\n5.\nThe year ended December 31, 2021 includes post-closing adjustments on a previous divestiture, related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. The year ended December 31, 2020 primarily relates to a loss on the divestiture of a bio-ethanol manufacturing facility in Brazil, related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. The year ended December 31, 2019 includes post-closing adjustments on previous divestitures, related to Corporate.\n6.\nSee Note 5 for additional information.\nAccrued and Other Current Liabilities\n“Accrued and other current liabilities” were $\n3,481\nmillion and $\n3,299\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n3,790\nmillion and $\n3,256\nmillion at December 31, 2020, for Dow Inc. and TDCC, respectively. Accrued payroll, which is a component of \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and includes liabilities related to payroll, performance-based compensation and severance, was $\n1,030\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n866\nmillion at December 31, 2020. No other components of \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" were more than 5 percent of total current liabilities.\nOther Investments\nThe Company has investments in company-owned life insurance policies (\"COLI\"), which are recorded at their cash surrender value as of each balance sheet date.\nThe Company has the ability to monetize its investment in its COLI policies as an additional source of liquidity. In the first quarter of 2021, the Company monetized $\n200\nmillion of its existing COLI policies' value. In the second quarter of 2021, the Company repaid the drawdown against the cash surrender value. The Company had no outstanding monetization of its existing COLI policies' surrender value at December 31, 2021. In the first nine months of 2020, the Company monetized $\n211\nmillion of its existing COLI policies' value. In the fourth quarter of 2020, the Company repaid all existing drawdowns against the cash surrender value, which resulted in no monetization of its existing COLI policies' value at December 31, 2020. The repayments were reflected in \"Purchases of investments\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\n98\nSupplemental Cash Flow Information\nThe following table shows cash paid for interest and income taxes for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nNOTE 8 –\nINCOME TAXES\nThe financial statements for Dow Inc. and TDCC are substantially similar, including the reporting of current and deferred tax expense (benefit), provision for income taxes on continuing operations, and deferred tax asset and liability balances. As a result, the following income tax discussion pertains to Dow Inc. only.\n1.\nThe 2019 amount includes approximately $\n1.4\nbillion of expense related to goodwill impairment and environmental matters. See Notes 13 and 16 for additional information.\n2.\nThe 2019 amount includes approximately $\n1.8\nbillion of expense for Sadara related charges. See Note 12 for additional information.\n99\n1.\nCertain prior year rates have been adjusted to conform with the current year presentation.\n2.\nThe 2020 impact relates to the divestiture of a bio-ethanol manufacturing facility in Brazil. See Note 6 for additional information.\n3.\nIncludes the impact of tax reform in Switzerland and the United States.\n4.\nThe 2021 impact represents a capital loss incurred on an internal restructuring fully offset by a valuation allowance reported in \"Changes in valuation allowances\" line item. The 2019 impact primarily relates to the favorable impact of the restoration of tax basis in assets, driven by a court judgment that did not involve the Company.\n5.\nSee Note 12 for additional information.\n6.\nSee Note 13 for additional information.\nThe Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) was enacted on March 27, 2020 in the United States. While the CARES Act had no significant impact on the Company's provision for income taxes on continuing operations in 2020, the Company filed a tax loss carryback claim for $\n291\nmillion in accordance with the provisions of the CARES Act in 2020. This resulted in an increase in \"Accounts and notes receivable - other\" and a decrease in \"Deferred income tax assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets. In 2021, the Company received $\n247\nmillion of the tax loss carryback claim with the residual balance expected to be received in 2022.\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, a valuation allowance of $\n260\nmillion was recorded in the United States, primarily due to filing of the final combined Dow and DuPont tax return and related unutilized foreign tax credits. In 2021, the Company's strong earnings and revised projections resulted in a reversal of the valuation allowance.\n1.\nCertain prior year balances have been adjusted to conform with the current year presentation.\n100\nUndistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries and related companies that are deemed to be permanently invested amounted to $\n7,769\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n7,401\nmillion at December 31, 2020. Undistributed earnings are subject to certain taxes upon repatriation, primarily where foreign withholding taxes apply. It is not practicable to calculate the unrecognized deferred tax liability on undistributed earnings.\nPrior to the separation, TDCC and its consolidated subsidiaries were included in DowDuPont's consolidated federal income tax group and consolidated tax return. Generally, the consolidated tax liability of the DowDuPont U.S. tax group for each year was apportioned among the members of the consolidated group based on each member’s separate taxable income. TDCC and DuPont intend that, to the extent federal and/or state corporate income tax liabilities are reduced through the utilization of tax attributes of the other, settlement of any receivable and payable generated from the use of the other party’s sub-group attributes will be in accordance with a tax sharing agreement and/or tax matters agreement. At December 31, 2021, the Company had a receivable of\nzero\nrelated to the tax sharing agreement ($\n261\nmillion at December 31, 2020), included in \"Other current assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets. Balances related to the tax matters agreement are further discussed in Note 3.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of the Company's unrecognized tax benefits:\nThe 2021 impacts primarily relate to an increase in uncertain tax positions due to controversy in multiple jurisdictions related to various prior year cross-border matters.\n101\nThe Company files tax returns in the multiple jurisdictions. These returns are subject to examination and possible challenge by the tax authorities. Open tax years are indicated in the table below.\nOpen years contain matters that could be subject to differing interpretations of applicable tax laws and regulations as they relate to the amount, character, timing or inclusion of revenue and expenses or the sustainability of income tax credits for a given audit cycle. The ultimate resolution of such uncertainties is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations.\nNOTE 9 -\nEARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS\nThe following tables provide earnings per share calculations of Dow Inc. for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. In accordance with the accounting guidance for earnings per share, earnings per share of TDCC is not presented as this information is not required in financial statements of wholly owned subsidiaries.\n102\n1.\nRestricted stock units are considered participating securities due to the Company's practice of paying dividend equivalents on unvested shares.\n2.\nThe year ended December 31, 2019 reflected a loss from continuing operations, and as such, the basic share count was used for purposes of calculating earnings per share on a diluted basis.\n3.\nThese outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock and restricted stock units were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect of including them would have been antidilutive.\nNOTE 10 –\nINVENTORIES\nThe following table provides a breakdown of inventories:\nInventories valued on the LIFO basis represented\n27\npercent\nof the total inventories at December 31, 2021 and\n30\npercent of the total inventories at December 31, 2020.\nNOTE 11 –\nPROPERTY\nThe following table provides a breakdown of property:\n103\nNOTE 12 –\nNONCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES\nThe Company’s investments in companies accounted for using the equity method (“nonconsolidated affiliates”), by classification in the consolidated balance sheets, and dividends received from nonconsolidated affiliates are shown in the following tables:\n1.\nThe carrying amount of the Company’s investments in nonconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n55\nmillion less than its share of the investees’ net assets, exclusive of additional differences relating to Sadara, EQUATE Petrochemical Company K.S.C.C. (\"EQUATE\") and AgroFresh Solutions Inc. (\"AFSI\"), which are discussed separately in the disclosures that follow.\n1.\nIncluded in \"Earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates less than (in excess of) dividends received\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nExcept for AFSI, the nonconsolidated affiliates in which the Company has investments are privately held companies; therefore, quoted market prices are not available.\nSadara\nIn 2011, the Company and Saudi Arabian Oil Company formed Sadara - a joint venture between the two companies that subsequently constructed and now operates a world-scale, fully integrated chemicals complex in Jubail Industrial City, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The Company has a\n35\npercent equity interest in this joint venture and has been, and continues to be, responsible for marketing the majority of Sadara’s products through the Company’s established sales channels. In 2021, Dow and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company agreed to and began transitioning the marketing rights and responsibilities for Sadara’s finished products to levels more consistent with each partner’s equity ownership.\nThe Company’s investment in Sadara was $\n1,541\nmillion less than Dow’s proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets held by Sadara at December 31, 2021 ($\n1,618\nmillion less at December 31, 2020). This basis difference is primarily attributed to the long-lived assets of Sadara and is being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the assets. At December 31, 2021, the Company had an investment balance in Sadara of $\n416\nmillion included in “Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates” (negative $\n22\nmillion at December 31, 2020 included in “Other noncurrent obligations”) in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets. See Note 16 for additional information related to guarantees.\nIn 2019, the Company recorded impairment charges related to its investment in Sadara. The joint venture achieved full commercial operations of all its facilities in 2017. In December 2018, the joint venture successfully completed its Creditors Reliability Test, an extensive operational testing program designed to demonstrate the reliability of the joint venture’s full chemical complex by operating at high rates for an extended period of time. While Sadara had reached these operational milestones and had been generating positive EBITDA (a non-GAAP measure defined as earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization), the joint venture had yet to report positive net income. During the fourth quarter of 2019, Sadara tested its long-lived assets for impairment using long-term cash flow projections. Sadara’s U.S. GAAP impairment test utilized an undiscounted cash flow methodology, under which Sadara concluded its long-lived assets were recoverable. Due to Sadara's financial condition and its long-lived asset impairment test, Dow evaluated its equity method investment in Sadara for other-than-temporary impairment. The Company utilized a discounted cash flow methodology to measure the estimated fair value of its investment in Sadara, which was estimated to be zero (see Note 23 for additional information on the fair value measurement). The Company determined the decline in value of its investment in Sadara was other-than-temporary due to Sadara’s financial performance since becoming commercially operational in 2017 and uncertainty around prospects for recovery in Sadara’s financial condition. In addition, the Company reserved certain accounts and notes receivable and accrued interest balances associated with Sadara due to uncertainty around the timing of collection. In total, the Company recorded a $\n1,755\nmillion pretax charge in the fourth quarter of 2019 related to Sadara, included in “Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net” in the consolidated statements of\n104\nincome and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n370\nmillion), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n1,168\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n217\nmillion).\nIn 2020, the Company loaned $\n333\nmillion to Sadara that was accounted for as in substance common stock and classified as \"Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the Company's consolidated balance sheets. The Company loaned $\n473\nmillion to Sadara and converted $\n380\nmillion of the notes and accounts receivable into equity during 2019. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company's note receivable with Sadara was\nzero\n.\nEQUATE\nAt December 31, 2021, the Company had an investment balance in EQUATE of $\n115\nmillion included in “Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates” (negative $\n147\nmillion at December 31, 2020 included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\") in the consolidated balance sheets. The Company's investment in EQUATE was $\n458\nmillion less than the Company's proportionate share of EQUATE's underlying net assets at December 31, 2021 ($\n475\nmillion less at December 31, 2020), which represents the difference between the fair values of certain MEGlobal assets acquired by EQUATE and the Company's related valuation on a U.S. GAAP basis. A basis difference of $\n140\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n155\nmillion at December 31, 2020) is being amortized over the remaining useful lives of the assets and the remainder is considered a permanent difference.\nAFSI\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company had an investment balance in AFSI of\nzero\n. At December 31, 2021, the Company's investment in AFSI was $\n96\nmillion less than the Company's proportionate share of AFSI's underlying net assets ($\n108\nmillion less at December 31, 2020). This amount primarily relates to an other-than-temporary decline in the Company's investment in AFSI. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, the Company held a\n40\npercent ownership interest in AFSI.\nTransactions with Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company has service agreements with certain nonconsolidated affiliates, including contracts to manage the operations of manufacturing sites and the construction of new facilities; licensing and technology agreements; and marketing, sales, purchase, lease and sublease agreements.\nThe Company sells excess ethylene glycol produced at manufacturing facilities in the United States and Europe to MEGlobal, a subsidiary of EQUATE. The Company also sells ethylene to MEGlobal as a raw material for its ethylene glycol plants in Canada. Sales of these products to MEGlobal represented\n1\npercent of total net sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019. Sales of ethylene to MEGlobal are reflected in the Packaging & Specialty Plastics segment and represented\n2\npercent of the segment's sales in 2021 (\n2\npercent in 2020 and\n1\npercent in 2019). Sales of ethylene glycol to MEGlobal are reflected in the Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure segment and represented\n1\npercent of the segment's sales in 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe Company is responsible for marketing the majority of Sadara products outside of the Middle East zone through the Company’s established sales channels. Under this arrangement, the Company purchases and sells Sadara products for a marketing fee. In March 2021, Dow and the Saudi Arabian Oil Company agreed to transition the marketing rights and responsibilities for Sadara’s finished products to levels more consistent with each partner’s equity ownership. This transition began in July 2021 and is being implemented over the next five years. Purchases of Sadara products represented\n9\npercent of \"Cost of sales\" in 2021 (\n8\npercent in 2020 and 2019).\nThe Company purchases products from The SCG-Dow Group, primarily for marketing and distribution in Asia Pacific. Purchases of products from The SCG-Dow Group represented\n3\npercent of \"Cost of sales\" in 2021 (\n3\npercent in 2020 and\n2\npercent in 2019).\nSales to and purchases from other nonconsolidated affiliates were not material to the consolidated financial statements.\nBalances due to or due from nonconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n105\nPrincipal Nonconsolidated Affiliates\nThe Company had an ownership interest in\n37\nnonconsolidated affiliates at December 31, 2021 (\n35\nat December 31, 2020).\nThe Company's principal nonconsolidated affiliates and its ownership interest (direct and indirect) for each at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\n1.\nThe Company's effective ownership of Map Ta Phut Olefins Company Limited (\"Map Ta Phut\") is\n32.77\npercent, of which the Company directly owns\n20.27\npercent and indirectly owns\n12.5\npercent through its equity interest in Siam Polyethylene Company Limited.\nThe Company’s investment in and equity earnings from its principal nonconsolidated affiliates are as follows:\nThe summarized financial information that follows represents the combined accounts (at\n100\npercent) of the principal nonconsolidated affiliates.\n1.\nThe results in this table include purchase and sale activity between certain principal nonconsolidated affiliates and the Company, as previously discussed in the \"Transactions with Nonconsolidated Affiliates\" section.\n106\nNOTE 13 –\nGOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table shows changes in the carrying amounts of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe separation from DowDuPont did not impact the composition of the Company's six reporting units: Coatings & Performance Monomers, Consumer Solutions, Hydrocarbons & Energy, Industrial Solutions, Packaging and Specialty Plastics and Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals. The ECP businesses received as part of the separation from DowDuPont are included in the Hydrocarbons & Energy and Packaging and Specialty Plastics reporting units. At December 31, 2021, goodwill was carried by all reporting units except Coatings & Performance Monomers (“C&PM”).\nGoodwill Impairments\nThe carrying amounts of goodwill at December 31, 2021 and 2020 were net of accumulated impairments of $\n309\nmillion in Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and $\n2,530\nmillion in Performance Materials & Coatings.\nGoodwill Impairment Testing\nThe Company performs an impairment test of goodwill annually in the fourth quarter. In 2021, the Company performed qualitative testing for all reporting units that carried goodwill. Based on the results of the qualitative testing, the Company did\nnot\nperform quantitative testing on any reporting units (\none\nin 2020 and\ntwo\nin 2019). The qualitative testing on the reporting units indicated that it was not more likely than not that fair value was less than the carrying value for the reporting units.\nThe quantitative testing conducted in 2020 concluded that no goodwill impairments existed.\nUpon completion of the quantitative testing in the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company determined the C&PM reporting unit was impaired. During 2019, the C&PM reporting unit did not consistently meet expected financial performance targets, primarily due to the industry’s increased captive use of coatings products, which led to volume reductions; reduced margins for products across the portfolio due to changes in customer buying patterns and supply and demand balances; as well as a continuous trend of customer consolidation in end-markets, which reduced growth opportunities. As a result, the C&PM reporting unit lowered its future revenue and profitability projections. The fair value of the C&PM reporting unit was determined using a discounted cash flow methodology that reflected reductions in projected revenue growth rates due to lower sales volume and price assumptions, as well as reductions to future growth rates. These discounted cash flows did not support the carrying value of the C&PM reporting unit. As a result, the Company recorded a goodwill impairment charge of $\n1,039\nmillion in the fourth quarter of 2019, included in “Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to the Performance Materials & Coatings segment. The carrying value of the C&PM reporting unit's goodwill was\nzero\nat December 31, 2019. No other goodwill impairments were identified as a result of the 2019 testing.\n107\nOther Intangible Assets\nThe following table provides information regarding the Company’s other intangible assets:\nThe following table provides information regarding amortization expense from continuing operations related to intangible assets:\nTotal estimated amortization expense from continuing operations for the next five fiscal years, including amounts expected to be capitalized, is as follows:\nNOTE 14 –\nTRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS\nAccounts Receivable Programs\nThe Company maintains committed accounts receivable facilities with various financial institutions, including in the United States, which expires in November 2022 (“U.S. A/R Program”) and in Europe, which expires in July 2023 (“Europe A/R Program” and together with the U.S. A/R Program, \"the Programs\").

Significant other restrictive covenants and default provisions related to these agreements include:\n(a)  the obligation to maintain the ratio of TDCC’s consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization at no greater than\n0.70\nto 1.00 at any time the aggregate outstanding amount of loans under the Five Year Competitive Advance and Revolving Credit Facility Agreement (\"Revolving Credit Agreement\") dated November 23, 2021, equals or exceeds $\n500\nmillion,\n(b)    a default if TDCC or an applicable subsidiary fails to make any payment, including principal, premium or interest, under the applicable agreement on other indebtedness of, or guaranteed by, TDCC or such applicable subsidiary in an aggregate amount of $\n100\nmillion or more when due, or any other default or other event under the applicable agreement with respect to such indebtedness occurs which permits or results in the acceleration of $\n400\nmillion or more in the aggregate of principal, and\n(c)    a default if TDCC or any applicable subsidiary fails to discharge or stay within 60 days after the entry of a final judgment against TDCC or such applicable subsidiary of more than $\n400\nmillion.\nFailure of TDCC to comply with any of the covenants or default provisions could result in a default under the applicable credit agreement which would allow the lenders to not fund future loan requests and to accelerate the due date of the outstanding principal and accrued interest on any outstanding indebtedness.\nOn April 1, 2019, DowDuPont completed the separation of its materials science business and Dow Inc. became the direct parent company of TDCC. In conjunction with the separation, Dow Inc. is obligated, substantially concurrently with the issuance of any guarantee in respect of outstanding or committed indebtedness under TDCC's Revolving Credit Agreement, to enter into a supplemental indenture with TDCC and the trustee under TDCC’s existing 2008 base indenture governing certain notes issued by TDCC. Under such supplemental indenture, Dow Inc. will guarantee all outstanding debt securities and all amounts due under such existing base indenture and will become subject to certain covenants and events of default under the existing base indenture.\nIn addition, the Revolving Credit Agreement includes an event of default which would be triggered in the event Dow Inc. incurs or guarantees third party indebtedness for borrowed money in excess of $\n250\nmillion or engages in any material activity or directly owns any material assets, in each case, subject to certain conditions and exceptions. Dow Inc. may, at its option, cure the event of default by delivering an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee to the administrative agent within thirty days of the event or events giving rise to such event of default.\nNo such events have occurred or have been triggered at the time of the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nNOTE 16 –\nCOMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\nEnvironmental Matters\nIntroduction\nAccruals for environmental matters are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated based on current law and existing technologies. At December 31, 2021, the Company had accrued obligations of $\n1,220\nmillion for probable environmental remediation and restoration costs ($\n1,244\nmillion at December 31, 2020), including $\n237\nmillion for the remediation of Superfund sites ($\n248\nmillion at December 31, 2020). This is management’s best estimate of the costs for remediation and restoration with respect to environmental matters for which the Company has accrued liabilities, although it is reasonably possible that the ultimate cost with respect to these particular matters could range up to approximately two times that amount. Consequently, it is reasonably possible that environmental remediation and restoration costs in excess of amounts accrued could have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition and cash flows. It is the opinion of the Company’s management, however, that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of the range disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows. Inherent uncertainties exist in these estimates primarily due to unknown conditions, changing governmental regulations and legal standards regarding liability, and emerging remediation technologies for handling site remediation and restoration. As new or additional information becomes available and/or certain spending trends become known, management will evaluate such information in determination of the current estimate of the environmental liability.\n112\nAs part of the Company's 2020 Restructuring Program, in the third quarter of 2020, the Company recorded a pretax charge related to environmental remediation matters. This charge resulted from the Company's evaluation of the costs required to manage remediation activities at sites Dow will permanently shut down as part of its 2020 Restructuring Program. In addition, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $\n50\nmillion related to Dow Silicones' environmental matters. The Company recognized a pretax charge, net of indemnifications, of $\n56\nmillion, included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n52\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n4\nmillion). See Note 6 for additional information.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a pretax charge related to environmental remediation matters at a number of current and historical locations. The charge primarily resulted from: the culmination of long-standing negotiations and discussions with regulators and agencies, including technical studies supporting higher cost estimates for final or staged remediation plans; the Company’s evaluation of the cost required to manage remediation activities at sites affected by Dow’s separation from DowDuPont and related agreements with Corteva and DuPont; and, the Company’s review of its closure strategies and obligations to monitor ongoing operations and maintenance activities. In addition, the Company recorded indemnification assets of $\n48\nmillion related to Dow Silicones’ environmental matters. The Company recognized a pretax charge, net of indemnifications, of $\n399\nmillion related to these environmental matters, included in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n5\nmillion), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n8\nmillion), Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n50\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n336\nmillion).\nThe following table summarizes the activity in the Company's accrued obligations for environmental matters for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe amounts charged to income on a pretax basis related to environmental remediation totaled $\n158\nmillion in 2021, $\n234\nmillion in 2020 and $\n588\nmillion in 2019. Capital expenditures for environmental protection were $\n65\nmillion in 2021, $\n80\nmillion in 2020 and $\n83\nmillion in 2019.\nMidland Off-Site Environmental Matters\nOn June 12, 2003, the Michigan Department of Environmental Quality (\"MDEQ\") issued a Hazardous Waste Operating License (the \"License\") to the Company’s Midland, Michigan, manufacturing site (the “Midland Site”), which was renewed and replaced by the MDEQ on September 25, 2015, and included provisions requiring the Company to conduct an investigation to determine the nature and extent of off-site contamination in the City of Midland soils, the Tittabawassee River and Saginaw River sediment and floodplain soils, and the Saginaw Bay, and, if necessary, undertake remedial action. In 2016, final regulatory approval was received from the MDEQ for the City of Midland and the Company is continuing the long term monitoring requirements of the Remedial Action Plan.\nTittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers, Saginaw Bay\nThe Company, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) and the State of Michigan (\"State\") entered into an administrative order on consent (“AOC”), effective January 21, 2010, that requires the Company to conduct a remedial investigation, a feasibility study and a remedial design for the Tittabawassee River, the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay, and pay the oversight costs of the EPA and the State under the authority of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act. These actions, to be conducted under the lead oversight of the EPA, will build upon the investigative work completed under the State Resource Conservation Recovery Act program from 2005 through 2009.\n113\nThe Tittabawassee River, beginning at the Midland Site and extending down to the first six miles of the Saginaw River, are designated as the first Operable Unit for purposes of conducting the remedial investigation, feasibility study and remedial design work. This work will be performed in a largely upriver to downriver sequence for eight geographic segments of the Tittabawassee and upper Saginaw Rivers. In the first quarter of 2012, the EPA requested the Company address the Tittabawassee River floodplain (\"Floodplain\") as an additional segment. In January 2015, the Company and the EPA entered into an order to address remediation of the Floodplain. The remedial work is expected to continue over the next two years as river levels allow. The remainder of the Saginaw River and the Saginaw Bay are designated as a second Operable Unit and the work associated with that unit may also be geographically segmented. The AOC does not obligate the Company to perform removal or remedial action; that action can only be required by a separate order. The Company and the EPA have been negotiating orders separate from the AOC that obligate the Company to perform remedial actions under the scope of work of the AOC. The Company and the EPA have entered into six separate orders to perform limited remedial actions in seven of the eight geographic segments in the first Operable Unit, including the Floodplain. Dow has received from the EPA a Notice of Completion of Work for three of these six orders and the Company continues the long-term monitoring requirements. Dow also has entered into a separate order to perform a limited remedial action for certain properties located within the second Operable Unit.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution Process\nThe Company, the EPA, the U.S. Department of Justice and the natural resource damage trustees (which include the Michigan Office of the Attorney General, the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy, the Michigan Department of Natural Resources, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs and the Saginaw-Chippewa Indian Tribe of Michigan) have been engaged in negotiations to seek to resolve potential governmental claims against the Company for natural resource damages related to historical off-site contamination associated with the City of Midland, the Tittabawassee and Saginaw Rivers and the Saginaw Bay. The Company and the governmental parties started meeting in the fall of 2005 and entered into a Confidentiality Agreement in December 2005.\nOn July 20, 2020, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (\"District Court\") entered a final consent decree in Civil Action No. 1:19-cv-13292 between the Company and federal, state and tribal trustees to resolve allegations of natural resource damages arising from the historic operations of the Company’s Midland Site. The consent decree required the Company to pay a $\n15\nmillion cash settlement to be used for long-term maintenance and trustee-selected remediation projects with an additional $\n7\nmillion to specified local projects managed by third parties. These funds were paid in December 2020. The consent decree further requires the Company to complete 13 additional environmental restoration projects which are valued by the trustees at approximately $\n77\nmillion, to be conducted over the next several years. In 2021, the Company, working with the trustees, advanced the design plans for several of the Company required environmental restoration projects with implementation in progress for one of the projects.\nAt December 31, 2021, the accrual for these off-site matters was $\n104\nmillion (included in the total accrued obligation of $\n1,220\nmillion). At December 31, 2020, the Company had an accrual for these off-site matters of $\n107\nmillion (included in the total accrued obligation of $\n1,244\nmillion).\nEnvironmental Matters Summary\nIt is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that costs in excess of those disclosed will have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations, financial condition or cash flows.\nLitigation\nAsbestos-Related Matters of Union Carbide Corporation\nIntroduction\nUnion Carbide is and has been involved in a large number of asbestos-related suits filed primarily in state courts during the past four decades. These suits principally allege personal injury resulting from exposure to asbestos-containing products and frequently seek both actual and punitive damages. The alleged claims primarily relate to products that Union Carbide sold in the past, alleged exposure to asbestos-containing products located on Union Carbide’s premises and Union Carbide’s responsibility for asbestos suits filed against a former Union Carbide subsidiary, Amchem Products, Inc. (\"Amchem\"). In many cases, plaintiffs are unable to demonstrate that they have suffered any compensable loss as a result of such exposure, or that injuries incurred in fact resulted from exposure to Union Carbide’s products. Union Carbide expects more asbestos-related suits to be filed against Union Carbide and Amchem in the future, and will aggressively defend or reasonably resolve, as appropriate, both pending and future claims.\n114\nEstimating the Asbestos-Related Liability\nBased on a study completed by Ankura Consulting Group, LLC (\"Ankura\") in January 2003, Union Carbide increased its December 31, 2002, asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims for a 15-year period ending in 2017 to $\n2.2\nbillion, excluding future defense and processing costs. In subsequent years, Union Carbide compared current asbestos claim and resolution activity to the results of the most recent Ankura study at each balance sheet date to determine whether the accrual continued to be appropriate.\nIn 2016, Ankura completed a study to provide estimates for the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem through the terminal year of 2049, including a reasonable forecast of future defense and processing costs. Based on the study and Union Carbide’s internal review of asbestos claim and resolution activity, Union Carbide determined estimating the liability through the terminal year of 2049 was more appropriate due to increased knowledge and data about the costs to resolve claims and diminished volatility in filing rates. Union Carbide and the Company also determined that estimating and accruing a liability for future asbestos-related defense and processing costs was more appropriate as such costs represent expenditures related to legacy activities that do not contribute to current or future revenue generating activities of Union Carbide and the Company and is also reflective of the manner in which Union Carbide manages its asbestos-related exposure, including careful monitoring of the correlation between defense spending and resolution costs. As a result, in the fourth quarter of 2016, Union Carbide recorded a $\n1,113\nmillion increase in its asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims, including future defense and processing costs. Each October, Union Carbide requests Ankura to review its historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through the third quarter of the current year, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, to determine the appropriateness of updating the most recent study.\nIn December 2019, Ankura stated that an update of its December 2018 study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in the study and, therefore, the estimate in the study remained applicable. Based on Union Carbide's internal review process and Ankura's response, Union Carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required.\nIn December 2020, Ankura completed a study of Union Carbide's historical asbestos claim and resolution activity through September 30, 2020, including asbestos-related defense and processing costs, and provided estimates for the undiscounted cost of disposing of pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem through the terminal year of 2049. Based on the study and Union Carbide's internal review process, it was determined that no adjustment to the accrual was required. At December 31, 2020, the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem, including future asbestos-related defense and processing costs, was $\n1,098\nmillion, and approximately\n22\npercent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately\n78\npercent related to future claims.\nIn December 2021, Ankura stated that an update of its December 2020 study would not provide a more likely estimate of future events than the estimate reflected in the study and, therefore, the estimate in the study remained applicable. Based on Union Carbide's internal review process and Ankura's response, Union Carbide determined that no change to the accrual was required. At December 31, 2021, the asbestos-related liability for pending and future claims against Union Carbide and Amchem, including future asbestos-related defense and processing costs, was $\n1,016\nmillion, and approximately\n25\npercent of the recorded liability related to pending claims and approximately\n75\npercent related to future claims.\nSummary\nThe Company's management believes the amounts recorded by Union Carbide for the asbestos-related liability, including defense and processing costs, reflect reasonable and probable estimates of the liability based upon current, known facts. However, future events, such as the number of new claims to be filed and/or received each year, the average cost of defending and disposing of each such claim, as well as the numerous uncertainties surrounding asbestos litigation in the United States over a significant period of time, could cause the actual costs for Union Carbide to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded. Any such events could result in an increase or decrease in the recorded liability.\nBecause of the uncertainties described above, Union Carbide cannot estimate the full range of the cost of resolving pending and future asbestos-related claims facing Union Carbide and Amchem. As a result, it is reasonably possible that an additional cost of disposing of Union Carbide's asbestos-related claims, including future defense and processing costs, could have a material impact on the Company's results of operations and cash flows for a particular period and on the consolidated financial position.\n115\nDow Silicones Chapter 11 Related Matters\nIntroduction\nIn 1995, Dow Silicones, then a 50:50 joint venture between the Company and Corning Incorporated (\"Corning\"), voluntarily filed for protection under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in order to resolve Dow Silicones’ breast implant liabilities and related matters (the “Chapter 11 Proceeding”). Dow Silicones emerged from the Chapter 11 Proceeding on June 1, 2004 (the “Effective Date”) and is implementing the Joint Plan of Reorganization (the “Plan”). The Plan provides funding for the resolution of breast implant and other product liability litigation covered by the Chapter 11 Proceeding. As of June 1, 2016, Dow Silicones is a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company.\nBreast Implant and Other Product Liability Claims\nUnder the Plan, a product liability settlement program administered by an independent claims office (the “Settlement Facility”) was created to resolve breast implant and other product liability claims. Product liability claimants rejecting the settlement program in favor of pursuing litigation must bring suit against a litigation facility (the “Litigation Facility”). Under the Plan, total payments committed by Dow Silicones to resolving product liability claims are capped at a maximum $\n2,350\nmillion net present value (“NPV”) determined as of the Effective Date using a discount rate of\n7\npercent (approximately $\n4,081\nmillion undiscounted at December 31, 2021). Of this amount, no more than $\n400\nmillion NPV determined as of the Effective Date can be used to fund the Litigation Facility.\nDow Silicones had an obligation to fund the Settlement Facility and the Litigation Facility over a 16-year period, commencing at the Effective Date. At December 31, 2021, Dow Silicones and its insurers have made life-to-date payments of $\n1,792\nmillion to the Settlement Facility and Dow Silicones is currently making payments to fund the Settlement Facility.\nIn accordance with ASC Topic 450 \"Accounting for Contingencies,\" the Company records a liability for breast implant and other product liability claims (“Implant Liability”), which reflects the estimated impact of the settlement of pending claims. The claim filing deadline passed in June 2019. All claims have been received and are being processed. Based on the claims filed at and before the deadline, Dow Silicones estimates that it will be obligated to contribute an additional $\n130\nmillion to the Settlement Facility at December 31, 2021 ($\n160\nmillion at December 31, 2020) which was included in “Accrued and other current liabilities” and \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nIn the third quarter of 2019, with the assistance of a third party consultant (\"Consultant\"), Dow Silicones updated its Implant Liability estimate, primarily reflecting a decrease in Class 16 claims, a decrease resulting from the passage of time, decreased claim filing activity and administrative costs compared with the previous estimate, and an increase in investment income resulting from insurance proceeds. Based on the Consultant's updated estimate and Dow Silicones own review of claim filing activity, Dow Silicones determined that an adjustment to the Implant Liability was required. Accordingly, in the third quarter of 2019, Dow Silicones decreased its Implant Liability $\n98\nmillion and decreased its corresponding Class 16 receivable $\n13\nmillion, both included in “Sundry income (expense) - net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Corporate. The estimate was updated again in the second quarter of 2020 with the assistance of the Consultant, which primarily reflected decreased administrative costs compared with the previous estimate and an increase in investment income resulting from insurance proceeds.\nDow Silicones is not aware of circumstances that would change the factors used in estimating the Implant Liability and believes the recorded liability reflects the best estimate of the remaining funding obligations under the Plan; however, the estimate relies upon a number of significant assumptions, including: future acceptance rates, disease mix, and payment values will be materially consistent with historical experience; no material negative outcomes in future controversies or disputes over Plan interpretation will occur; and the Plan will not be modified. If actual outcomes related to any of these assumptions prove to be materially different, the future liability to fund the Plan may be materially different than the amount estimated.\n116\nCommercial Creditor Issues\nThe Plan provides that each of Dow Silicones commercial creditors (the “Commercial Creditors”) would receive in cash the sum of (a) an amount equal to the principal amount of their claims and (b) interest on such claims. Upon the Plan becoming effective, Dow Silicones paid approximately $\n1,500\nmillion to the Commercial Creditors, representing principal and an amount of interest that Dow Silicones considers undisputed. On August 19, 2019, Dow Silicones entered into a settlement agreement with the Commercial Creditors related to the remaining disputed portion, obligating Dow Silicones to pay $\n172\nmillion, inclusive of the Commercial Creditors' legal costs. The settlement was approved by the District Court. As a result of the settlement agreement, in the third quarter of 2019, the Company recorded a pretax charge of $\n50\nmillion, net of indemnifications of $\n37\nmillion, included in \"Sundry Income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Corporate. The settlement was paid to the Commercial Creditors in the fourth quarter of 2019. The litigation is now concluded.\nSummary\nThe amounts recorded by Dow Silicones for the Chapter 11 related matters described above were based upon current, known facts, which management believes reflect reasonable and probable estimates of the liability. However, future events could cause the actual costs for Dow Silicones to be higher or lower than those projected or those recorded. Any such events could result in an increase or decrease in the recorded liability.\nOther Litigation Matters\nIn addition to the specific matters described above, the Company is party to a number of other claims and lawsuits arising out of the normal course of business with respect to product liability, patent infringement, employment matters, governmental tax and regulation disputes, contract and commercial litigation, and other actions. Certain of these actions purport to be class actions and seek damages in very large amounts. All such claims are being contested. The Company has an active risk management program consisting of numerous insurance policies secured from many carriers at various times. These policies may provide coverage that could be utilized to minimize the financial impact, if any, of certain contingencies described above. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that the aggregate of all such other claims and lawsuits will have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and cash flows of the Company.\nIndemnifications with Corning\nIn connection with the June 1, 2016 ownership restructure of Dow Silicones, the Company is indemnified by Corning for at least\n50\npercent of future losses associated with certain pre-closing liabilities, including the Implant Liability, Commercial Creditors issues and certain environmental matters described in the preceding sections, subject to certain conditions and limits. The maximum amount of indemnified losses which may be recovered are subject to a cap that declines over time. Indemnified losses are capped at $\n1\nbillion between May 31, 2018 and May 31, 2023, and\nno\nrecoveries are permitted after May 31, 2023. The Company had indemnification assets of $\n95\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n115\nmillion at December 31, 2020), which was included in \"Other current assets\" and \"Noncurrent receivables\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nGain Contingency - Dow v. Nova Chemicals Corporation Patent Infringement Matter\nIn December 2010, Dow filed suit in the Federal Court in Ontario, Canada (\"Federal Court\") alleging that Nova Chemicals Corporation (\"Nova\") was infringing the Company's Canadian polyethylene patent 2,106,705 (the \"'705 Patent\"). Nova counterclaimed on the grounds of invalidity and non-infringement. In accordance with Canadian practice, the suit was bifurcated into a merits phase, followed by a damages phase. Following trial in the merits phase, in May 2014 the Federal Court ruled that the Company's '705 Patent was valid and infringed by Nova. Nova appealed to the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal, which affirmed the Federal Court decision in August 2016. Nova then sought leave to appeal its loss to the Supreme Court of Canada (\"Court\"), which dismissed Nova’s petition in April 2017. As a result, Nova has exhausted all appeal rights on the merits, and it is undisputed that Nova owes the Company the profits it earned from its infringing sales as determined in the trial for the damages phase.\nIn April 2017, the Federal Court issued a Public Judgment in the damages phase, which detailed its conclusions on how to calculate the profits to be awarded to the Company. In June 2017, the Federal Court ordered Nova to pay $\n645\nmillion Canadian dollars (equivalent to $\n495\nmillion U.S. dollars) to the Company, plus pre- and post-judgment interest, for which the Company received payment of $\n501\nmillion from Nova in July 2017. Although Nova is appealing portions of the damages judgment, certain portions of it are indisputable and can be retained by the Company regardless of the outcome of any further appeals by Nova. As a result of these actions and in accordance with ASC Topic 450-30 \"Gain Contingencies,\" the Company recorded a $\n160\nmillion pretax gain in the second quarter of 2017.\n117\nOn September 15, 2020, the Canadian Federal Court of Appeal dismissed Nova's appeal of the damages judgment, thus affirming the trial court's decision in its entirety. In November 2020, Nova filed an application for leave to appeal this decision to the Court. In May 2021, the Court granted Nova's application for leave and agreed to review the damages judgment. The Court will hear oral argument on the matter in the first half of 2022 and the Company expects a decision by the end of 2022. The Company is confident of its chances to continue to defend the entire judgment, particularly the trial and appellate courts' determinations on important factual issues, which will be accorded deferential review on appeal. At December 31, 2021, the Company had $\n341\nmillion ($\n341\nmillion at December 31, 2020) included in \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" related to the disputed portion of the damages judgment.\nGain Contingency - Dow v. Nova Chemicals Corporation Ethylene Asset Matter\nOn September 18, 2019, the Court of the Queen’s Bench in Alberta, Canada, signed a judgment ordering Nova to pay the Company $\n1.43\nbillion Canadian dollars (equivalent to approximately $\n1.08\nbillion U.S. dollars) by October 11, 2019, for damages the Company incurred through 2012 related to the companies’ jointly-owned ethylene asset in Joffre, Alberta, Canada. The Court of the Queen's Bench in Alberta, Canada, which initially ruled in June 2018, found that Nova failed to operate the ethylene asset at full capacity for more than ten years, and furthermore, that Nova violated several contractual agreements related to the Company receiving its share of the asset’s ethylene production. These actions resulted in reduced productivity and sales for the Company. Nova has appealed the judgment, however, certain portions of it are not in dispute and are owed to the Company regardless of the outcome of Nova's appeal. As a result of these actions and in accordance with ASC Topic 450-30 “Gain Contingencies,” the Company recorded a $\n186\nmillion pretax gain in the third quarter of 2019, of which $\n170\nmillion was included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" and $\n16\nmillion was included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. In October 2019, Nova paid $\n1.08\nbillion Canadian dollars (equivalent to approximately $\n0.8\nbillion U.S. dollars) directly to the Company, and remitted $\n347\nmillion Canadian dollars to the Canada Revenue Agency (\"CRA\") for the tax account of one of the Company's subsidiaries. The Company sought a refund of the entire amount remitted to CRA.\nOn March 31, 2020, the Company received the full refund from CRA, equivalent to $\n259\nmillion U.S. dollars.\nIn preparation for the June 2020 appellate hearing on the case, Nova provided the Court\nof the Queen's Bench in Alberta, Canada,\nan updated schedule of the financial impact of the issues on appeal, which explained that even if Nova prevails on all appeal issues, the Company would still be entitled to retain an amount in excess of the gain recognized in 2019. As a result, the Company recorded an $\n18\nmillion pretax gain in the second quarter of 2020, of which $\n12\nmillion was included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" and $\n6\nmillion was include\nd in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. On September 16, 2020, the Court of Appeal of Alberta issued its decision, affirming the trial court's liability finding, upholding the majority of Dow's damages and requiring the trial court to recalculate a portion of damages. In the fourth quarter of 2020, Nova chose not to petition the Court to review the appellate court decision, making additional portions of the ruling in Dow’s favor final and no longer subject to dispute. As a result, the Company recorded a $\n552\nmillion pretax gain in the fourth quarter of 2020, of which $\n538\nmillion was included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" and $\n14\nmillion was included in \"Selling, general and administrative expenses\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. At December 31, 2021, $\n323\nmillion ($\n323\nmillion at December 31, 2020) was included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the Company's consolidated balance sheets related to the disputed portion of the damages judgment. Dow continues to seek an award of additional damages for the period from 2013 through 2018. The damages hearing began in the trial court in November 2021 that would resolve the impact of the appellate ruling and quantify Dow's damages for the 2013-2018 period.\nLuxi Chemical Group Breach of Contract Matter\nIn November 2017, an arbitration panel of the Stockholm Chamber of Commerce held that Luxi Chemical Group Co., Ltd. (“Luxi”), based in Shandong Province, China, violated a secrecy and non-use agreement related to the Dow and Johnson Matthey Davy Technologies Limited (“JM”) LP Oxo\nSM\nProcess by using Dow and JM protected information in the design, construction, and operation of its butanol and 2-ethylhexanol plants, awarding damages, fees and costs, plus interest, to both Dow and JM. In September 2021, Luxi paid the arbitration award and interest assessment and, as a result, Dow recorded a pretax gain of $\n54\nmillion included in “Sundry income (expense) – net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure.\n118\nBrazilian Tax Credits\nIn March 2017, the Federal Supreme Court of Brazil (“Brazil Supreme Court”) ruled in a leading case that a Brazilian value-added tax (\"ICMS\") should not be included in the base used to calculate a taxpayer's federal contribution on total revenue known as PIS/COFINS (the “2017 Decision”). Previously, three of the Company’s Brazilian subsidiaries filed lawsuits challenging the inclusion of ICMS in their calculation of PIS/COFINS, seeking recovery of excess taxes paid. In response to the 2017 Decision, the Brazilian tax authority filed an appeal seeking clarification of the amount of ICMS tax to exclude from the calculation of PIS/COFINS. In May 2021, the Brazil Supreme Court ruled in a leading case related to the amount of ICMS tax to exclude from the calculation of PIS/COFINS, which resolved two of the lawsuits filed by the Company. As a result, in 2021, the Company recorded a pretax gain of $\n67\nmillion for certain excess PIS/COFINS paid from 2009 to 2019, plus applicable interest, which the Company expects to apply to future required federal tax payments, and the reversal of related liabilities. The pretax gain was recorded in “Cost of sales” in the consolidated statements of income. At December 31, 2021, related tax credits available and expected to be applied to future required federal tax payments totaled $\n52\nmillion. The Company has not received a final ruling related to its remaining lawsuit.\nPurchase Commitments\nThe Company has outstanding purchase commitments and various commitments for take-or-pay or throughput agreements. The Company was not aware of any purchase commitments that were negotiated as part of a financing arrangement for the facilities that will provide the contracted goods or services or for the costs related to those goods or services at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nGuarantees\nThe following table provides a summary of the final expiration, maximum future payments and recorded liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for guarantees:\n1.\nIn addition, TDCC has provided guarantees, in proportion to the Company's 35 percent ownership interest, of all future interest payments that will become due on Sadara’s project financing debt during the grace period, which Dow's share is estimated to be $\n446\nmillion at December 31, 2021. Based on Sadara's current forecasted cash flows, the Company does not expect to be required to perform under the guarantees.\nGuarantees arise during the ordinary course of business from relationships with customers, committed accounts receivable facilities and nonconsolidated affiliates when the Company undertakes an obligation to guarantee the performance of others (via delivery of cash or other assets) if specified triggering events occur. With guarantees, such as commercial or financial contracts, non-performance by the guaranteed party triggers the obligation of the Company to make payments to the beneficiary of the guarantee. The majority of the Company’s guarantees relate to debt of nonconsolidated affiliates, which have expiration dates ranging from less than one year to less than 17 years. The Company’s current expectation is that future payment or performance related to the non-performance of others is considered remote.\nTDCC has entered into guarantee agreements related to Sadara, a nonconsolidated affiliate. The total of an Islamic bond and additional project financing (collectively “Total Project Financing”) obtained by Sadara was approximately $\n12.5\nbillion, of which $\n9.6\nbillion of Total Project Financing debt was outstanding at December 31, 2021 ($\n9.9\nbillion at December 31, 2020). In November 2020, the remaining project completion conditions related to the Total Project Financing guarantees were fulfilled and the Company's guarantee obligations terminated. Subsequently, the Company provided a new guarantee in the form of a letter of credit for its share of one future debt service schedule payment up to $\n220\nmillion. The guarantee was in proportion to the Company’s\n35\npercent ownership interest in Sadara and was in effect until Sadara reached an agreement with its lenders to re-profile its outstanding project financing debt in the first quarter of 2021, at which time it was cancelled. In conjunction with the completion of Sadara's debt re-profiling, TDCC entered into a new guarantee of up to approximately $\n1.3\nbillion of Sadara’s debt, proportionate to the Company's\n35\npercent ownership interest. The debt re-profiling includes a grace period until June 2026, during which Sadara is obligated to make interest-only payments which are guaranteed by TDCC in proportion to the Company's\n35\npercent ownership interest. In addition, as part of the debt re-profiling, Sadara established a new $\n500\nmillion revolving credit facility guaranteed by Dow, which will be used to fund Dow’s pro-rata share of any potential shortfall during the grace period. Based on Sadara's current forecasted cash flows,\n119\nthe Company does not expect Sadara to draw on the facility. As a result of these actions, TDCC does not expect to provide any shareholder loans or equity contributions to Sadara in 2022. See Note 12 for additional information.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe Company has\n104\nmanufacturing sites in\n31\ncountries. Most of these sites contain numerous individual manufacturing operations, particularly at the Company’s larger sites. Asset retirement obligations are recorded as incurred and reasonably estimable, including obligations for which the timing and/or method of settlement are conditional on a future event that may or may not be within the control of the Company. The retirement of assets may involve such efforts as remediation and treatment of asbestos, contractually required demolition, and other related activities, depending on the nature and location of the assets; and retirement obligations are typically realized only upon demolition of those facilities. In identifying asset retirement obligations, the Company considers identification of legally enforceable obligations, changes in existing law, estimates of potential settlement dates and the calculation of an appropriate discount rate to be used in calculating the fair value of the obligations. The Company has a well-established global process to identify, approve and track the demolition of retired or to-be-retired facilities; and no assets are retired from service until this process has been followed. The Company typically forecasts demolition projects based on the usefulness of the assets; environmental, health and safety concerns; and other similar considerations. Under this process, as demolition projects are identified and approved, reasonable estimates are determined for the time frames during which any related asset retirement obligations are expected to be settled. For those assets where a range of potential settlement dates may be reasonably estimated, obligations are recorded. The Company routinely reviews all changes to items under consideration for demolition to determine if an adjustment to the value of the asset retirement obligation is required.\nThe Company has recognized asset retirement obligations for the following activities: demolition and remediation activities at manufacturing sites primarily in Europe, Canada, United States, Japan, United Arab Emirates and Brazil; and capping activities at landfill sites in the United States, Brazil and Canada. The Company has also recognized conditional asset retirement obligations related to asbestos encapsulation as a result of planned demolition and remediation activities at manufacturing and administrative sites primarily in the United States, Europe, Japan and Argentina. The aggregate carrying amount of conditional asset retirement obligations recognized by the Company (included in the asset retirement obligations balance shown below) was $\n13\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n14\nmillion at December 31, 2020).\nThe following table shows changes in the aggregate carrying amount of the Company’s asset retirement obligations for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nThe discount rate used to calculate the Company’s asset retirement obligations at December 31, 2021, was\n1.13\npercent (\n0.42\npercent at December 31, 2020). These obligations are included in the consolidated balance sheets as \"Accrued and other current liabilities\" and \"Other noncurrent obligations.\"\n120\nThe Company has not recognized conditional asset retirement obligations for which a fair value cannot be reasonably estimated in its consolidated financial statements. Assets that have not been submitted/reviewed for potential demolition activities are considered to have continued usefulness and are generally still operating normally. Therefore, without a plan to demolish the assets or the expectation of a plan, such as shortening the useful life of assets for depreciation purposes in accordance with the accounting guidance related to property, plant and equipment, the Company is unable to reasonably forecast a time frame to use for present value calculations. As such, the Company has not recognized obligations for individual plants/buildings at its manufacturing sites where estimates of potential settlement dates cannot be reasonably made. In addition, the Company has not recognized conditional asset retirement obligations for the capping of its approximately\n36\nunderground storage wells and\n128\nunderground brine mining and other wells at Company-owned sites when there are no plans or expectations of plans to exit the sites. It is the opinion of the Company’s management that the possibility is remote that such conditional asset retirement obligations, when estimable, will have a material impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements based on current costs.\nNOTE 17 -\nLEASES\nOperating lease ROU assets are included in \"Operating lease right-of-use assets\" while finance lease ROU assets are included in \"Net property\" in the consolidated balance sheets. With respect to lease liabilities, operating lease liabilities are included in \"Operating lease liabilities - current\" and \"Operating lease liabilities - noncurrent,\" and finance lease liabilities are included in \"Long-term debt due within one year\" and \"Long-Term Debt\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\nDow routinely leases sales and administrative offices, power plants, production facilities, warehouses and tanks for product storage, aircraft, motor vehicles, railcars, computers, office machines and equipment. Some leases contain renewal provisions, purchase options and escalation clauses and the terms for these leased assets vary depending on the lease agreement. These leased assets have remaining lease terms of up to\n54\nyears. See Note 1 for additional information on leases.\nThe components of lease cost for operating and finance leases for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n121\nThe following table provides supplemental cash flow and other information related to leases:\n1.\nIn 2021, $\n193\nmillion of leased assets were reclassified from Operating leases to Finance leases due to an amendment that extended the term of the agreement.\n2.\n2019 includes $\n2.3\nbillion related to the adoption of Topic 842. See Note 1 for additional information.\nThe following table summarizes the lease-related assets and liabilities recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nIn 2021, the Company executed buy-outs of certain leased assets for $\n687\nmillion. The lease buy-outs reduced “Operating lease right-of-use assets” by $\n166\nmillion and reduced “Operating lease liabilities - current” and “Operating lease liabilities - noncurrent” by $\n44\nmillion and $\n158\nmillion, respectively. The Company recognized a pretax loss related to the lease buy-outs of $\n37\nmillion included in “Sundry income (expense) - net” in the consolidated statements of income. The lease buy-outs are included in “Purchases of previously leased assets” in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nAdditionally, in 2021, the Company amended an agreement to extend leases of certain assets. The amendment and related remeasurement resulted in a reclassification of $\n73\nmillion from “Operating lease liabilities – noncurrent” to “Long-Term Debt” and $\n34\nmillion from “Operating lease liabilities - current” to “Long-term debt due within one year.\" In addition to the reclassifications, the amendment increased “Long-Term Debt” by $\n152\nmillion and decreased “Long-term debt due within one year\" by $\n2\nmillion.\n122\nThe weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate for leases recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are provided below:\nThe following table provides the maturities of lease liabilities at December 31, 2021:\nAt December 31, 2021, Dow had additional leases of approximately $\n113\nmillion, primarily for equipment, which had not yet commenced. These leases are expected to commence in 2022 and 2025, with lease terms of up to\n16\nyears.\nDow provides guarantees related to certain leased assets, specifying the residual value that will be available to the lessor at lease termination through the sale of the assets to the lessee or third parties. The following table provides a summary of the final expiration, maximum future payments and recorded liability reflected in the consolidated balance sheets for residual value guarantees at December 31, 2021 and 2020. The lease agreements do not contain any material restrictive covenants.\nNOTE 18 –\nSTOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY\nCommon Stock\nDow Inc.\nDow Inc. was incorporated in 2018 with\n100\nauthorized and issued shares of common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, owned solely by its parent company, DowDuPont. In the first quarter of 2019, in connection with the separation and distribution of DowDuPont’s materials science business, the number of authorized shares of common stock was increased to\n5,000,000,000\nshares, par value $\n0.01\nper share, and Dow Inc.'s\n100\nshares of issued common stock were recapitalized into\n748,771,240\nshares of common stock. Dow Inc.'s common stock was solely owned by DowDuPont through March 31, 2019, and on April 1, 2019, Dow Inc. became an independent, publicly traded company. Dow Inc. common stock is listed on the NYSE under the symbol “DOW.” See Note 3 for additional information.\n123\nThe Company may issue shares of Dow Inc. common stock out of treasury stock or as new shares of common stock for options exercised and for the release of restricted stock units (\"RSUs\"), performance stock units (\"PSUs\") and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan (\"ESPP\") program. Common stock shares issued to employees and non-employee directors was approximately\n8.2\nmillion in 2021 (\n4.8\nmillion in 2020). Subsequent to the separation from DowDuPont, the number of new Dow Inc. common stock shares issued to employees and non-employee directors was approximately\n2.5\nmillion in 2019. See Note 21 for additional information on the Company's equity awards.\nTDCC\nEffective with the Merger and through March 31, 2019, TDCC had\n100\nauthorized and issued shares of common stock, par value $\n0.01\nper share, owned solely by DowDuPont. Effective with the separation from DowDuPont, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc., which now holds all\n100\nauthorized and issued shares of common stock of TDCC. See Note 3 for additional information.\nRetained Earnings\nDow Inc.\nThere are no significant restrictions limiting Dow Inc.’s ability to pay dividends. Dow Inc. declared dividends of $\n2.80\nper share in 2021 ($\n2.80\nper share in 2020 and $\n2.10\nper share in 2019, subsequent to the separation from DowDuPont).\nUndistributed earnings of nonconsolidated affiliates included in retained earnings were $\n1,155\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n716\nmillion at December 31, 2020.\nTDCC\nEffective with the Merger, TDCC no longer had publicly traded common stock. TDCC's common shares were owned solely by DowDuPont, prior to the separation on April 1, 2019, and TDCC's Board determined whether or not there would be a dividend distribution to DowDuPont. Effective with the separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. and TDCC's Board determines whether or not there will be a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. TDCC declared and paid dividends to Dow Inc. of $\n3,264\nmillion in 2021, $\n2,233\nmillion in 2020 and $\n201\nmillion in 2019. In 2019, TDCC declared and paid dividends to DowDuPont of $\n535\nmillion.\nEmployee Stock Ownership Plan\nThe Dow Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the “ESOP”) is an integral part of The Dow Chemical Company Employees’ Savings Plan (the “Savings Plan”). A significant majority of full-time employees in the United States are eligible to participate in the Savings Plan. The Company uses the ESOP to provide its matching contribution in the form of stock to Plan participants. Effective with the Merger, shares of TDCC Common Stock held by the ESOP were converted into shares of DowDuPont Common Stock at a ratio of 1:1. Effective with the separation from DowDuPont, the DowDuPont Common Stock held by the ESOP received a Dow Inc. Common Stock share dividend at a ratio of 3:1, resulting in the ESOP holding both DowDuPont and Dow Inc. shares. Subsequent to the separation from DowDuPont, the ESOP independent fiduciary sold the DowDuPont shares and purchased additional Dow Inc. shares with the proceeds.\nIn connection with the acquisition of Rohm and Haas on April 1, 2009, the Rohm and Haas Employee Stock Ownership Plan (the \"Rohm and Haas ESOP\") was merged into the Savings Plan, and the Company assumed the $\n78\nmillion balance of debt at\n9.8\npercent interest with final maturity in 2020 that was used to finance share purchases by the Rohm and Haas ESOP in 1990. The debt was fully repaid in 2020 which resulted in an outstanding balance of\nzero\nat December 31, 2020.\nDividends on unallocated shares held by the ESOP are used by the ESOP to make debt service payments and to purchase additional shares if dividends exceed the debt service payments. Dividends on allocated shares are used by the ESOP to make debt service payments to the extent needed; otherwise, they are paid to the Savings Plan participants. Shares are released for allocation to participants based on the ratio of the current year’s debt service to the sum of the principal and interest payments over the life of the loan. The shares are allocated to Plan participants in accordance with the terms of the Savings Plan. The unallocated shares are excluded from the Company's earnings per share calculation.\n124\nCompensation expense for allocated shares is recorded at the fair value of the shares on the date of allocation. Compensation expense reflected in income from continuing operations for ESOP shares was $\n77\nmillion in 2021, $\n72\nmillion in 2020 and $\n77\nmillion in 2019. At December 31, 2021,\n4.0\nmillion shares out of a total\n4.5\nmillion shares held by the ESOP had been allocated to participants’ accounts and\n0.5\nmillion shares, at a fair value of $\n29\nmillion, were considered unearned.\nTreasury Stock\nDow Inc.\nOn April 1, 2019, Dow Inc.'s Board ratified the share repurchase program originally approved on March 15, 2019, authorizing up to $\n3.0\nbillion to be spent on the repurchase of the Company's common stock, with no expiration date. In 2021, Dow Inc. repurchased $\n1.0\nbillion of Dow Inc. common stock ($\n125\nmillion in 2020 and $\n500\nmillion in 2019). At December 31, 2021, $\n1.4\nbillion of the share repurchase program authorization remained available for repurchases.\nThe Company may issue shares of Dow Inc. common stock out of treasury stock or as new shares of common stock for options exercised and for the release of RSUs, PSUs and ESPP. The Company did not issue any treasury shares to employees and non-employee directors under its stock-based compensation programs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. See Note 21 for additional information on changes to the Company's equity awards in connection with the separation from DowDuPont.\nThe following table provides a reconciliation of Dow Inc. common stock activity for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n1.\nShares issued to employees and non-employee directors under the Company's equity compensation plans.\n125\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Loss\nThe changes in each component of AOCL for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows:\n1.\nReclassified to \"Net sales\" and \"Sundry income (expense) - net.\"\n2.\nReclassified to \"Provision for income taxes on continuing operations.\"\n3.\nReclassified to \"Sundry income (expense) - net.\"\n4.\nReclassified to \"Retained earnings\" as a result of the separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019. See Note 3 for additional information.\n5.\nThese AOCL components are included in the computation of net periodic benefit cost of the Company's defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit plans. See Note 20 for additional information.\n6.\nReclassified to \"Cost of sales,\" \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" and \"Interest expense and amortization of debt discount.\"\n126\nNOTE 19 –\nNONCONTROLLING INTERESTS\nOwnership interests in the Company's subsidiaries held by parties other than the Company are presented separately from the Company's equity in the consolidated balance sheets as \"Noncontrolling interests.\" The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the Company and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the consolidated statements of income.\nThe following table summarizes the activity for equity attributable to noncontrolling interests for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n1.\nDistributions to noncontrolling interests are net of $\n7\nmillion in 2021 ($\n7\nmillion in 2020 and 2019) in dividends paid to a joint venture, which were reclassified to \"Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the consolidated statements of income. Also includes amounts attributable to discontinued operations of $\n7\nmillion in 2019.\n2.\nRelated to the separation from DowDuPont. See Note 3 for additional information.\n3.\nRelated to the acquisition of full ownership in a propylene oxide manufacturing joint venture, which occurred on October 1, 2019. See Note 24 for additional information. As a result of this arrangement, the carrying value of the noncontrolling interest was removed, and “Additional paid-in capital” was adjusted by $\n38\nmillion.\n4.\nRelated to the divestiture of the Company's interest in a cogeneration facility in Brazil in the third quarter of 2020.\n127\nNOTE 20 –\nPENSION PLANS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS\nDefined Benefit Pension Plans\nThe Company has both funded and unfunded defined benefit pension plans that cover employees in the United States and a number of other countries. The U.S. tax-qualified plan covering the parent company is the largest plan. Benefits for employees hired before January 1, 2008, are based on length of service and the employee’s three highest consecutive years of compensation. Employees hired after January 1, 2008, earn benefits that are based on a set percentage of annual pay, plus interest.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Company announced changes to its U.S. tax-qualified and non-qualified pension plans. Effective December 31, 2023 (\"Effective Date\"), the Company will freeze the pensionable compensation and credited service amounts used to calculate pension benefits for employees who participate in its U.S. tax-qualified and non-qualified retirement programs (collectively, the \"U.S. Plans\"). As a result, at the Effective Date and subject to any bargaining obligations required by law, active participants of the U.S. Plans will not accrue additional benefits for future service and compensation. In connection with these plan amendments, the Company remeasured its U.S. Plans effective February 28, 2021, which resulted in a pretax actuarial gain of $\n1,268\nmillion, included in other comprehensive income and inclusive of a $\n345\nmillion reduction in the projected benefit obligation resulting from the plan amendments, and a pretax curtailment gain of $\n19\nmillion, recognized in the first quarter of 2021.\nThe Company's funding policy is to contribute to the plans when pension laws and/or economics either require or encourage funding. On March 4, 2021, the Company elected to contribute $\n1\nbillion to its U.S. tax-qualified pension plans. Total global pension contributions were $\n1,219\nmillion in 2021, which includes contributions necessary to fund benefit payments for the Company's unfunded pension plans. The Company expects to contribute approximately $\n180\nmillion to its pension plans in 2022.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit costs for all plans are summarized in the table below:\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine pension plan obligations and net periodic benefit costs for U.S. plans are summarized in the table below:\n128\nOther Postretirement Benefit Plans\nThe Company provides certain health care and life insurance benefits to retired employees and survivors. The Company’s plans outside of the United States are not significant; therefore, this discussion relates to the U.S. plans only. The plans provide health care benefits, including hospital, physicians’ services, drug and major medical expense coverage, and life insurance benefits. In general, for employees hired before January 1, 1993, the plans provide benefits supplemental to Medicare when retirees are eligible for these benefits. The Company and the retiree share the cost of these benefits, with the Company portion increasing as the retiree has increased years of credited service, although there is a cap on the Company portion. The Company has the ability to change these benefits at any time. Employees hired after January 1, 2008, are not covered under the plans.\nThe Company funds most of the cost of these health care and life insurance benefits as incurred. In 2021, the Company did not make any contributions to its other postretirement benefit plan trusts. The trusts did not hold assets at December 31, 2021. The Company does not expect to contribute assets to its other postretirement benefit plan trusts in 2022.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to determine other postretirement benefit plan obligations and net periodic benefit costs for the U.S. plans are provided below:\nAssumptions\nThe Company determines the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by performing a detailed analysis of key economic and market factors driving historical returns for each asset class and formulating a projected return based on factors in the current environment. Factors considered include, but are not limited to, inflation, real economic growth, interest rate yield, interest rate spreads and other valuation measures and market metrics. The expected long-term rate of return for each asset class is then weighted based on the strategic asset allocation approved by the governing body for each plan. The Company’s historical experience with the pension fund asset performance is also considered.\nThe Company uses the spot rate approach to determine the discount rate utilized to measure the service cost and interest cost components of net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit costs for the U.S. and other selected countries. Under the spot rate approach, the Company calculates service cost and interest cost by applying individual spot rates from the Willis Towers Watson RATE:Link yield curve (based on high-quality corporate bond yields) for each selected country to the separate expected cash flow components of service cost and interest cost. Service cost and interest cost for all other plans are determined on the basis of the single equivalent discount rates derived in determining those plan obligations.\nThe discount rates utilized to measure the pension and other postretirement obligations of the U.S. plans are based on the yield on high-quality corporate fixed income investments at the measurement date. Future expected actuarially determined cash flows for the Company’s U.S. plans are individually discounted at the spot rates under the Willis Towers Watson U.S. RATE:Link 60-90 corporate yield curve (based on 60th to 90th percentile high-quality corporate bond yields) to arrive at the plan’s obligations as of the measurement date.\nThe Company’s mortality assumption used for the US plans is a benefit-weighted version of the Society of Actuaries’ RP-2014 base table with future rates of mortality improvement based on a modified version of the assumptions used in the Social Security Administration’s 2021 trustees report.\n129\nSummarized information on the Company's pension and other postretirement benefit plans is as follows:\n1.\nThe 2020 impact relates primarily to the transfer of benefit obligations in the U.S. through the purchase of annuity contracts from an insurance company.\n2.\nThe 2021 impact primarily relates to the freeze of pensionable compensation and credited service amounts for employees that participate in the U.S. Plans. The 2020 impact relates to pension plan curtailments of a European plan resulting from the 2020 Restructuring Program and the settlement of certain plan obligations of a U.S. non-qualified pension plan resulting from lump-sum payments.\n3.\nThe 2020 impact relates to the purchase of annuity contracts associated with the transfer of benefit obligations to an insurance company.\n130\nA significant component of the overall decrease in the Company's benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2021 was due to the change in weighted-average discount rates, which increased from\n2.20\npercent at December 31, 2020 to\n2.57\npercent at December 31, 2021. A significant component of the overall increase in the Company's benefit obligation for the year ended December 31, 2020 was due to the change in weighted-average discount rates, which decreased from\n2.81\npercent at December 31, 2019 to\n2.20\npercent at December 31, 2020.\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for all significant pension plans was $\n32.5\nbillion and $\n34.1\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\n1.\nThe 2021 impact primarily relates to the freeze of pensionable compensation and credited service amounts for employees that participate in the U.S. Plans. The 2020 impact relates to pension plan curtailments of a European plan resulting from the 2020 Restructuring Program and the settlement of certain plan obligations of a U.S. non-qualified pension plan resulting from lump-sum payments. The 2019 impact relates to plan curtailments and associated special termination benefits resulting from the reduction in plan participation due to the separation from DowDuPont.\n2.\nThe 2019 impact is the result of the Company's separation from DowDuPont.\n131\nExcept for plan curtailment costs related to the 2020 Restructuring Program, which are included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income, non-service cost components of net periodic benefit cost are included in \"Sundry income (expense) - net\" in the consolidated statements of income. See Notes 6 and 7 for additional information.\nEstimated Future Benefit Payments\nThe estimated future benefit payments of continuing operations, reflecting expected future service, as appropriate, are presented in the following table:\nPlan Assets\nPlan assets consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities of U.S. and foreign issuers, and include alternative investments, such as real estate, private equity and absolute return strategies. Plan assets totaled $\n28.2\nbillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n26.4\nbillion at December 31, 2020 and included no directly held common stock of Dow Inc.\nThe Company's investment strategy for plan assets is to manage the assets in relation to the liability in order to pay retirement benefits to plan participants over the life of the plans. This is accomplished by identifying and managing the exposure to various market risks, diversifying investments across various asset classes and earning an acceptable long-term rate of return consistent with an acceptable amount of risk, while considering the liquidity needs of the plans.\nThe plans are permitted to use derivative instruments for investment purposes, as well as for hedging the underlying asset and liability exposure and rebalancing the asset allocation. The plans use value-at-risk, stress testing, scenario analysis and Monte Carlo simulations to monitor and manage both the risk within the portfolios and the surplus risk of the plans.\nEquity securities primarily include investments in large- and small-cap companies located in both developed and emerging markets around the world. Fixed income securities include investment and non-investment grade corporate bonds of companies diversified across industries, U.S. treasuries, non-U.S. developed market securities, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, emerging market securities and fixed income related funds. Alternative investments primarily include investments in real estate, private equity and absolute return strategies. Other significant investment types include various insurance contracts and interest rate, equity, commodity and foreign exchange derivative investments and hedges.\nThe Company mitigates the credit risk of investments by establishing guidelines with investment managers that limit investment in any single issue or issuer to an amount that is not material to the portfolio being managed. These guidelines are monitored for compliance both by the Company and external managers. Credit risk related to derivative activity is mitigated by utilizing multiple counterparties, collateral support agreements and centralized clearing, where appropriate. A short-term investment money market fund is utilized as the sweep vehicle for the U.S. plans, which from time to time can represent a significant investment.\n132\nThe weighted-average target allocation for plan assets of the Company's pension plans is summarized as follows:\nFair value calculations may not be indicative of net realizable value or reflective of future fair values. Furthermore, although the Company believes its valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different fair value measurement at the reporting date.\nFor pension plan assets classified as Level 1 measurements (measured using quoted prices in active markets), total fair value is either the price of the most recent trade at the time of the market close or the official close price, as defined by the exchange on which the asset is most actively traded on the last trading day of the period, multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs.\nFor pension plan assets classified as Level 2 measurements, where the security is frequently traded in less active markets, fair value is based on the closing price at the end of the period; where the security is less frequently traded, fair value is based on the price a dealer would pay for the security or similar securities, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability. Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance and quality checks. For derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, swap rates, interest rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. For other pension plan assets for which observable inputs are used, fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models.\nFor pension plan assets classified as Level 3 measurements, total fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity for the investment.\nCertain pension plan assets are held in funds where fair value is based on an estimated net asset value per share (or its equivalent) as of the most recently available fund financial statements which are received on a monthly or quarterly basis. These valuations are reviewed for reasonableness based on applicable sector, benchmark and company performance. Adjustments to valuations are made where appropriate to arrive at an estimated net asset value per share at the measurement date. These funds are not classified within the fair value hierarchy.\n133\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure the Company’s pension plan assets at fair value for the years ended\nDecember 31, 2021 and 2020:\n1.\nNo Dow Inc. common stock was directly held at December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\n2.\nPrimarily receivables for investment securities sold.\n3.\nPrimarily payables for investment securities purchased.\n134\nThe following table summarizes the changes in the fair value of Level 3 pension plan assets for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020:\nDefined Contribution Plans\nU.S. employees may participate in defined contribution plans by contributing a portion of their compensation, which is partially matched by the Company. Defined contribution plans also cover employees in some subsidiaries in other countries, including China, Brazil, The Netherlands, Canada, Korea, Spain and the United Kingdom. Expense of continuing operations recognized for all defined contribution plans was $\n165\nmillion in 2021, $\n156\nmillion in 2020 and $\n163\nmillion in 2019.\nOn March 4, 2021, the Company announced changes to its U.S. tax-qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans. Effective January 1, 2022, contributions to U.S. tax-qualified and non-qualified defined contribution plans will be harmonized across the Company's U.S. eligible employee population. The new matching contribution will allow all eligible U.S. employees to receive matching contributions of up to\n5\npercent of their eligible compensation. In addition, beginning on January 1, 2024, all eligible U.S. employees will receive an automatic non-elective contribution of\n4\npercent of eligible compensation to their respective defined contribution plans.\nNOTE 21 –\nSTOCK-BASED COMPENSATION\nThe Company provides stock-based compensation in the form of the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which grants eligible employees the right to purchase shares of the Company's common stock at a discounted price. The Company also grants stock-based compensation to employees and non-employee directors under stock incentive plans, in the form of stock options, stock appreciation rights, PSUs and RSUs.\nIn connection with the Merger, on August 31, 2017 (\"Conversion Date\"), all outstanding TDCC stock options and RSU awards were converted into stock options and RSU awards with respect to DowDuPont common stock. The stock options and RSU awards had the same terms and conditions under the applicable plans and award agreements prior to the Merger. All outstanding and nonvested PSU awards were converted into RSU awards with respect to DowDuPont common stock at the greater of the applicable performance target or the actual performance as of the effective time of the Merger. Changes in the fair value of liability instruments are recognized as compensation expense each quarter. TDCC and Historical DuPont did not merge their stock-based compensation plans as a result of the Merger. TDCC and Historical DuPont stock-based compensation plans were assumed by DowDuPont and continued in place with the ability to grant and issue DowDuPont common stock until separation.\n135\nIn connection with the separation on April 1, 2019, outstanding stock options, RSU and PSU awards were converted to Dow Inc. denominated awards under the “Employer Method,” or DowDuPont denominated awards under the “Shareholder Method,” and adjusted to maintain the intrinsic value of those awards before and after the date of the separation. In connection with the Corteva separation transaction on June 3, 2019, the outstanding DowDuPont denominated stock options, RSU and PSU awards were converted to Corteva and DuPont denominated awards and adjusted to maintain the intrinsic value of those awards before and after the date of the Corteva separation. The awards have the same terms and conditions under the applicable plans and award agreements prior to the separation transactions.\nThe conversions of stock awards resulted in\nno\nincremental compensation expense. Approximately\n5,000\nemployees were impacted by the conversion on April 1, 2019 in connection with Dow Inc.'s separation from DowDuPont. Approximately\n4,000\nemployees were impacted by the conversion on June 3, 2019 in connection with the Corteva separation transaction.\nThe total stock-based compensation expense included in continuing operations in the consolidated statements of income was $\n276\nmillion, $\n171\nmillion and $\n158\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. The income tax benefits related to stock-based compensation arrangements were $\n62\nmillion, $\n39\nmillion and $\n36\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Amounts disclosed throughout the remainder of this footnote are inclusive of activity attributable to both continuing operations and discontinued operations, as the impact of discontinued operations is not significant.\nAccounting for Stock-Based Compensation\nThe Company grants stock-based compensation awards that vest over a specified period or upon employees meeting certain performance and/or retirement eligibility criteria. The fair value of equity instruments issued to employees is measured on the grant date. The fair value of liability instruments (granted to executive employees subject to stock ownership requirements, that provide the recipient the option to elect to receive a cash payment equal to the value of the stock award on the date of delivery) is measured at the end of each quarter. The fair value of equity and liability instruments is expensed over the vesting period or, in the case of retirement, from the grant date to the date on which retirement eligibility provisions have been met and additional service is no longer required. The Company estimates expected forfeitures based on historical activity.\nThe Company uses the Black-Scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used to calculate total stock-based compensation are included in the following table:\nThe dividend yield assumption was equal to the dividend yield on the grant date, which reflected the Company's quarterly dividend payments of $\n0.70\nper share in 2021, 2020 and 2019 on Dow Inc. Common Stock. The expected volatility assumptions for the 2021, 2020 and 2019 stock options were based on an equal weighting of the historical daily volatility for the expected term of the awards and current implied volatility from exchange-traded options. The expected volatility assumption for the market portion of the 2021, 2020 and 2019 PSU awards were based on historical daily volatility for the term of the award. The risk-free interest rate was based on the U.S. Treasury strip rates over the expected life of the 2021, 2020 and 2019 options. The expected life of stock options granted was based on an analysis of historical exercise patterns.\n136\nStock Incentive Plan\nThe Company has historically granted equity awards under various plans (the \"Prior Plans\"). On February 9, 2012, the Board authorized The Dow Chemical Company 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2012 Plan\"), which was approved by stockholders at TDCC's annual meeting on May 10, 2012 (\"2012 Plan Effective Date\") and became effective on that date. On February 13, 2014, the Board adopted The Dow Chemical Company Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2012 Restated Plan\"). The 2012 Restated Plan was approved by stockholders at TDCC's annual meeting on May 15, 2014, and became effective on that date. The Prior Plans were superseded by the 2012 Plan and the 2012 Restated Plan (collectively, the \"2012 Plan\"). Under the 2012 Plan, the Company granted options, RSUs, PSUs, restricted stock, stock appreciation rights and stock units to employees and non-employee directors, subject to an aggregate limit and annual individual limits. The terms of the grants were fixed at the grant date. TDCC's stock-based compensation programs were assumed by DowDuPont and continued in place with the ability to grant and issue DowDuPont common stock until separation.\nOn April 1, 2019 (\"Original Effective Date\"), in connection with the separation, the Company adopted the 2019 Stock Incentive Plan (the \"2019 Plan\"). Under the 2019 Plan, the Company may grant stock options, RSUs, PSUs, stock appreciation rights and stock units to employees and non-employee directors until the tenth anniversary of the Original Effective Date, subject to an aggregate limit and annual individual limits. The terms of the grants are fixed at the grant date. At December 31, 2021, there were approximately\n59\nmillion shares of common stock available for grant under the 2019 Plan.\nStock Options\nThe Company grants stock options to certain employees, subject to certain annual and individual limits, with terms of the grants fixed at the grant date. The exercise price of each stock option equals the market price of the common stock on the grant date. Options vest from\none year\nto\nthree years\nand have a maximum term of\nten years\n.\nThe following table summarizes stock option activity for 2021:\n1.\nWeighted-average per share.\n1.\nDifference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the options.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option awards of $\n5\nmillion at December 31, 2021, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.47\nyears.\n137\nRestricted Stock Units\nThe Company grants RSUs to certain employees and non-employee directors. The grants vest after a designated period of time, generally\nthree years\nfor employees and\ntwo years\nfor non-employee directors. The following table shows changes in nonvested RSUs:\n1.\nWeighted-average per share.\n1.\nIncludes the fair value of shares vested in prior years and delivered in the reporting year.\nIn 2021, the Company did\nnot\nsettle any RSU's in cash (approximately\n85,000\nRSUs settled in cash for $\n4\nmillion in 2020 and\n341,000\nRSUs settled in cash for $\n19\nmillion in 2019). Total unrecognized compensation cost related to RSU awards of $\n71\nmillion at December 31, 2021 is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.64\nyears. At December 31, 2021, approximately\n1.8\nmillion RSUs with a grant date weighted-average fair value per share of $\n52.92\nhad previously vested, but were not issued. These shares are scheduled to be issued to employees within six months to three years or to non-employee directors upon retirement.\nPerformance Stock Units\nThe Company grants PSUs to certain employees. The grants vest when the Company attains specified performance targets, such as return on capital, cumulative cash from operations and relative total shareholder return, over a predetermined period, generally\none year\nto\nthree years\n. Performance and payouts are determined independently for each metric. Compensation expense related to PSU awards is recognized over the lesser of the service or performance period. Changes in the fair value of liability instruments are recognized as compensation expense each quarter.\nThe following table shows the PSU awards granted:\n1.\nAt the end of the performance period, the actual number of shares issued can range from\nzero\nto\n200\npercent of target shares granted for the 2019 and 2021 awards and can range from\nzero\nto\n100\npercent of the target shares granted for the 2020 award.\n2.\nWeighted-average per share.\n138\nThe following table shows changes in nonvested PSUs:\n1.\nWeighted-average per share.\n1.\nIncludes the fair value of shares vested in prior years and delivered in the reporting year.\n2.\nPSU awards vested in prior years and delivered in the reporting year.\n3.\nCash paid to certain executive employees for PSU awards vested in prior periods and delivered in the reporting year, equal to the value of the stock award on the date of delivery\n.\nTotal unrecognized compensation cost related to PSU awards of $\n49\nmillion at December 31, 2021, is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.66\nyears.\nEmployee Stock Purchase Plan\nThe Board unanimously approved the Dow Inc. 2021 Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the \"2021 ESPP\"), which was approved by the Company's stockholders at the 2021 Annual Meeting of Stockholders held on April 15, 2021. Under the 2021 ESPP offering, most employees were eligible to purchase shares of common stock of Dow Inc. valued at up to\n10\npercent of their annual total base salary or wages. The number of shares purchased was determined using the amount contributed by the employee divided by the plan price. The plan price of the stock was equal to\n85\npercent of the fair market value (closing price) of the common stock at June 1, 2021 (beginning) or December 3, 2021 (ending) of the offering period, whichever was lower.\nIn 2021, employees subscribed to the right to purchase approximately\n2.3\nmillion shares at a weighted-average price of $\n45.11\nper share, under the 2021 ESPP. The plan price was fixed upon the close of the offering period. The shares were delivered to employees in the fourth quarter of 2021.\n1.\nDifference between the market price at exercise and the price paid by the employee to exercise the purchase rights\n.\n139\nNOTE 22 –\nFINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS\nThe following table summarizes the fair value of financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n1.\nThe Company's held-to-maturity securities primarily included treasury bills and time deposits.\n2.\nThe Company's investments in marketable securities are included in \"Other current assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n3.\nU.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other municipalities’ obligations.\n4.\nEquity securities with a readily determinable fair value.\n5.\nCost includes fair value hedge adjustment gains of $\n47\nmillion at December 31, 2021 and $\n69\nmillion at December 31, 2020 on $\n2,279\nmillion of debt at December 31, 2021 and $\n3,314\nmillion of debt at December 31, 2020.\n6.\nPresented net of cash collateral where master netting arrangements allow.\nCost approximates fair value for all other financial instruments.\nDebt Securities\nThe Company’s investments in debt securities are primarily classified as available-for-sale.\nThe following table provides the investing results from available-for-sale securities for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.\n140\nThe following table summarizes the contractual maturities of the Company’s investments in debt securities:\n1.\nIncludes marketable securities with maturities of less than one year.\nPortfolio managers regularly review the Company’s holdings to determine if any investments in debt securities are other-than-temporarily impaired. The analysis includes reviewing the amount of the impairment, as well as the length of time it has been impaired.\nThe credit rating of the issuer, current credit rating trends, the trends of the issuer’s overall sector, the ability of the issuer to pay expected cash flows and the length of time the security has been in a loss position are considered in determining whether unrealized losses represent an other-than-temporary impairment. The Company did not have any credit-related losses in 2021, 2020 or 2019.\nThe following table provides the fair value and gross unrealized losses of the Company’s investments in debt securities that were deemed to be temporarily impaired at December 31, 2021 and 2020, aggregated by investment category:\n1.\nU.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other municipalities' obligations.\nEquity Securities\nThere were no material adjustments to the carrying value of the not readily determinable investments for impairment or observable price changes for the year ended December 31, 2021. The net unrealized loss recognized in earnings on equity securities totaled $\n13\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2021 ($\n32\nmillion net unrealized gain for the year ended December 31, 2020).\n141\nRisk Management\nThe Company’s business operations give rise to market risk exposure due to changes in foreign exchange rates, interest rates, commodity prices and other market factors such as equity prices. To manage such risks effectively, the Company enters into hedging transactions, pursuant to established guidelines and policies that enable it to mitigate the adverse effects of financial market risk. Derivatives used for this purpose are designated as hedges per the accounting guidance related to derivatives and hedging activities, where appropriate. A secondary objective is to add value by creating additional non-specific exposure within established limits and policies; derivatives used for this purpose are not designated as hedges. The potential impact of creating such additional exposures is not material to the Company’s results. Accounting guidance requires companies to recognize all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value.\nThe Company’s risk management program for interest rate, foreign currency and commodity risks is based on fundamental, mathematical and technical models that take into account the implicit cost of hedging. Risks created by derivative instruments and the mark-to-market valuations of positions are strictly monitored at all times, using value-at-risk and stress tests. Counterparty credit risk arising from these contracts is not significant because the Company minimizes counterparty concentration, deals primarily with major financial institutions of solid credit quality, and the majority of its hedging transactions mature in less than three months. In addition, the Company minimizes concentrations of credit risk through its global orientation by transacting with large, internationally diversified financial counterparties. It is the Company’s policy to not have credit risk-related contingent features in its derivative instruments. No significant concentration of counterparty credit risk existed at December 31, 2021. The Company does not anticipate losses from credit risk, and the net cash requirements arising from counterparty risk associated with risk management activities are not expected to be material in 2022.\nThe Company revises its strategies as market conditions dictate and management reviews its overall financial strategies and the impacts from using derivatives in its risk management program with the Company’s senior leadership who also reviews these strategies with the Dow Inc. Board and/or relevant committees thereof.\nDerivative Instruments\nThe notional amounts of the Company's derivative instruments presented on a net basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:\nThe notional amounts of the Company's commodity derivatives presented on a net basis at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were as follows:\n142\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nThe main objective of interest rate risk management is to reduce the total funding cost to the Company and to alter the interest rate exposure to the desired risk profile. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges using interest rate swaps, “swaptions,” and exchange-traded instruments.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nThe global nature of the Company's business requires active participation in the foreign exchange markets. The Company has assets, liabilities and cash flows in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. The primary objective of the Company's foreign currency risk management is to optimize the U.S. dollar value of net assets and cash flows. To achieve this objective, the Company hedges on a net exposure basis using foreign currency forward contracts, over-the-counter option contracts, cross-currency swaps and nonderivative instruments in foreign currencies. Exposures primarily relate to assets, liabilities and bonds denominated in foreign currencies, as well as economic exposure, which is derived from the risk that currency fluctuations could affect the dollar value of future cash flows related to operating activities.\nCommodity Risk Management\nThe Company has exposure to the prices of commodities in its procurement of certain raw materials. The primary purpose of commodity hedging activities is to manage the price volatility associated with these forecasted inventory purchases.\nDerivatives Not Designated in Hedging Relationships\nForeign Currency Contracts\nThe Company also uses foreign exchange forward contracts, options and cross-currency swaps that are not designated as hedging instruments primarily to manage foreign currency exposure.\nCommodity Contracts\nThe Company utilizes futures, options and swap instruments that are effective as economic hedges of commodity price exposures, but do not meet hedge accounting criteria for derivatives and hedging, to reduce exposure to commodity price fluctuations on purchases of raw materials and inventory.\nInterest Rate Contracts\nThe Company uses swap instruments that are not designated as hedging instruments to manage interest rate exposures. The Company uses interest rate swaps, \"swaptions,\" and exchange-traded instruments to accomplish this objective.\nAccounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities\nCash Flow Hedges\nFor derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedging instruments, the gain or loss on the derivative is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to income in the same period or periods that the hedged transaction affects income. The unrealized amounts in AOCL fluctuate based on changes in the fair value of open contracts at the end of each reporting period. The Company anticipates volatility in AOCL and net income from its cash flow hedges. The amount of volatility varies with the level of derivative activities and market conditions during any period.\nThe portion of the mark-to-market effects of the foreign currency contracts is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to income in the same period or periods that the underlying item affects income.\nCommodity swaps, futures and option contracts with maturities of not more than 60 months are utilized and designated as cash flow hedges of forecasted commodity purchases. The designated portion of the mark-to-market effect of the cash flow hedge instrument is recorded in AOCL; it is reclassified to income in the same period or periods that the underlying commodity purchase affects income.\nFair Value Hedges\nFor interest rate instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedge item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current period income and reflected as “Interest expense and amortization of debt discount” in the consolidated statements of income, except for amounts excluded from the assessment of effectiveness that are recognized in earnings through an amortization approach.\n143\nNet Foreign Investment Hedges\nThe Company designates derivatives that qualify as effective net foreign investment hedges, the results of which are presented in the effect of derivative instruments table. The Company also utilizes non-derivative instruments as net foreign investment hedges. The Company had outstanding foreign-currency denominated debt designated as a hedge of net foreign investment of $\n174\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n194\nmillion at December 31, 2020).\nThe following tables provide the fair value and balance sheet classification of derivative instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n1.\nCounterparty and cash collateral amounts represent the estimated net settlement amount when applying netting and set-off rights included in master netting arrangements between the Company and its counterparties and the payable or receivable for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.\n144\n1.\nCounterparty and cash collateral amounts represent the estimated net settlement amount when applying netting and set-off rights included in master netting arrangements between the Company and its counterparties and the payable or receivable for cash collateral held or placed with the same counterparty.\nAssets and liabilities related to forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps, options and other conditional or exchange contracts executed with the same counterparty under a master netting arrangement are netted. Collateral accounts are netted with corresponding assets or liabilities, when applicable. The Company posted cash collateral of $\n71\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n7\nmillion at December 31, 2020).\nNo\ncash collateral was posted by counterparties with the Company at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020).\n145\nThe following table summarizes the gain (loss) of derivative instruments in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n1.\nOCI is defined as other comprehensive income (loss).\n2.\nPretax amounts.\n3.\nGain (loss) recognized in income of derivatives is offset by gain (loss) recognized in income of the hedged item.\n4.\nThe excluded components are related to the time value of the derivatives designated as hedges.\nThe following table provides the net after-tax amounts to be reclassified from AOCL to income within the next 12 months:\n146\nNOTE 23 –\nFAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS\nFair Value Measurements on a Recurring Basis\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis:\n1.\nThe Company's held-to-maturity securities primarily included treasury bills and time deposits.\n2.\nThe Company's investments in marketable securities are included in \"Other current assets\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n3.\nThe Company's investments in debt securities, which are primarily available-for-sale, and equity securities are included in \"Other investments\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n4.\nU.S. Treasury obligations, U.S. agency obligations, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities and other municipalities' obligations.\n5.\nSee Note 22 for the classification of derivatives in the consolidated balance sheets.\n6.\nSee Note 22 for information on fair value measurements of long-term debt.\n7.\nEstimated liability for TDCC's guarantee of Sadara's debt which is included in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets. See Note 16 for additional information.\nFor assets and liabilities classified as Level 1 measurements (measured using quoted prices in active markets), total fair value is either the price of the most recent trade at the time of the market close or the official close price, as defined by the exchange on which the asset is most actively traded on the last trading day of the period, multiplied by the number of units held without consideration of transaction costs.\nFor assets and liabilities classified as Level 2 measurements, where the security is frequently traded in less active markets, fair value is based on the closing price at the end of the period; where the security is less frequently traded, fair value is based on the price a dealer would pay for the security or similar securities, adjusted for any terms specific to that asset or liability, or by using observable market data points of similar, more liquid securities to imply the price. Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance and quality checks.\n147\nFor derivative assets and liabilities, standard industry models are used to calculate the fair value of the various financial instruments based on significant observable market inputs, such as foreign exchange rates, commodity prices, swap rates, interest rates and implied volatilities obtained from various market sources. Market inputs are obtained from well-established and recognized vendors of market data and subjected to tolerance/quality checks.\nFor all other assets and liabilities for which observable inputs are used, fair value is derived through the use of fair value models, such as a discounted cash flow model or other standard pricing models. See Note 22 for further information on the types of instruments used by the Company for risk management.\nThere were\nno\ntransfers between Levels 1 and 2 in the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nFor liabilities classified as Level 3 measurements, the fair value is based on significant unobservable inputs including assumptions where there is little, if any, market activity. The fair value of the Company’s accrued liability related to the guarantee of Sadara's debt is in proportion to the Company's 35 percent ownership interest in Sadara. The estimated fair value of the guarantee was calculated using a \"with\" and \"without\" method. The fair value of the debt was calculated \"with\" the guarantee less the fair value of the debt \"without\" the guarantee. The \"with\" and \"without\" values were calculated using a discounted cash flow method based on contractual cash flows as well as projected prepayments made on the debt by Sadara. See Note 16 for further information on guarantees classified as Level 3 measurements.\nThe following table summarizes the changes in fair value measurements using Level 3 inputs for the year ended December 31, 2021:\n1.\nIncluded in \"Other noncurrent obligations\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n2.\nIncluded in \"Equity in earnings (losses) of nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the consolidated income statements.\nFor equity securities calculated at net asset value per share (or its equivalent), the Company had $\n106\nmillion in private equity and $\n22\nmillion in real estate at December 31, 2021 ($\n111\nmillion in private equity and $\n19\nmillion in real estate at December 31, 2020). There are no redemption restrictions and the unfunded commitments on these investments were $\n59\nmillion at December 31, 2021 ($\n63\nmillion at December 31, 2020).\nFair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe following table summarizes the bases used to measure certain assets at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\n2021 Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis\nThe Company's fair value measurements on a nonrecurring basis were insignificant in 2021.\n148\n2020 Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAs part of the 2020 Restructuring Program, the Company has or will shut down and write off several small manufacturing facilities and miscellaneous assets around the world. The assets associated with this plan were written down to zero. In addition, impairments of leased, non-manufacturing facilities, which were classified as Level 3 measurements, resulted in a write-down of right-of-use assets to a fair value of $\n110\nmillion using unobservable inputs. The impairment charges related to the 2020 Restructuring Program, totaling $\n196\nmillion, were included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n11\nmillion), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n22\nmillion), Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n116\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n47\nmillion).\nIn 2020, the Company recognized impairment charges of $\n30\nmillion related to the write-down of a non-manufacturing asset and certain corporate leased equipment and the write-off of a capital project. The assets, classified as Level 3 measurements, were valued at $\n11\nmillion using unobservable inputs. The impairment charges were included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n15\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n15\nmillion).\nIn 2020, the Company recognized an additional pretax impairment charge of $\n19\nmillion related to capital additions made to a bio-ethanol manufacturing facility in Santa Vitoria, Minas Gerais, Brazil, which was impaired in 2017. The assets were written down to zero in 2020. The impairment charge was included in “Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics. On September 29, 2020, the Company divested the bio-ethanol manufacturing facility. See Note 6 for additional information.\n2019 Fair Value Measurements on a Nonrecurring Basis\nAs part of the Synergy Program, the Company has or will shut down and write-off several small manufacturing facilities, non-manufacturing assets and certain corporate facilities around the world. In 2019, manufacturing facilities associated with this plan were written down to zero. In addition, impairments of leased, non-manufacturing facilities, which were classified as Level 3 measurements, resulted in a write-down of right-of-use assets to a fair value of $\n152\nmillion using unobservable inputs. The impairment charges related to the Synergy Program, totaling $\n143\nmillion, were included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n2\nmillion), Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n28\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n113\nmillion).\nIn 2019, the Company recognized an additional pretax impairment charge of $\n44\nmillion related to capital additions made to Santa Vitoria, which was impaired in 2017. The assets were written down to zero in 2019. The impairment charge was included in “Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics.\nIn 2019, the Company recognized impairment charges of $\n14\nmillion related to non-manufacturing assets. The assets, classified as Level 3 measurements, were valued at $\n10\nmillion using unobservable inputs. The impairment charges were included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Performance Materials & Coatings ($\n9\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n5\nmillion).\nIn 2019, the Company recognized an impairment charge of $\n75\nmillion resulting from the planned divestiture of its acetone derivatives business to ALTIVIA Ketones & Additives, LLC. The transaction closed on November 1, 2019 and included the Company's acetone derivatives related inventory and production assets, located in Institute, West Virginia, in addition to the site infrastructure, land and utilities. The assets, classified as Level 3 measurements and valued using unobservable inputs, were written down to zero in 2019, except for inventory, which was sold at the lower of cost or market. The impairment charge was included in \"Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net\" in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n24\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n51\nmillion).\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company performed its annual goodwill impairment testing utilizing a discounted cash flow methodology as its valuation technique. As a result, the Company determined the fair value of the C&PM reporting unit was lower than its carrying amount and recorded an impairment charge of $\n1,039\nmillion, included in “Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Performance Materials & Coatings. See Note 13 for additional information on the impairment charge.\n149\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, the Company concluded that its equity method investment in Sadara, classified as a Level 3 measurement and valued using unobservable inputs, was other-than-temporarily impaired and written down to zero. Additionally, the Company reserved certain accounts and notes receivable and accrued interest balances due to uncertainty on the timing of collection. As a result, the Company recorded a $\n1,755\nmillion charge related to Sadara. The charge was included in “Restructuring, goodwill impairment and asset related charges - net” in the consolidated statements of income and related to Packaging & Specialty Plastics ($\n370\nmillion), Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure ($\n1,168\nmillion) and Corporate ($\n217\nmillion). See Note 12 for additional information.\nSee Note 6 for additional information on the Company's restructuring activities.\nNOTE 24 –\nVARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES\nConsolidated Variable Interest Entities (\"VIEs\")\nThe Company holds a variable interest in the following joint ventures or entities for which it is the primary beneficiary:\nAsia Pacific Joint Ventures\nThe Company has variable interests in two joint ventures that own and operate manufacturing and logistics facilities, which produce chemicals and provide services in Asia Pacific. The Company's variable interests in these joint ventures relate to arrangements between the joint ventures and the Company, involving the majority of the output on take-or-pay terms with pricing ensuring a guaranteed return to the joint ventures.\nThe Company was a 50 percent indirect owner in a propylene oxide (\"PO\") manufacturing joint venture in Asia Pacific. The Company had a variable interest in this joint venture relating to arrangements between the joint venture and the Company involving the majority of the output on take-or-pay terms, with pricing ensuring a guaranteed return to the joint venture. On April 30, 2019, the Company executed an agreement to acquire full ownership in the PO manufacturing joint venture. The transaction closed on October 1, 2019, for a cash purchase price of $\n331\nmillion. Approximately half of the purchase price was attributed to the Company’s proportionate equity interest in the entity that owned the PO manufacturing joint venture, which was accounted for under the equity method of accounting, and was classified as \"Investments in and loans to nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows. The remaining $\n166\nmillion was classified as \"Purchases of noncontrolling interests\" in the consolidated statements of cash flows.\nEthylene Storage Joint Venture\nThe Company has variable interests in a joint venture that provides ethylene storage in Alberta, Canada. The Company's variable interests relate to arrangements involving a majority of the joint venture's storage capacity on take-or-pay terms with pricing ensuring a guaranteed return to the joint venture; and favorably priced leases provided to the joint venture. The Company provides the joint venture with operation and maintenance services and utilities.\nAssets and Liabilities of Consolidated VIEs\nThe Company's consolidated financial statements include the assets, liabilities and results of operations of VIEs for which the Company is the primary beneficiary. The other equity holders’ interests are reflected in \"Net income attributable to noncontrolling interests\" in the consolidated statements of income and \"Noncontrolling interests\" in the consolidated balance sheets.\n150\nThe following table summarizes the carrying amounts of these entities’ assets and liabilities included in the Company’s consolidated balance sheets at December 31, 2021 and 2020:\n1.\nAll assets were restricted at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\n2.\nAll liabilities were nonrecourse at December 31, 2021 and 2020.\nAmounts presented in the consolidated balance sheets and the table above as restricted assets or nonrecourse obligations relating to consolidated VIEs at December 31, 2021 and 2020 are adjusted for intercompany eliminations.\nNonconsolidated VIEs\nThe Company holds a variable interest in the following entities for which the Company is not the primary beneficiary:\nSilicon Joint Ventures\nThe Company holds minority voting interests in certain joint ventures that produce silicon inputs for the Company. These joint ventures operate under supply agreements that sell inventory to the equity owners using pricing mechanisms that guarantee a return, therefore shielding the joint ventures from the obligation to absorb expected losses. As a result of the pricing mechanisms of these agreements, these entities are determined to be VIEs. The Company is not the primary beneficiary, as it does not hold the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of these entities; therefore, the entities are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. The Company's maximum exposure to loss as a result of its involvement with these variable interest entities is determined to be the carrying value of the investment in these entities. At December 31, 2021, the Company's investment in these joint ventures was $\n110\nmillion ($\n107\nmillion at December 31, 2020), classified as \"Investment in nonconsolidated affiliates\" in the consolidated balance sheets, representing the Company's maximum exposure to loss.\nNOTE 25 –\nRELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS\nEffective with the separation from DowDuPont on April 1, 2019, TDCC became a wholly owned subsidiary of Dow Inc. and reported transactions with Dow Inc. as related party transactions. From the Merger Date through March 31, 2019, TDCC reported transactions with DowDuPont and Historical DuPont and its affiliates as related party transactions.\nTDCC\nTDCC has committed to fund Dow Inc.'s dividends paid to common stockholders and share repurchases, as approved by Dow Inc.'s Board from time to time, as well as certain governance expenses. Funding is accomplished through intercompany loans. TDCC's Board reviews and determines a dividend distribution to Dow Inc. to settle the intercompany loans.\nThe following table summarizes cash dividends TDCC declared and paid to Dow Inc. for the years ended 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, TDCC's intercompany loan balance with Dow Inc. was insignificant.\n151\nDowDuPont\nPursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of December 11, 2015, as amended on March 31, 2017, and prior to the separation from DowDuPont, TDCC committed to fund a portion of DowDuPont's dividends paid to common stockholders and certain governance expenses. In 2019, TDCC declared and paid dividends to DowDuPont of $\n535\nmillion.\nHistorical DuPont and its Affiliates\nPrior to the separation from DowDuPont, TDCC sold to and procured from Historical DuPont and its affiliates certain raw materials that were consumed in each company's manufacturing process.\nThe following table presents revenue earned and expenses incurred related to transactions with Historical DuPont and its affiliates:\nPurchases from Historical DuPont and its affiliates were insignificant for 2019.\nNOTE 26 –\nSEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS\nDow combines global breadth; asset integration and scale; focused innovation and materials science expertise; leading business positions; and environmental, social and governance (ESG) leadership to achieve profitable growth and deliver a sustainable future. The Company’s ambition is to become the most innovative, customer centric, inclusive and sustainable materials science company in the world.\nDow’s portfolio of plastics, industrial intermediates, coatings and silicones businesses delivers a broad range of differentiated, science-based products and solutions for its customers in high-growth market segments, such as packaging, infrastructure, mobility and consumer applications. Dow operates\n104\nmanufacturing sites in\n31\ncountries and employs approximately\n35,700\npeople.\nThe Company conducts its worldwide operations through six global businesses which are organized into the following operating segments: Packaging & Specialty Plastics, Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure and Performance Materials & Coatings. Corporate contains the reconciliation between the totals for the operating segments and the Company's totals. The Company did not aggregate any operating segments when determining its reportable segments. The Company reports geographic information for the following regions: U.S. & Canada, Asia Pacific, Latin America and EMEAI. The Company transfers ethylene to its downstream derivative businesses at market prices. The Company also allocated costs previously assigned to AgCo and SpecCo (\"stranded costs\") to the operating segments.\nDow’s measure of profit/loss for segment reporting purposes is Operating EBIT (for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020) and pro forma Operating EBIT (for the year ended December 31, 2019) as this is the manner in which the Company's chief operating decision maker (\"CODM\") assesses performance and allocates resources. The Company defines Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, excluding the impact of significant items. The Company defines pro forma Operating EBIT as earnings (i.e., \"Income (loss) from continuing operations before income taxes\") before interest, plus pro forma adjustments, excluding the impact of significant items. Operating EBIT and pro forma Operating EBIT by segment include all operating items relating to the businesses; items that principally apply to Dow as a whole are assigned to Corporate. The Company also presents pro forma net sales for the year ended December 31, 2019 in this footnote as it is included in management's measure of segment performance and is regularly reviewed by the CODM. Pro forma net sales includes the impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont.\n152\nCorporate Profile\nDow conducts its worldwide operations through global businesses which are reflected in the following reportable segments:\nPackaging & Specialty Plastics\nThe Packaging & Specialty Plastics operating segment consists of two highly integrated global businesses: Hydrocarbons & Energy and Packaging and Specialty Plastics. The segment employs the industry’s broadest polyolefin product portfolio, supported by the Company’s proprietary catalyst and manufacturing process technologies. These differentiators, plus collaboration at the customer’s design table, enable the segment to deliver more reliable, durable, higher-performing solutions designed for recyclability and enhanced plastics circularity and sustainability. The segment serves customers, brand owners and ultimately consumers in key markets including food and specialty packaging; industrial and consumer packaging; health and hygiene; caps, closures and pipe applications; consumer durables; mobility and transportation; and infrastructure. This segment includes the results of The Kuwait Styrene Company K.S.C.C. and The SCG-Dow Group, as well as a portion of the results of EQUATE, The Kuwait Olefins Company K.S.C.C. (\"TKOC\"), Map Ta Phut and Sadara, all joint ventures of the Company.\nIndustrial Intermediates & Infrastructure\nThe Industrial Intermediates & Infrastructure operating segment consists of two customer-centric global businesses - Industrial Solutions and Polyurethanes & Construction Chemicals - that develop important intermediate chemicals that are essential to manufacturing processes, as well as downstream, customized materials and formulations that use advanced development technologies. These businesses primarily produce and market ethylene oxide and propylene oxide derivatives that are aligned to market segments as diverse as appliances, coatings, electronics, surfactants for cleaning and sanitization, infrastructure and oil and gas. The businesses' global scale and reach, world-class technology, research and development capabilities and materials science expertise enable the Company to be a premier solutions provider offering customers value-add sustainable solutions to enhance comfort, energy efficiency, product effectiveness and durability across a wide range of home comfort and appliance, building and construction, mobility and transportation, adhesive and lubricant applications, among others. This segment includes a portion of the Company's share of the results of EQUATE, TKOC, Map Ta Phut and Sadara.\nPerformance Materials & Coatings\nThe Performance Materials & Coatings operating segment includes industry-leading franchises that deliver a wide array of solutions into consumer, infrastructure and mobility end-markets. The segment consists of two global businesses: Coatings & Performance Monomers and Consumer Solutions. These businesses primarily utilize the Company's acrylics-, cellulosics- and silicone-based technology platforms to serve the needs of the architectural and industrial coatings; home care and personal care; consumer and electronics; mobility and transportation; industrial and chemical processing; and building and infrastructure end-markets. Both businesses employ materials science capabilities, global reach and unique products and technology to combine chemistry platforms to deliver differentiated, market-driven and sustainable innovations to customers.\nCorporate\nCorporate includes certain enterprise and governance activities (including insurance operations, environmental operations, etc.); non-business aligned joint ventures; non-business aligned litigation expenses; and discontinued or non-aligned businesses.\n153\nSales are attributed to geographic region based on customer location; long-lived assets are attributed to geographic region based on asset location.\n1.\nSee Note 6 for information regarding the Company's restructuring programs, goodwill impairment and other asset related charges.\n2.\nOperating EBIT for TDCC in 2021 and 2020 is substantially the same as that of Dow Inc. and therefore is not disclosed separately in the table above. A reconciliation of \"Income from continuing operations, net of tax\" to Operating EBIT is provided on the following page.\n3.\nPro forma Operating EBIT for TDCC in 2019 is substantially the same as that of Dow Inc. and therefore is not disclosed separately in the table above. A reconciliation of \"Income (loss) from continuing operations, net of tax\" to pro forma Operating EBIT is provided on the following page.\n154\n1.\nPro forma adjustments include: (1) the margin impact of various manufacturing, supply and service related agreements entered into with DuPont and Corteva in connection with the separation which provide for different pricing than the historical intercompany and intracompany pricing practices of TDCC and Historical DuPont, (2) the removal of the amortization of ECP's inventory step-up recognized in connection with the Merger and (3) the elimination of the impact of events directly attributable to the Merger, internal reorganization and business realignment, separation, distribution and other related transactions (e.g., one-time transaction costs).\nThe following tables summarize the pretax impact of significant items by segment that are excluded from Operating EBIT and pro forma Operating EBIT:\n1.\nIncludes costs associated with implementing the Company's digital acceleration program.\n2.\nIncludes Board approved restructuring plans, including costs associated with implementing the Company's 2020 Restructuring Program, and asset-related charges, which include other asset impairments.

Based upon that evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer concluded that the Companies' disclosure controls and procedures were effective.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThere were no changes in the Companies' internal control over financial reporting identified in connection with the evaluation required by paragraph (d) of Exchange Act Rules 13a-15 and 15d-15 that was conducted during the last fiscal quarter that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, the Companies' internal control over financial reporting.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nManagement is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting. The Companies' internal control framework and processes are designed to provide reasonable assurance to management and the Board of Directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the Companies' consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nThe Companies' internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that:\n•\npertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the Companies;\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the Companies are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and Directors of the Companies; and\n•\nprovide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use or disposition of the Companies' assets that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, any system of internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance and may not prevent or detect misstatements.\nManagement assessed the effectiveness of the Companies' internal control over financial reporting and concluded that, as of December 31, 2021, such internal control is effective. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”) in\nInternal Control—Integrated Framework (2013).\nThe Companies' independent auditors, Deloitte & Touche LLP, with direct access to the Companies' Board of Directors through the Audit Committee of Dow Inc., have audited the consolidated financial statements prepared by the Companies.
