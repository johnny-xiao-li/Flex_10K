    "text": "General Development of Business\nSummary Description of Chevron\nChevron Corporation,\n*\na Delaware corporation, manages its investments in subsidiaries and affiliates and provides administrative, financial, management and technology support to U.S. and international subsidiaries that engage in integrated energy and chemicals operations. Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; processing, liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas; transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses and fuel and lubricant additives.\nA list of the company’s major subsidiaries is presented in\n.\nOverview of Petroleum Industry\nPetroleum industry operations and profitability are influenced by many factors. Prices for crude oil, natural gas, petroleum products and petrochemicals are generally determined by supply and demand. Production levels from the members of Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and the United States are the major factors in determining worldwide supply. Demand for crude oil and its products and for natural gas is largely driven by the conditions of local, national and global economies, although weather patterns, the pace of energy transition and taxation relative to other energy sources also play a significant part. Laws and governmental policies, particularly in the areas of taxation, energy and the environment, affect where and how companies invest, conduct their operations, select feedstocks, and formulate their products and, in some cases, limit their profits directly.\nStrong competition exists in all sectors of the petroleum and petrochemical industries in supplying the energy, fuel and chemical needs of industry and individual consumers. In the upstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major global petroleum companies, as well as independent and national petroleum companies, for the acquisition of crude oil and natural gas leases and other properties and for the equipment and labor required to develop and operate those properties. In its downstream business, Chevron competes with fully integrated, major petroleum companies, as well as independent refining and marketing, transportation and chemicals entities and national petroleum companies in the refining, manufacturing, sale and marketing of fuels, lubricants, additives and petrochemicals.\nOperating Environment\nRefer to pages 32 through 40 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s current business environment and outlook.\nChevron’s Strategic Direction\nChevron’s strategy is to leverage its strengths to deliver lower carbon energy to a growing world. The company’s primary objective is to deliver higher returns, lower carbon and superior shareholder value in any business environment. In the upstream, the company’s strategy is to deliver industry-leading returns while developing high-value resource opportunities. In the downstream, the company’s strategy is to be the leading downstream and chemicals company that delivers on customer needs. Chevron aims to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer relationships.\nInformation about the company is available on the company’s website at\nwww.chevron.com\n. Information contained on the company’s website is not part of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. The company’s Annual Reports on Form 10-K, Quarterly Reports on Form 10-Q, Current Reports on Form 8-K, and any amendments to these reports filed or furnished pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge on the company’s website soon after such reports are filed with or furnished to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The reports are also available on the SEC’s website at\nwww.sec.gov\n.\n________________________________________________________\n*\nIncorporated in Delaware in 1926 as Standard Oil Company of California, the company adopted the name Chevron Corporation in 1984 and ChevronTexaco Corporation in 2001. In 2005, ChevronTexaco Corporation changed its name to Chevron Corporation. As used in this report, the term “Chevron” and such terms as “the company,” “the corporation,” “our,” “we,” “us” and \"its\" may refer to Chevron Corporation, one or more of its consolidated subsidiaries, or all of them taken as a whole, but unless stated otherwise they do not include “affiliates” of Chevron — i.e., those companies accounted for by the equity method (generally owned 50 percent or less) or non-equity method investments. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of any of the separate companies, each of which manages its own affairs.\n3\nHuman Capital Management\nChevron invests in its employees and culture, with the objective of developing the full potential of its workforce to deliver energy solutions and drive human progress. The Chevron Way explains the company’s beliefs, vision, purpose and values. It guides how the company’s employees work and establishes a common understanding of culture and aspirations. Chevron hires, develops, and strives to retain a diverse workforce of high-performing talent, and fosters a culture that values diversity, inclusion and employee engagement. Chevron leadership is accountable for the company’s investment in people and the company’s culture. This includes reviews of metrics addressing critical function hiring, leadership development, retention, diversity and inclusion, and employee engagement.\nThe following table summarizes the number of Chevron employees by gender, where data is available, and by region as of December 31, 2021.\n1\nIncludes employees where gender data was not collected or employee chose not to disclose gender.\nHiring, Development and Retention\nThe company’s approach to attracting, developing and retaining a diverse workforce of high-performing talent is anchored in a long-term employment model that fosters an environment of personal growth and engagement. Chevron’s philosophy is to offer compelling career opportunities and a competitive total compensation and benefits package linked to individual and enterprise performance. Chevron recruits new employees in part through partnerships with universities and diversity associations. In addition, the company recruits experienced hires to provide specialized skills.\nChevron’s learning and development programs are designed to help employees achieve their full potential by building technical, operating and leadership capabilities at all levels to produce energy safely, reliably and efficiently. Chevron’s leadership regularly reviews metrics on employee training and development programs, which are continually evolving to meet the needs of our evolving business. For example, the company delivers learning experiences digitally to empower its employees, in any location, to develop, maintain and enhance critical skills. In addition, to ensure business continuity, leadership regularly reviews the talent pipeline, identifies and develops succession candidates, and builds succession plans for key positions. The Board of Directors provides oversight of CEO and executive succession planning.\nManagement routinely reviews the retention of its professional population, which includes executives, all levels of management, and the majority of its regular employee population. The annual voluntary attrition for this population was 4.5 percent, which is in line with rates over a five-year comparison period. The voluntary attrition rate generally excludes employee departures under enterprise-wide restructuring programs. Chevron believes its low voluntary attrition rate is in part a result of the company’s commitment to employee development, its long-term employment model, competitive pay and benefits, and its culture.\nDiversity and Inclusion\nChevron believes innovative solutions to the most complex challenges emerge when diverse people, ideas, and experiences come together in an inclusive environment. Chevron reinforces the values of diversity and inclusion through recruitment and talent development, equitable selection processes, community partnerships and supplier diversity. Examples of\n4\ninitiatives to further advance diversity and inclusion include the company’s MARC (Men Advocating Real Change) program launched in 2017 in partnership with the non-profit organization Catalyst to facilitate discussions on gender equity in the workplace, and selection processes that reinforce the importance of diverse selection teams and candidate slates. In addition, Chevron has twelve employee networks (voluntary groups of employees that come together based on shared identity or interests) and a Chairman’s Inclusion Council, which provides the employee network presidents with a direct line of communication to the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Human Resources Officer, the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, and the executive leadership team to collaborate and discuss how employee networks can reinforce Chevron’s values of diversity and inclusion.\nEmployee Engagement\nEmployee engagement is an indicator of employee well-being and commitment to the company’s values, purpose and strategies. Chevron regularly conducts employee surveys to assess the health of the company’s culture; recent surveys indicate high employee engagement. In 2021, the company increased survey frequency to better understand employee sentiment throughout the year, including focused efforts to gain insights into employee well-being. Chevron prioritizes the health, safety and well-being of its employees. Chevron’s safety culture empowers every member of its workforce to exercise stop-work authority without repercussion to address any potential unsafe work conditions. Chevron developed new safeguards and operating standards and updated existing protocols to adjust for the ever-changing conditions of the pandemic, including a return to the workplace strategy, with paced, condition-based stages. The company also announced a hybrid work model based on employee feedback and learnings from the pandemic, which will allow certain employees the flexibility to combine in-office and remote work. Additionally, the company offers long-standing employee support programs such as Ombuds, an independent resource designed to equip employees with options to address and resolve workplace issues; a company hotline, where employees can report concerns to the Corporate Compliance department; and an Employee Assistance Program, a confidential consulting service that can help employees resolve a broad range of personal, family and work-related concerns.\n5\nDescription of Business and Properties\nThe upstream and downstream activities of the company and its equity affiliates are widely dispersed geographically, with operations and projects\n*\nin North America, South America, Europe, Africa, Asia and Australia. Tabulations of segment sales and other operating revenues, earnings, assets, and income taxes for the three years ending December 31, 2021, and assets as of the end of 2021 and 2020 — for the United States and the company’s international geographic areas — are in\nto the Consolidated Financial Statements. Similar comparative data for the company’s investments in and income from equity affiliates and property, plant and equipment are in\nand\n. Refer to page 45 of this Form 10-K in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations for a discussion of the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures.\nUpstream\nReserves\nRefer to\nfor a tabulation of the company’s proved reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2019 and at each year-end from 2019 through 2021. Reserves governance, technologies used in establishing proved reserves additions, and major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ended December 31, 2021, are summarized in the discussion for Table V. Discussion is also provided regarding the nature of, status of, and planned future activities associated with the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The company recognizes reserves for projects with various development periods, sometimes exceeding five years. The external factors that impact the duration of a project include scope and complexity, remoteness or adverse operating conditions, infrastructure constraints, and contractual limitations.\nAt December 31, 2021, 34 percent of the company’s net proved oil-equivalent reserves were located in the United States, 19 percent were located in Australia and 16 percent were located in Kazakhstan.\nThe net proved reserve balances at the end of each of the three years 2019 through 2021 are shown in the following table:\n1\nOil-equivalent conversion ratio is 6,000 cubic feet of natural gas = 1 barrel of crude oil\n.\n________________________________________________________\n*\nAs used in this report, the term “project” may describe new upstream development activity, individual phases in a multiphase development, maintenance activities, certain existing assets, new investments in downstream and chemicals capacity, investments in emerging and sustainable energy activities, and certain other activities. All of these terms are used for convenience only and are not intended as a precise description of the term “project” as it relates to any specific governmental law or regulation.\n6\nNet Production of Liquids and Natural Gas\nThe following table summarizes the net production of liquids and natural gas for 2021 and 2020 by the company and its affiliates. Worldwide oil-equivalent production of 3.099 million barrels per day in 2021 was up approximately 1 percent from 2020. Additional production from the Noble Energy, Inc. (Noble) acquisition and lower production curtailments were partially offset by asset sale related decreases of 80,000 barrels per day, expiration of the Rokan concession in Indonesia, unfavorable entitlement effects, and normal field declines. Refer to the\nsection beginning on page 38 for a detailed discussion of the factors explaining the changes in production for crude oil, condensate, natural gas liquids, synthetic oil and natural gas, and refer to\nfor information on annual production by geographical region.\n7\nProduction Outlook\nThe company estimates its average worldwide oil-equivalent production in 2022 to be flat to down three percent compared to 2021 assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of asset sales that may close in 2022. Excluding contract expirations and 2022 asset sales, 2022 production is expected to increase by two to five percent compared to 2021. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, as described beginning on page 35. Refer to the “Review of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas,” beginning on page 10, for a discussion of the company’s major crude oil and natural gas development projects.\nAverage Sales Prices and Production Costs per Unit of Production\nRefer to\nfor the company’s average sales price per barrel of crude (including crude oil and condensate) and natural gas liquids and per thousand cubic feet of natural gas produced, and the average production cost per oil-equivalent barrel for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nGross and Net Productive Wells\nThe following table summarizes gross and net productive wells at year-end 2021 for the company and its affiliates:\nAcreage\nAt December 31, 2021, the company owned or had under lease or similar agreements undeveloped and developed crude oil and natural gas properties throughout the world. The geographical distribution of the company’s acreage is shown in the following table:\nDelivery Commitments\nThe company sells crude oil and natural gas from its producing operations under a variety of contractual obligations. Most contracts generally commit the company to sell quantities based on production from specified properties, but some natural gas and crude oil sales contracts specify delivery of fixed and determinable quantities.\n8\nIn the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver approximately 16 million barrels of crude oil and 759 billion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts through a combination of equity production from the company’s proved developed U.S. reserves and third-party purchases. These commitments are primarily based on contracts with indexed pricing terms.\nOutside the United States, the company is contractually committed to deliver a total of 2.9 trillion cubic feet of natural gas to third parties from 2022 through 2024 from operations in Australia and Israel. The Australia sales contracts contain variable pricing formulas that generally reference the prevailing market price for crude oil, natural gas or other petroleum products at the time of delivery. The sales contracts for Israel contain formulas that generally reflect an initial base price subject to price indexation, Brent-linked or other, over the life of the contract. The company believes it can satisfy these contracts from quantities available from production of the company’s proved developed reserves in these countries.\nDevelopment Activities\nRefer to\nfor details associated with the company’s development expenditures and costs of proved property acquisitions for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the company’s net interest in productive and dry development wells completed in each of the past three years, and the status of the company’s development wells drilling at December 31, 2021. A “development well” is a well drilled within the known area of a crude oil or natural gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive.\nExploration Activities\nRefer to\nfor detail on the company’s exploration expenditures and costs of unproved property acquisitions for 2021, 2020 and 2019.\nThe following table summarizes the company’s net interests in productive and dry exploratory wells completed in each of the last three years, and the number of exploratory wells drilling at December 31, 2021. “Exploratory wells” are wells drilled to find and produce crude oil or natural gas in unknown areas and include delineation and appraisal wells, which are wells drilled to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of crude oil or natural gas in another reservoir or to extend a known reservoir.\n9\nReview of Ongoing Exploration and Production Activities in Key Areas\nChevron has exploration and production activities in many of the world’s major hydrocarbon basins. Chevron’s 2021 key upstream activities, some of which are also discussed in Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, beginning on page 38, are presented below. The comments include references to “total production” and “net production,” which are defined under “Production” in\n.\nThe discussion that follows references the status of proved reserves recognition for significant long-lead-time projects not on production as well as for projects recently placed on production. Reserves are not discussed for exploration activities or recent discoveries that have not advanced to a project stage, or for mature areas of production that do not have individual projects requiring significant levels of capital or exploratory investment.\nUnited States\nUpstream activities in the United States are primarily located in Texas, New Mexico, California, Colorado, and the Gulf of Mexico. Acreage for the United States can be found in the table on page 8. Net daily oil-equivalent production in the United States can be found in the table on page 7.\nChevron is one of the largest producers in the Permian Basin with a production outlook of more than one million barrels of net oil equivalent production per day by 2025. The company’s advantaged portfolio of development areas in west Texas and southeast New Mexico is comprised of stacked formations enabling production from multiple geologic zones from single surface locations. Chevron has implemented a Permian factory development strategy utilizing multi-well pads to drill a series of horizontal wells that are subsequently completed concurrently using hydraulic fracture stimulation. Top tier drilling and completions performance has enabled year-over-year capital expenditure efficiency improvement and cycle time reduction generating higher returns throughout Chevron’s Permian portfolio. Chevron’s Permian operations have also demonstrated continual progress on its lower carbon and water goals, consistently ranking among the best Permian operators for methane emissions intensity, routine flaring, and water handling (utilizing 99 percent brackish or recycled sources). In 2021, Chevron’s net daily unconventional production in the Permian Basin averaged 284,000 barrels of crude oil, 1.1 billion cubic feet of natural gas and 148,000 barrels of NGLs. Conventional production averaged 10,000 barrels of crude oil, 39 million cubic feet of natural gas and 2,000 barrels of NGLs per day.\nChevron holds mature assets in the Eagle Ford Shale in Texas that produced 29,000 barrels of oil-equivalent per day in 2021.\nIn 2021, Chevron was one of the largest crude oil producers in California with a net daily oil equivalent production of 96,000 barrels. Chevron completed front-end engineering and design (FEED) in second quarter 2021 on a carbon capture project for emissions reduction from the gas turbines in one of our California co-generation facilities. This project leverages two innovative technologies—carbon dioxide concentration and carbon capture—and has the potential to scale across our full fleet of turbines. A final investment decision for this project is expected in third quarter\n2022, with anticipated start-up in 2024. Chevron is also progressing the installation of a 20MWh battery at the solar power plant in the Lost Hills field with start-up expected in third quarter 2022.\nIn Colorado, development in the Denver-Julesburg (DJ) Basin is primarily focused on Chevron’s Mustang and Wells Ranch areas where the company’s comprehensive drilling plans allow for efficient resource development. Chevron’s net daily production in the DJ Basin averaged 56,000 barrels of crude oil, 302 million cubic feet of natural gas and 36,000 barrels of NGLs during 2021.\nChevron also has operations in Colorado’s Piceance Basin as well as acreage positions in Wyoming and Utah.\nDuring 2021, net daily production in the Gulf of Mexico averaged 180,000 barrels of crude oil, 102 million cubic feet of natural gas and 12,000 barrels of NGLs. Chevron is engaged in various operated and nonoperated exploration, development and production activities in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico. Chevron also holds nonoperated interests in several shelf fields.\nThe deepwater Jack and St. Malo fields are being jointly developed with a host floating production unit located between the two fields.

    "text": "As a global energy company, Chevron is subject to a variety of risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations and financial condition.\nBUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL RISK FACTORS\nImpacts of the continuation or further resurgences of the COVID-19 pandemic may have an adverse and potentially material adverse effect on Chevron’s financial and operating results\nThe economic, business, and oil and gas industry impacts from the COVID-19 pandemic and the disruption to capital markets have been and continue to be far reaching. While the oil and gas industry witnessed a substantial recovery of commodity prices and demand for products during 2021, there continues to be uncertainty and unpredictability about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on our financial and operating results in future periods. The extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic adversely impacts our future financial and operating results, and for what duration and magnitude, depends on several factors that are continuing to evolve, are difficult to predict and, in many instances, are beyond the company's control. Such factors include the duration and scope of the pandemic, including any further resurgences of the COVID-19 virus and its variants, and the impact on our workforce and operations; the negative impact of the pandemic on the economy and economic activity, including travel restrictions and prolonged low demand for our products; the ability of our affiliates, suppliers and partners to successfully navigate the impacts of the pandemic; the actions taken by governments, businesses and individuals in response to the pandemic; the actions of OPEC and other countries that otherwise impact supply and demand and, correspondingly, commodity prices; the extent and duration of recovery of economies and demand for our products after the pandemic subsides; and Chevron’s ability to keep its cost model in line with changing demand for our products.\nThe company’s suppliers continue to be impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and access to materials, supplies, and contract labor has been strained. This strain on the financial health of the company’s suppliers could put pressure on the company’s financial results and may negatively impact supply assurance and supplier performance. In-country conditions, including potential future waves of the COVID-19 virus and its variants in countries that appear to have reduced their infection rates, could impact logistics and material movement and remain a risk to business continuity.\nIn light of the significant uncertainty around the duration and extent of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, management is currently unable to develop with any level of confidence estimates and assumptions that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period. In addition, the unprecedented nature of such market conditions could cause current management estimates and assumptions to be challenged in hindsight.\nIn addition, the continuation or further resurgences of the pandemic could precipitate or aggravate the other risk factors identified in this Form 10-K, which in turn could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, liquidity, results of operations and profitability, including in ways not currently known or considered by us to present significant risks.\nChevron is exposed to the effects of changing commodity prices\nChevron is primarily in a commodities business that has a history of price volatility. The single largest variable that affects the company’s results of operations is the price of crude oil, which can be influenced by general economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions that might be imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries or other producers, weather-related damage and disruptions due to other natural or human causes beyond our control (including without limitation due to the COVID-19 pandemic), competing fuel prices, geopolitical risks, the pace of energy transition, and governmental regulations and policies regarding the development of oil and gas reserves. Chevron evaluates the risk of changing commodity prices as a core part of its business planning process. An investment in the company carries significant exposure to fluctuations in global crude oil prices.\nExtended periods of low prices for crude oil can have a material adverse impact on the company’s results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Among other things, the company’s upstream earnings, cash flows, and capital and exploratory expenditure programs could be negatively affected, as could its production and proved reserves. Upstream assets may also become impaired. Downstream earnings could be negatively affected because they depend upon the supply and demand for refined products and the associated margins on refined product sales. A significant or sustained decline in liquidity could adversely affect the company’s credit ratings, potentially increase financing costs and reduce access to capital markets. The company may be unable to realize anticipated cost savings, expenditure reductions and asset sales that are intended to compensate for such downturns, and such downturns may also slow the pace and scale at which we are able to invest in new business lines such as the lower carbon businesses associated with our Chevron New Energies\n20\norganization. In some cases, liabilities associated with divested assets may return to the company when an acquirer of those assets subsequently declares bankruptcy. In addition, extended periods of low commodity prices can have a material adverse impact on the results of operations, financial condition and liquidity of the company’s suppliers, vendors, partners and equity affiliates upon which the company’s own results of operations and financial condition depends.\nThe scope of Chevron’s business will decline if the company does not successfully develop resources\nThe company is in an extractive business; therefore, if it is not successful in replacing the crude oil and natural gas it produces with good prospects for future organic opportunities or through acquisitions, the company’s business will decline. Creating and maintaining an inventory of projects depends on many factors, including obtaining and renewing rights to explore, develop and produce hydrocarbons; drilling success; reservoir optimization; ability to bring long-lead-time, capital-intensive projects to completion on budget and on schedule; and efficient and profitable operation of mature properties.\nThe company’s operations could be disrupted by natural or human causes beyond its control\nChevron operates in both urban areas and remote and sometimes inhospitable regions. The company’s operations are therefore subject to disruption from natural or human causes beyond its control, including risks from hurricanes, severe storms, floods, heat waves, other forms of severe weather, wildfires, ambient temperature increases, sea level rise, war, accidents, civil unrest, political events, fires, earthquakes, system failures, cyber threats, terrorist acts and epidemic or pandemic diseases such as the COVID-19 pandemic, some of which may be impacted by climate change and any of which could result in suspension of operations or harm to people or the natural environment.\nChevron’s risk management systems are designed to assess potential physical and other risks to its operations and assets and to plan for their resiliency. While capital investment reviews and decisions incorporate potential ranges of physical risks such as storm severity and frequency, sea level rise, air and water temperature, precipitation, fresh water access, wind speed, and earthquake severity, among other factors, it is difficult to predict with certainty the timing, frequency or severity of such events, any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company's results of operations or financial condition.\nCyberattacks targeting Chevron’s process control networks or other digital infrastructure could have a material adverse impact on the company’s business and results of operations\nThere are numerous and evolving risks to Chevron’s cybersecurity and privacy from cyber threat actors, including criminal hackers, state-sponsored intrusions, industrial espionage and employee malfeasance. These cyber threat actors, whether internal or external to Chevron, are becoming more sophisticated and coordinated in their attempts to access the company’s information technology (IT) systems and data, including the IT systems of cloud providers and other third parties with whom the company conducts business through, without limitation, malicious software; data privacy breaches by employees, insiders or others with authorized access; cyber or phishing-attacks; ransomware; attempts to gain unauthorized access to our data and systems; and other electronic security breaches. Although Chevron devotes significant resources to prevent unwanted intrusions and to protect its systems and data, whether such data is housed internally or by external third parties, the company has experienced and will continue to experience cyber incidents of varying degrees in the conduct of its business. Cyber threat actors could compromise the company’s process control networks or other critical systems and infrastructure, resulting in disruptions to its business operations, injury to people, harm to the environment or its assets, disruptions in access to its financial reporting systems, or loss, misuse or corruption of its critical data and proprietary information, including without limitation its intellectual property and business information and that of its employees, customers, partners and other third parties. Any of the foregoing can be exacerbated by a delay or failure to detect a cyber incident or the full extent of such incident. Further, the company has exposure to cyber incidents and the negative impacts of such incidents related to its critical data and proprietary information housed on third-party IT systems, including the cloud. Additionally, authorized third-party IT systems or software can be compromised and used to gain access or introduce malware to Chevron's IT systems that can materially impact the company’s business. Regardless of the precise method or form, cyber events could result in significant financial losses, legal or regulatory violations, reputational harm, and legal liability and could ultimately have a material adverse effect on the company’s business and results of operations.\nThe company’s operations have inherent risks and hazards that require significant and continuous oversight\nChevron’s results depend on its ability to identify and mitigate the risks and hazards inherent to operating in the crude oil and natural gas industry. The company seeks to minimize these operational risks by carefully designing and building its facilities and conducting its operations in a safe and reliable manner. However, failure to manage these risks effectively could impair our ability to operate and result in unexpected incidents, including releases, explosions or mechanical failures resulting in personal injury, loss of life, environmental damage, loss of revenues, legal liability and/or disruption to operations. Chevron has implemented and maintains a system of corporate policies, processes and systems, behaviors and compliance\n21\nmechanisms to manage safety, health, environmental, reliability and efficiency risks; to verify compliance with applicable laws and policies; and to respond to and learn from unexpected incidents. In certain situations where Chevron is not the operator, the company may have limited influence and control over third parties, which may limit its ability to manage and control such risks.\nThe company does not insure against all potential losses, which could result in significant financial exposure\nThe company does not have commercial insurance or third-party indemnities to fully cover all operational risks or potential liability in the event of a significant incident or series of incidents causing catastrophic loss. As a result, the company is, to a substantial extent, self-insured for such events. The company relies on existing liquidity, financial resources and borrowing capacity to meet short-term obligations that would arise from such an event or series of events. The occurrence of a significant incident, series of events, or unforeseen liability for which the company is self-insured, not fully insured or for which insurance recovery is significantly delayed could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nLEGAL, REGULATORY AND ESG-RELATED RISK FACTORS\nChevron’s business subjects the company to liability risks from litigation or government action\nThe company produces, transports, refines and markets potentially hazardous materials, and it purchases, handles and disposes of other potentially hazardous materials in the course of its business. Chevron's operations also produce byproducts, which may be considered pollutants. Often these operations are conducted through joint ventures over which the company may have limited influence and control. Any of these activities could result in liability or significant delays in operations arising from private litigation or government action. For example, liability or delays could result from an accidental, unlawful discharge or from new conclusions about the effects of the company’s operations on human health or the environment. In addition, to the extent that societal pressures or political or other factors are involved, it is possible that such liability could be imposed without regard to the company’s causation of or contribution to the asserted damage, or to other mitigating factors.\nFor information concerning some of the litigation in which the company is involved, see\n.\nPolitical instability and significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment could harm Chevron’s business\nThe company’s operations, particularly exploration and production, can be affected by changing political, regulatory and economic environments in the various countries in which it operates. As has occurred in the past, actions could be taken by governments to increase public ownership of the company’s partially or wholly owned businesses, to force contract renegotiations, or to impose additional taxes or royalties. In certain locations, governments have proposed or imposed restrictions on the company’s operations, trade, currency exchange controls, burdensome taxes, and public disclosure requirements that might harm the company’s competitiveness or relations with other governments or third parties. In other countries, political conditions have existed that may threaten the safety of employees and the company’s continued presence in those countries, and internal unrest, acts of violence or strained relations between a government and the company or other governments may adversely affect the company’s operations. Those developments have, at times, significantly affected the company’s operations and results and are carefully considered by management when evaluating the level of current and future activity in such countries. Further, Chevron is required to comply with sanctions and other trade laws and regulations of the United States and other jurisdictions where we operate which, depending upon their scope, could adversely impact the company’s operations and financial results in certain countries.\nIn addition, litigation or changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas, such as those related to the use of hydraulic fracturing or bans on drilling, or any law or regulation that impacts the demand for our products, could adversely affect the company’s current or anticipated future operations and profitability.\nLegislative or regulatory changes in tax laws may expose Chevron to additional tax liabilities\nChanges in tax laws and regulations around the world are regularly enacted due to political or economic factors beyond the company’s control. Chevron’s taxes in the jurisdictions where the company conducts business activities have been and may be adversely affected by changes in tax laws or regulations. Furthermore, Chevron’s tax returns are subject to audit by taxing authorities around the world. There is no assurance that taxing authorities or courts will agree with the positions that Chevron has reflected on the company’s tax returns, in which case interest and penalties could be imposed that may have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nFor information concerning the company’s tax liabilities, see\nand\n.\n22\nLegislation, regulation, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts related to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and climate change could continue to increase Chevron’s operational costs and reduce demand for Chevron’s hydrocarbon and other products, resulting in a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition\nChevron has experienced and may be further challenged by increases in the impacts of international and domestic legislation, regulation, or other government actions relating to GHG emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide and methane) and climate change. International agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to directly or indirectly limit or reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of implementation. The company is currently subject to implemented programs in certain jurisdictions such as the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard program, the European Union Emissions Trading System, and the California cap-and-trade program and low carbon fuel standard obligations. Further, the Paris Agreement went into effect in November 2016, and a number of countries in which we operate may adopt additional policies to meet their Paris Agreement goals. Globally, multiple jurisdictions are considering adopting or are in the process of implementing laws or regulations to directly regulate GHG emissions through similar or other mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, a cap-and-trade program, or performance standards, or to indirectly advance reduction of GHG emissions through restrictive permitting, trade tariffs, minimum renewable usage requirements, increased GHG reporting and climate-related disclosure requirements, or tax advantages or other incentives to promote the use of alternative energy, fuel sources or lower-carbon technologies. GHG emissions that may be directly regulated through such efforts include, among others, those associated with the company’s exploration and production of hydrocarbons; the upgrading of production from oil sands into synthetic oil; power generation; the conversion of crude oil and natural gas into refined hydrocarbon products; the processing, liquefaction, and regasification of natural gas; the transportation of crude oil, natural gas, and related products; and customers’ use of the company’s hydrocarbon products. Indirect regulation of GHG emissions could include, among other things, bans or restrictions on technologies or products that use the company’s hydrocarbon products. Many of these actions, as well as customers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products, and actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations, are beyond the company’s control.\nSimilar to any significant changes in the regulatory environment, GHG emissions and climate change-related legislation, regulation, or other government actions may curtail profitability in the oil and gas sector, or render the extraction of the company’s hydrocarbon resources economically infeasible. In particular, GHG emissions-related legislation, regulations, and other government actions and shifting customer preferences and other private efforts aimed at reducing GHG emissions may result in increased and substantial capital, compliance, operating, and maintenance costs and could, among other things, reduce demand for hydrocarbons and the company’s hydrocarbon-based products; increase demand for lower carbon products and alternative energy sources; make the company’s products more expensive; adversely affect the economic feasibility of the company’s resources; impact or limit our business plans; and adversely affect the company’s sales volumes, revenues, margins and reputation. The ultimate effect of international agreements; national, regional, and state legislation and regulation; and government and private actions related to GHG emissions and climate change on the company’s financial performance, and the timing of these effects, will depend on a number of factors. Such factors include, among others, the sectors covered, the GHG emissions reductions required, the extent to which Chevron would be entitled to receive emission allowance allocations or would need to purchase compliance instruments on the open market or through auctions, the price and availability of emission allowances and credits and the extent to which the company is able to recover the costs incurred through the pricing of the company’s products in the competitive marketplace. Further, the ultimate impact of GHG emissions and climate change-related agreements, legislation, regulation, and government actions on the company’s financial performance is highly uncertain because the company is unable to predict with certainty, for a multitude of individual jurisdictions, the outcome of political decision-making processes, including the actual laws and regulations enacted, the variables and tradeoffs that inevitably occur in connection with such processes, and market conditions.\nIncreasing attention to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) matters may impact our business\nIncreasing attention to ESG matters, including those related to climate change and sustainability, increasing societal, investor and legislative pressure on companies to address ESG matters, and potential customer use of substitutes to Chevron’s products may result in increased costs, reduced demand for our products, reduced profits, increased investigations and litigation or threats thereof, negative impacts on our stock price and access to capital markets, and damage to our reputation. Increasing attention to climate change, for example, may result in demand shifts for our hydrocarbon products and additional governmental investigations and private litigation, or threats thereof, against the company. For instance, we have received investigative requests and demands from the U.S. Congress for information relating to climate change, methane leak\n23\ndetection and repair, and other topics, and further requests and/or demands are possible. At this time, Chevron cannot predict the ultimate impact any Congressional or other investigations may have on the company.\nIn addition, organizations that provide information to investors on corporate governance and related matters have developed ratings processes for evaluating companies on their approach to ESG matters, including climate change and climate-related risks. Such ratings are used by some investors to inform their investment and voting decisions. Also, some stakeholders, including but not limited to sovereign wealth, pension, and endowment funds, have been divesting and promoting divestment of or screening out of fossil fuel equities and urging lenders to limit funding to companies engaged in the extraction of fossil fuel reserves. Unfavorable ESG ratings and investment community divestment initiatives, among other actions, may lead to negative investor sentiment toward Chevron and to the diversion of investment to other industries, which could have a negative impact on our stock price and our access to and costs of capital. Additionally, evolving expectations on various ESG matters, including biodiversity, waste and water, may increase costs, require changes in how we operate and lead to negative stakeholder sentiment.\nOur aspirations, targets and disclosures related to ESG matters expose us to numerous risks, including risks to our reputation and stock price\nIn October 2021, Chevron announced an aspiration to achieve net zero Scope 1 and 2 emissions in Upstream by 2050. The company also has set nearer-term GHG emission-related targets for zero routine flaring, upstream carbon intensity, portfolio carbon intensity, and refining carbon intensity. These aspirations, targets or objectives reflect our current plans and aspirations and are not guarantees that we will be able to achieve them. Our efforts to accomplish and accurately report on these goals and objectives present numerous operational, regulatory, reputational, financial, legal, and other risks, any of which could have a material negative impact, including on our reputation and stock price.\nOur ability to achieve any aspiration, target or objective, including with respect to climate-related initiatives, our new lower carbon strategy outlined in the Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, pages 32 through 34, and any lower carbon new energy businesses, is subject to numerous risks, many of which are outside of our control. Examples of such risks include: (1) the continuing progress of commercially viable technologies and low- or non-carbon-based energy sources; (2) the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities; (3) the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits; (4) the availability of suppliers that can meet our sustainability and other standards; (5) evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or disclosures; (6) evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals; (7) customers’ preferences and use of the company’s products or substitute products; and (8) actions taken by the company’s competitors in response to legislation and regulations.\nThe standards for tracking and reporting on ESG matters are relatively new, have not been harmonized and continue to evolve. Our selection of disclosure frameworks that seek to align with various voluntary reporting standards may change from time to time and may result in a lack of comparative data from period to period. In addition, our processes and controls may not always align with evolving voluntary standards for identifying, measuring, and reporting ESG metrics, our interpretation of reporting standards may differ from those of others, and such standards may change over time, any of which could result in significant revisions to our goals or reported progress in achieving such goals.\nAchievement of or efforts to achieve aspirations and targets such as the foregoing and future internal climate-related initiatives may increase costs, require purchase of carbon credits, or limit or impact the company’s business plans and financial results, potentially resulting in the reduction to the economic end-of-life of certain assets, an impairment of the associated net book value, among other material adverse impacts. Our failure or perceived failure to pursue or fulfill such aspirations and targets or to satisfy various reporting standards within the timelines we announce, or at all, could have a negative impact on investor sentiment, ratings outcomes for evaluating the company’s approach to ESG matters, stock price, and cost of capital and expose us to government enforcement actions and private litigation, among other material adverse impacts.\nGENERAL RISK FACTORS\nChanges in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period\nIn preparing the company’s periodic reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, including its financial statements, Chevron’s management is required under applicable rules and regulations to make estimates and assumptions as of a specified date. These estimates and assumptions are based on management’s best estimates and experience as of that date and are subject to substantial risk and uncertainty. Materially different results may occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\n24\nAreas requiring significant estimates and assumptions by management include impairments to property, plant and equipment and investments in affiliates; estimates of crude oil and natural gas recoverable reserves; accruals for estimated liabilities, including litigation reserves; and measurement of benefit obligations for pension and other postretirement benefit plans. Changes in estimates or assumptions or the information underlying the assumptions, such as changes in the company’s business plans, general market conditions, the pace of energy transition, or changes in the company’s outlook on commodity prices, could affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities or expenses."

Earnings of the company depend mostly on the profitability of its upstream business segment. The most significant factor affecting the results of operations for the upstream segment is the price of crude oil, which is determined in global markets outside of the company’s control. In the company’s downstream business, crude oil is the largest cost component of refined products. Periods of sustained lower commodity prices could result in the impairment or write-off of specific assets in future periods and cause the company to adjust operating expenses, including employee reductions, and capital and exploratory expenditures, along with other measures intended to improve financial performance.\nGovernments, companies, communities, and other stakeholders are increasingly supporting efforts to address climate change, recognizing that individuals and society benefit from access to affordable, reliable, and ever-cleaner energy. International initiatives and national, regional and state legislation and regulations that aim to directly or indirectly reduce GHG emissions are in various stages of adoption and implementation. These policies, some of which support the global net zero emissions ambitions of the Paris Agreement, can change the amount of energy consumed, the rate of energy-demand growth, the energy mix, and the relative economics of one fuel versus another. Implementation of these policies can be dependent on, and can affect the pace of, technological advancements, the granting of necessary permits by governing authorities, the availability of cost-effective, verifiable carbon credits, the availability of suppliers that can meet sustainability and other standards, evolving regulatory requirements affecting ESG standards or other disclosures, and evolving standards for tracking and reporting on emissions and emission reductions and removals. Beyond the legislative and regulatory landscape, ever changing customer and consumer behavior can also influence energy demand by affecting preferences and use of the company’s products or competitors’ products, now and in the future.\n32\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nChevron supports the Paris Agreement’s global approach to governments addressing climate change and is committed to taking actions to help lower the carbon intensity of its operations while continuing to meet the need for energy that supports society. Chevron integrates climate change-related issues and the regulatory and other responses to these issues into its strategy and planning, capital investment reviews, and risk management tools and processes, where it believes they are applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand, and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect estimates of long-range effects from climate change-related policy actions, such as renewable fuel penetration and energy efficiency standards, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. The actual level of expenditure required to comply with new or potential climate change-related laws and regulations and amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities, such as carbon capture and storage, is difficult to predict with certainty and is expected to vary depending on the actual laws and regulations enacted or customer and consumer preference in a jurisdiction, the company’s activities in it, and market conditions. As discussed in more detail below, the company has announced planned capital spend of $10 billion through 2028 in lower carbon investments.\nAlthough the future is uncertain, many published outlooks conclude that fossil fuels will remain a significant part of an energy system that increasingly incorporates lower carbon sources of supply. The company will continue to develop oil and gas resources to meet customers’ demand for energy. At the same time, Chevron believes that the future of energy is lower carbon. The company will continue to maintain flexibility in its portfolio to be responsive to changes in policy, technology, and customer preferences. Chevron aims to grow its traditional oil and gas business, lower the carbon intensity of its operations and grow lower carbon businesses in renewable fuels, hydrogen, carbon capture and offsets. To grow its lower carbon businesses, Chevron plans to target sectors of the economy where emissions are harder to abate or that cannot be easily electrified, while leveraging the company’s capabilities, assets and customer relationships. The company’s traditional oil and gas business may increase or decrease depending upon regulatory or market forces, among other factors.\nIn 2021, Chevron announced the following aspiration and targets that are aligned with its lower carbon strategy:\n2050 Net Zero Upstream Aspiration\nChevron aspires to achieve net zero for Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 GHG Emissions on an equity basis by 2050.\nThe company believes accomplishing this aspiration depends on, among other things, partnerships with multiple stakeholders, continuing progress on commercially viable technology, government policy, successful negotiations for carbon capture and storage and nature-based projects, availability of cost-effective, verifiable offsets in the global market, and granting of necessary permits by governing authorities.\n2028 Upstream Production GHG Intensity Targets\nThese metrics include Scope 1, direct emissions, and Scope 2, indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam, and are net of emissions from exported electricity and steam. The targeted 2028 reductions from 2016 on an equity ownership basis include a:\n•\n40 percent reduction in oil production GHG intensity to 24 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalent per barrel of oil-equivalent (CO\n2\ne/boe),\n•\n26 percent reduction in gas production GHG intensity to 24 kg CO\n2\ne/boe,\n•\n53 percent reduction in methane intensity to 2 kg CO\n2\ne/boe, and\n•\n66 percent reduction in flaring GHG intensity to 3 kg CO\n2\ne/boe.\nThe company also targets no routine flaring by 2030. We have set 2016 as our baseline to align with the year the Paris Agreement entered into force, and the company plans to update the metrics every five years in line with the Paris Agreement stocktakes. We believe these updates will provide additional transparency on the company’s progress toward its net zero aspiration.\n2028 Portfolio Carbon Intensity Target\nThe company also introduced a portfolio carbon intensity (PCI) metric, which is a measure of the carbon intensity across the full value chain of Chevron’s entire business. This metric encompasses the company’s Upstream and Downstream business and includes Scope 1 (direct emissions), Scope 2 (indirect emissions from imported electricity and steam), and certain Scope 3 (primarily emissions from use of sold products) emissions. The company’s PCI target is 71 grams (g) carbon dioxide equivalent (CO e) per megajoules (MJ) by 2028, a greater than five percent reduction from 2016.\nPlanned Lower-Carbon Capital Spend through 2028\nThe company increased its planned capital spend to approximately $10 billion through 2028 to advance its lower carbon strategy, which includes approximately $2 billion to lower the carbon intensity of its traditional oil and gas operations, and approximately $8 billion for lower carbon investments in renewable fuels, hydrogen and carbon capture and offsets. We anticipate setting additional capital spending targets as the company\n33\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nprogresses toward its 2050 Upstream production Scope 1 and 2 net zero aspiration and further grows its lower carbon business lines.\nRefer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 25 for further discussion of greenhouse gas regulation and climate change and the associated risks to Chevron’s business, including the risks impacting Chevron’s lower carbon strategy and its aspirations, targets and plans.\nResponse to Market Conditions and COVID-19\nCommodity prices and demand for most of our products  have largely recovered from the impacts of COVID-19 in 2020. However, some countries face a resurgence of the virus and its variants (e.g., Delta, Omicron) that could impact demand for some of our products (e.g., jet fuel), workforce availability, timing of project start-ups and materials movement and pose a risk to our business and future financial results.\nChevron’s operations have continued with a combination of on-site and at-home work, while monitoring local vaccine and transmission rates. In refining, the company continued to take steps to maximize diesel and motor gasoline production, given the decline in jet fuel demand.\nIn TCO, progress continued on FGP/WPMP. Staffing is at targeted levels and at the end of December 2021, over 90 percent of the TCO workforce on-site was fully vaccinated.\nThe effective tax rate for the company can change substantially during periods of significant earnings volatility. This is mainly due to mix effects that are impacted both by the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arise in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions. As a result, a decline or increase in the effective income tax rate in one period may not be indicative of expected results in future periods.\nprovides the company’s effective income tax rate for the last three years.\nRefer to the “Cautionary Statements Relevant to Forward-Looking Information” on page 2 and to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 25 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nThe company continually evaluates opportunities to dispose of assets that are not expected to provide sufficient long-term value and to acquire assets or operations complementary to its asset base to help augment the company’s financial performance and value growth. Asset dispositions and restructurings may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.\nThe company closely monitors developments in the financial and credit markets, the level of worldwide economic activity, and the implications for the company of movements in prices for crude oil and natural gas. Management takes these developments into account in the conduct of daily operations and for business planning.\nComments related to earnings trends for the company’s major business areas are as follows:\nUpstream\nEarnings for the upstream segment are closely aligned with industry prices for crude oil and natural gas. Crude oil and natural gas prices are subject to external factors over which the company has no control, including product demand connected with global economic conditions, industry production and inventory levels, technology advancements, production quotas or other actions imposed by OPEC+ countries, actions of regulators, weather-related damage and disruptions, competing fuel prices, natural and human causes beyond the company’s control such as the COVID-19 pandemic, and regional supply interruptions or fears thereof that may be caused by military conflicts, civil unrest or political uncertainty. Any of these factors could also inhibit the company’s production capacity in an affected region. The company closely monitors developments in the countries in which it operates and holds investments and seeks to manage risks in operating its facilities and businesses.\nThe longer-term trend in earnings for the upstream segment is also a function of other factors, including the company’s ability to find or acquire and efficiently produce crude oil and natural gas, changes in fiscal terms of contracts, the pace of energy transition, and changes in tax, environmental and other applicable laws and regulations.\nThe company is actively managing its schedule of work, contracting, procurement, and supply chain activities to effectively manage costs and ensure supply chain resiliency and continuity in support of operational goals. Third party costs for capital, exploration, and operating expenses can be subject to external factors beyond the company’s control including, but not limited to: severe weather or civil unrest, delays in construction, global and local supply chain distribution issues, the general level of inflation, tariffs or other taxes imposed on goods or services, and market based prices charged by the industry’s material and service providers. Chevron utilizes contracts with various pricing mechanisms, so there may be a lag before the company’s costs reflect changes in market trends.\n34\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nPrices for goods and services in various sectors have risen over the past year. A key factor behind this trend is the accelerated demand for goods and transportation as companies restock materials and expand working inventories as a hedge against future disruptions. Shifts in the labor market continue to create issues for companies seeking to fill positions. Geographic mismatches between skills required and available labor, reductions in the overall labor supply, and perceptions of working conditions have resulted in tight labor markets.\nAs U.S. and international drilling activity continues to accelerate, continued upward market pressure is expected for oil and gas industry inputs (such as rigs and well services). The pace of economic growth and shifting spending patterns may lead to more cross-industry competition for resources, which could impact the cost of certain non-oil and gas industry goods and services.\nThe chart above shows the trend in benchmark prices for Brent crude oil, West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil and U.S. Henry Hub natural gas. The Brent price averaged $71 per barrel for the full-year 2021, compared to $42 in 2020. As of mid-February 2022, the Brent price was $100 per barrel. The WTI price averaged $68 per barrel for the full-year 2021, compared to $39 in 2020. As of mid-February 2022, the WTI price was $95 per barrel. The majority of the company’s equity crude production is priced based on the Brent benchmark.\nCrude prices increased in 2021 driven by production curtailment by OPEC+ countries and steadily increasing demand for transportation fuels. The company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $56 per barrel, up 84 percent from 2020. The company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $65 per barrel, up 79 percent from 2020.\nPrices for natural gas are more closely aligned with seasonal supply-and-demand and infrastructure conditions in local markets. In the United States, prices at Henry Hub averaged $3.85 per thousand cubic feet (MCF) during 2021, compared with $1.98 per MCF during 2020. As of mid-February 2022, the Henry Hub spot price was $3.93 per MCF.\nOutside the United States, prices for natural gas depend on a wide range of supply, demand and regulatory circumstances. The company’s long-term contract prices for liquefied natural gas (LNG) are typically linked to crude oil prices. Most of the equity LNG offtake from the operated Australian LNG projects is committed under binding long-term contracts, with some sold in the Asian spot LNG market. International natural gas realizations averaged $5.93 per MCF during 2021, compared with $4.59 per MCF during 2020. (See page 42 for the company’s average natural gas realizations for the U.S. and international regions.)\nThe company’s worldwide net oil-equivalent production in 2021 was a record 3.099 million barrels per day. About 27 percent of the company’s net oil-equivalent production in 2021 occurred in OPEC+ member countries of Angola, Equatorial Guinea, Kazakhstan, Nigeria, the Partitioned Zone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Republic of Congo.\nThe company estimates that its net oil-equivalent production in 2022 will be flat to down 3 percent compared to 2021, assuming a Brent crude oil price of $60 per barrel and excluding the impact of asset sales that may close in 2022. This estimate is subject to many factors and uncertainties, including quotas or other actions that may be imposed by OPEC+; price effects on entitlement volumes; changes in fiscal terms or restrictions on the scope of company operations; delays in construction; reservoir performance; greater-than-expected declines in production from mature fields; start-up or ramp-up of projects; fluctuations in demand for crude oil and natural gas in various markets; weather conditions that may shut in\n35\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nproduction; civil unrest; changing geopolitics; delays in completion of maintenance turnarounds; storage constraints or economic conditions that could lead to shut-in production; or other disruptions to operations. The outlook for future production levels is also affected by the size and number of economic investment opportunities and the time lag between initial exploration and the beginning of production. The company has increased its investment emphasis on short-cycle projects.\nIn January 2022, Chevron announced its intent to begin the process of exiting from its nonoperated interests in Myanmar. At December 31, 2021, the carrying value of the company’s assets was approximately $200 million.\nNet proved reserves for consolidated companies and affiliated companies totaled 11.3 billion barrels of oil-equivalent at year-end 2021, an increase of 1 percent from year-end 2020. The reserve replacement ratio in 2021 was 112 percent. The 5 and 10 year reserve replacement ratios were 103 percent and 100 percent, respectively. Refer to\nfor a tabulation of the company’s proved net oil and gas reserves by geographic area, at the beginning of 2019 and each year-end from 2019 through 2021, and an accompanying discussion of major changes to proved reserves by geographic area for the three-year period ending December 31, 2021.\nRefer to the “Results of Operations” section on pages 39 and 40 for additional discussion of the company’s upstream business.\nDownstream\nEarnings for the downstream segment are closely tied to margins on the refining, manufacturing and marketing of products that include gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, lubricants, fuel oil, fuel and lubricant additives, petrochemicals and renewable fuels. Industry margins are sometimes volatile and can be affected by the global and regional supply-and-demand balance for refined products and petrochemicals, and by changes in the price of crude oil, other refinery and petrochemical feedstocks, and natural gas. Industry margins can also be influenced by inventory levels, geopolitical events, costs of materials and services, refinery or chemical plant capacity utilization, maintenance programs, and disruptions at refineries or chemical plants resulting from unplanned outages due to severe weather, fires or other operational events.\nOther factors affecting profitability for downstream operations include the reliability and efficiency of the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, the effectiveness of its crude oil and product supply functions, and the volatility of tanker-charter rates for the company’s shipping operations, which are driven by the industry’s demand for crude oil and product tankers. Other factors beyond the company’s control include the general level of inflation and energy costs to operate the company’s refining, marketing and petrochemical assets, and changes in tax, environmental, and other applicable laws and regulations.\nThe company’s most significant marketing areas are the West Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States and Asia Pacific. Chevron operates or has significant ownership interests in refineries in each of these areas. Additionally, the company has a small but growing presence in renewable fuels.\n36\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nRefer to the “Results of Operations” section on page 40 for additional discussion of the company’s downstream operations.\nAll Other\nconsists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.\nOperating Developments\nKey operating developments and other events during 2021 and early 2022 included the following:\nUpstream\nAngola\nChevron’s affiliate, Cabinda Gulf Oil Company Limited (CABGOC), signed an agreement to extend the Block 0 concession for 20 years, through 2050.\nAustralia\nSanctioned the Jansz-Io compression project, a part of the Gorgon development and an important source of natural gas supply to the Gorgon LNG facility.\nBrazil\nCompleted the sale of the company's 37.5 percent nonoperated interest in the Papa-Terra oil field.\nEquatorial Guinea\nAnnounced the start-up and first LNG cargo from the Alen Gas Monetization Project.\nJapan\nAnnounced the signing of a binding Sale and Purchase Agreement with Hokkaido Gas Co., Ltd. for the delivery of about a half million tons of LNG over a period of five years, starting in 2022.\nUnited States\nEntered FEED for the Ballymore project, which is being developed as a subsea tieback to the existing Blind Faith facility, in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\nUnited States\nSanctioned the Whale project in the deepwater Gulf of Mexico.\nDownstream\nFinland\nAnnounced an agreement to acquire Neste Oyj’s Group III base oil business, including its related sales and marketing business, and brand NEXBASE\nTM\n.\nSouth Korea\nChevron’s 50 percent owned affiliate, GS Caltex, started up an olefins mixed-feed cracker and associated polyethylene unit at its Yeosu refinery ahead of schedule and under budget.\nUnited States\nAnnounced the commissioning and start-up of the world’s first commercial-scale ISOALKY™ process unit at the Salt Lake City Refinery.

Refer to\nfor a discussion of the company’s “reportable segments.” This section should also be read in conjunction with the discussion in “Business Environment and Outlook” on pages 32 through 37. Refer to the “Selected Operating Data” table on page 42 for a three-year comparison of production volumes, refined product sales volumes, and refinery inputs. A discussion of variances between 2020 and 2019 can be found in the “Results of Operations” section on pages 37 through 38 of the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the SEC on February 25, 2021.\n38\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nU.S. Upstream\nU.S. upstream reported earnings of $7.3 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $1.6 billion in 2020. The increase was due to higher realizations of $6.9 billion, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $1.2 billion, higher sales volumes of $760 million, and higher asset sales gains of $640 million.\nThe company’s average realization for U.S. crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $56.06 per barrel compared with $30.53 in 2020. The average natural gas realization was $3.11 per thousand cubic feet in 2021, compared with $0.98 in 2020.\nNet oil-equivalent production in 2021 averaged 1.14 million barrels per day, up 8 percent from 2020. The increase was due to an additional 162,000 barrels per day of production from the Noble Energy acquisition, partially offset by a 63,000 barrels per day decrease related to the Appalachian asset sale.\nThe net liquids component of oil-equivalent production for 2021 averaged 858,000 barrels per day, up 9 percent from 2020. Net natural gas production averaged 1.69 billion cubic feet per day in 2021, an increase of 5 percent from 2020.\nInternational Upstream\nInternational upstream reported earnings of $8.5 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $825 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher realizations of $7.6 billion, along with the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs of $3.6 billion and severance charges of $290 million. Partially offsetting these increases are higher tax charges of $630 million, the absence of 2020 asset sales gains of $550 million, and higher depreciation expenses of $670 million and lower sales volumes of $540 million. Foreign currency effects had a favorable impact on earnings of $587 million between periods.\nThe company’s average realization for international crude oil and natural gas liquids in 2021 was $64.53 per barrel compared with $36.07 in 2020. The average natural gas realization was $5.93 per thousand cubic feet in 2021 compared with $4.59 in 2020.\nInternational net oil-equivalent production was 1.96 million barrels per day in 2021, down 3 percent from 2020. The decrease was primarily due to the absence of 69,000 barrels per day following expiration of the Rokan concession in\n39\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIndonesia, unfavorable entitlement effects, normal field declines and the effect of asset sales, partially offset by 113,000 barrels per day associated with the Noble Energy acquisition and lower production curtailments.\nThe net liquids component of international oil-equivalent production was 956,000 barrels per day in 2021, a decrease of 11 percent from 2020. International net natural gas production of 6.02 billion cubic feet per day in 2021 increased 6 percent from 2020.\nU.S. Downstream\nU.S. downstream reported earnings of $2.4 billion in 2021, compared with a loss of $571 million in 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher margins on refined product sales of $1.6 billion, higher earnings from 50 percent-owned CPChem of $1.0 billion and higher sales volumes of $470 million, partially offset by higher operating expenses of $150 million.\nTotal refined product sales of 1.14 million barrels per day in 2021 increased 14 percent from 2020, mainly due to higher gasoline, jet fuel, and diesel demand as travel restrictions associated with the COVID-19 pandemic continue to ease.\nInternational Downstream\nInternational downstream earned $525 million in 2021, compared with $618 million in 2020. The decrease in earnings was largely due to lower margins on refined product sales of $330 million and higher operating expenses of $100 million, partially offset by a favorable swing in foreign currency effects of $337 million between periods.\nTotal refined product sales of 1.32 million barrels per day in 2021 were up 8 percent from 2020, mainly due to the second quarter 2020 acquisition of Puma Energy (Australia) Holdings Pty Ltd. and higher diesel and gasoline demand, partially offset by lower jet fuel demand.\nAll Other\nAll Other consists of worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology companies.\nNet charges in 2021 decreased $50 million from 2020. The change between periods was mainly due to the absence of 2020 severance, Noble acquisition and mining remediation costs, and lower corporate charges, partially offset by higher employee benefit costs and a loss on early retirement of debt. Foreign currency effects decreased net charges by $27 million between periods.\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nComparative amounts for certain income statement categories are shown below. A discussion of variances between 2020 and 2019 can be found in the “Consolidated Statement of Income” section on pages 39 and 40 of the company’s 2020 Annual Report on Form 10-K.\nSales and other operating revenues increased in 2021\nmainly due to higher refined product, crude oil, and natural gas prices and sales volumes\n.\n40\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nIncome from equity affiliates improved in 2021 mainly due to the absence of the full impairment of Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela in 2020, higher upstream-related earnings from Tengizchevroil in Kazakhstan and Angola LNG, and higher downstream-related earnings from CPChem and GS Caltex in Korea.\nRefer to\nfor a discussion of Chevron’s investments in affiliated companies.\nOther income increased in 2021 mainly due to a favorable swing in foreign currency effects and higher gains on asset sales, partially offset by losses on the early retirement of debt.\nCrude oil and product purchases increased in 2021 primarily due to higher crude oil, natural gas, and refined product prices and higher refined product volumes.\nOperating, selling, general and administrative expenses increased in 2021 primarily due to higher employee benefit and transportation costs partially offset by the absence of 2020 severance accruals.\nExploration expenses in 2021 decreased primarily\ndue to lower charges for well write-offs\n.\nDepreciation, depletion and amortization expenses decreased in 2021 primarily\ndue to lower impairment charges, partially offset by higher rates and production\n.\nTaxes other than on income increased in 2021 primarily\ndue to higher regulatory expenses, taxes on production and excise taxes, which was primarily driven by higher refined product sales in Australia.\nInterest and debt expenses increased in 2021 mainly due to interest expense associated with debt acquired in the Noble Energy acquisition.\nOther components of net periodic benefit costs decreased in 2021 primarily due to lower interest costs.\nThe increase in income tax expense in 2021 of $7.84 billion is due to the increase in total income before tax for the company of $29.09 billion. The increase in income before taxes for the company is primarily the result of higher upstream realizations, the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs, and higher downstream margins.\nU.S. income before tax increased from a loss of $5.70 billion in 2020 to income of $9.67 billion in 2021. This $15.37 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations, higher downstream margins and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs. The increase in income had a direct impact on the company’s U.S. income tax resulting in an increase to tax expense of $3.18 billion between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $1.58 billion in 2020 to a charge of $1.60 billion in 2021.\n41\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nInternational income before tax increased from a loss of $1.75 billion in 2020 to income of $11.97 billion in 2021. This $13.72 billion increase in income was primarily driven by higher upstream realizations and the absence of 2020 impairments and write-offs. The increased income primarily drove the $4.66 billion increase in international income tax expense between year-over-year periods, from a tax benefit of $308 million in 2020 to a charge of $4.35 billion in 2021.\nRefer also to the discussion of the effective income tax rate in\n.\nSelected Operating Data\n1,2\n42\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nSources and Uses of Cash\nThe strength of the company’s balance sheet enables it to fund any timing differences throughout the year between cash inflows and outflows.\nCash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities\nTotal balances were $5.7 billion and $5.6 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Cash provided by operating activities in 2021 was $29.2 billion, compared to $10.6 billion in 2020, primarily due to higher crude oil and natural gas prices. Cash provided by operating activities was net of contributions to employee pension plans of approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $1.2 billion in 2020. Cash provided by investing activities included proceeds and deposits related to asset sales of $1.4 billion in 2021 and $2.9 billion in 2020.\nRestricted cash of $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, was held in cash and short-term marketable securities and recorded as “Deferred charges and other assets” and “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These amounts are generally associated with upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and funds held in escrow for tax-deferred exchanges.\nDividends\nDividends paid to common stockholders were $10.2 billion in 2021 and $9.7 billion in 2020.\nDebt and Finance Lease Liabilities\nTotal debt and finance lease liabilities were $31.4 billion at December 31, 2021, down from $44.3 billion at year-end 2020.\nThe $12.9 billion decrease in total debt and finance lease liabilities during 2021 was primarily due to the repayment of long-term notes that matured during the year, the early retirement of long-term notes and the credit facility held by Noble Midstream Partners LP, and the elimination of borrowings under the company’s commercial paper program. The company completed a tender offer, with the objective of lowering future interest expenses, and redeemed bonds with a book value (including fair market price adjustments) of $3.4 billion in October 2021. The company’s debt and finance lease liabilities due within one year, consisting primarily of the current portion of long-term debt and redeemable long-term obligations, totaled $8.0 billion at December 31, 2021, compared with $11.4 billion at year-end 2020. Of these amounts, $7.8 billion and $9.8 billion were reclassified to long-term debt at the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAt year-end 2021, settlement of these obligations was not expected to require the use of working capital in 2022, as the company had the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.\nThe company has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023 for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.\nThe major debt rating agencies routinely evaluate the company’s debt, and the company’s cost of borrowing can increase or decrease depending on these debt ratings. The company has outstanding public bonds issued by Chevron Corporation,\n43\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCUSA, Noble, and Texaco Capital Inc. Most of these securities are the obligations of, or guaranteed by, Chevron Corporation and are rated AA- by Standard and Poor’s Corporation and Aa2 by Moody’s Investors Service. The company’s U.S. commercial paper is rated A-1+ by Standard and Poor’s and P-1 by Moody’s. All of these ratings denote high-quality, investment-grade securities.\nThe company’s future debt level is dependent primarily on results of operations, cash that may be generated from asset dispositions, the capital program, lending commitments to affiliates and shareholder distributions. Based on its high-quality debt ratings, the company believes that it has substantial borrowing capacity to meet unanticipated cash requirements. During extended periods of low prices for crude oil and natural gas and narrow margins for refined products and commodity chemicals, the company has the ability to modify its capital spending plans and discontinue or curtail the stock repurchase program. This provides the flexibility to continue paying the common stock dividend and remain committed to retaining the company’s high-quality debt ratings.\nCommitted Credit Facilities\nInformation related to committed credit facilities is included in\n.\nSummarized Financial Information for Guarantee of Securities of Subsidiaries\nCUSA issued bonds that are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on an unsecured basis by Chevron Corporation (together, the “Obligor Group”). The tables below contain summary financial information for Chevron Corporation, as Guarantor, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries, and CUSA, as the issuer, excluding its consolidated subsidiaries. The summary financial information of the Obligor Group is presented on a combined basis, and transactions between the combined entities have been eliminated. Financial information for non-guarantor entities has been excluded.\nCommon Stock Repurchase Program\nThe Board of Directors authorized a stock repurchase program in 2019, with a maximum dollar limit of $25 billion and no set term limits. During 2021, the company purchased 12.9 million shares for $1.4 billion under the program. As of December 31, 2021, the company had purchased a total of 61.5 million shares for $6.8 billion, resulting in $18.2 billion remaining under the program. The company currently expects to repurchase $1.25 billion of its common stock during the first quarter of 2022.\nRepurchases may be made from time to time in the open market, by block purchases, in privately negotiated transactions, or in such other manner as determined by the company. The timing of the repurchases and the actual amount repurchased will depend on a variety of factors, including the market price of the company’s shares, general market and economic conditions, and other factors. The stock repurchase program does not obligate the company to acquire any particular amount of common stock, and it may be suspended or discontinued at any time.\n44\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nCapital and Exploratory Expenditures\nCapital and exploratory expenditures by business segment for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are as follows:\nTotal reported expenditures for 2021 were $11.7 billion, including $3.2 billion for the company’s share of equity-affiliate expenditures, which did not require cash outlays by the company. In 2020, expenditures were $13.5 billion, including the company’s share of affiliates’ expenditures of $4.0 billion. The acquisition of Noble is not included in the company’s capital and exploratory expenditures.\nOf the $11.7 billion of expenditures in 2021, 82 percent, or $9.6 billion, related to upstream activities. Approximately 81 percent was expended for upstream operations in 2020. International upstream accounted for 51 percent of the worldwide upstream investment in 2021 and 53 percent in 2020.\nThe company estimates that 2022 organic capital and exploratory expenditures will be approximately $15 billion, including $3.6 billion of spending by affiliates, an increase of over 25 percent from 2021 expenditures. This includes approximately $800 million in lower carbon spending that aims to reduce the carbon intensity of the company’s operations and grow its lower carbon businesses.\nIn the upstream business, approximately $8 billion is allocated to currently producing assets, including about $3 billion for Permian Basin unconventional development and approximately $1.5 billion for other shale and tight assets worldwide. Additionally, $3 billion of the upstream program is planned for major capital projects underway, of which about $2 billion is associated with the FGP/WPMP at the Tengiz field in Kazakhstan. Finally, approximately $1.5 billion is allocated to exploration, early-stage development projects, midstream activities and carbon reduction opportunities.\nWorldwide downstream spending in 2022 is estimated to be $2.3 billion, including capital targeted to grow renewable fuels and products businesses. Investments in technology businesses and other corporate operations in 2022 are budgeted at $0.4 billion.\nThe company monitors crude oil market conditions and can adjust future capital outlays should oil price conditions deteriorate.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nThe company had noncontrolling interests of $873 million at December 31, 2021 and $1.0 billion at December 31, 2020. Distributions to noncontrolling interests net of contributions totaled $36 million and $24 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Included within noncontrolling interests at December 31, 2021 is $135 million of redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nPension Obligations\nInformation related to pension plan contributions is included in\n, under the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”\nContractual Obligations\nInformation related to the company’s significant contractual obligations is included in\n, in\nand in\n. The aggregate amount of interest due on these obligations, excluding leases, is: 2022 – $683; 2023 – $533; 2024 – $447; 2025 – $388; 2026 – $305; after 2026 – $3,143.\nLong-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements\nInformation related to these off-balance sheet matters is included in\n, under the heading “Long-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements.”\nDirect Guarantees\nInformation related to guarantees is included in\nunder the heading “Guarantees.”\nIndemnifications\nInformation related to indemnifications is included in\nunder the heading “Indemnifications.”\n45\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nFinancial Ratios and Metrics\nThe following represent several metrics the company believes are useful measures to monitor the financial health of the company and its performance over time:\nCurrent Ratio\nCurrent assets divided by current liabilities, which indicates the company’s ability to repay its short-term liabilities with short-term assets. The current ratio in all periods was adversely affected by the fact that Chevron’s inventories are valued on a last-in, first-out basis. At year-end 2021, the book value of inventory was lower than replacement costs, based on average acquisition costs during the year, by approximately $5.6 billion.\nInterest Coverage Ratio\nIncome before income tax expense, plus interest and debt expense and amortization of capitalized interest, less net income attributable to noncontrolling interests, divided by before-tax interest costs. This ratio indicates the company’s ability to pay interest on outstanding debt. The company’s interest coverage ratio in 2021 was higher than 2020 due to higher income.\nFree Cash Flow\nThe cash provided by operating activities less cash capital expenditures, which represents the cash available to creditors and investors after investing in the business.\nDebt Ratio\nTotal debt as a percentage of total debt plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage.\n46\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nNet Debt Ratio\nTotal debt less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities as a percentage of total debt less cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities, plus Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, which indicates the company’s leverage, net of its cash balances.\nCapital Employed\nThe sum of Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity, total debt and noncontrolling interests, which represents the net investment in the business.\nReturn on Average Capital Employed (ROCE)\nNet income attributable to Chevron (adjusted for after-tax interest expense and noncontrolling interest) divided by average capital employed. Average capital employed is computed by averaging the sum of capital employed at the beginning and end of the year. ROCE is a ratio intended to measure annual earnings as a percentage of historical investments in the business.\nReturn on Stockholders\n’\nEquity (ROSE)\nNet income attributable to Chevron divided by average Chevron Corporation Stockholders’ Equity. Average stockholders’ equity is computed by averaging the sum of stockholders’ equity at the beginning and end of the year. ROSE is a ratio intended to measure earnings as a percentage of shareholder investments.\nFinancial and Derivative Instrument Market Risk\nThe market risk associated with the company’s portfolio of financial and derivative instruments is discussed below. The estimates of financial exposure to market risk do not represent the company’s projection of future market changes. The actual impact of future market changes could differ materially due to factors discussed elsewhere in this report, including those set forth under the heading “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A.\n47\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nDerivative Commodity Instruments\nChevron is exposed to market risks related to the price volatility of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and refinery feedstocks. The company uses derivative commodity instruments to manage these exposures on a portion of its activity, including firm commitments and anticipated transactions for the purchase, sale and storage of crude oil, refined products, natural gas, natural gas liquids, liquefied natural gas and feedstock for company refineries. The company also uses derivative commodity instruments for limited trading purposes. The results of these activities were not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or cash flows in 2021.\nThe company’s market exposure positions are monitored on a daily basis by an internal Risk Control group in accordance with the company’s risk management policies. The company’s risk management practices and its compliance with policies are reviewed by the Audit Committee of the company’s Board of Directors.\nDerivatives beyond those designated as normal purchase and normal sale contracts are recorded at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Fair values are derived principally from published market quotes and other independent third-party quotes. The change in fair value of Chevron’s derivative commodity instruments in 2021 was not material to the company’s results of operations.\nThe company uses the Monte Carlo simulation method as its Value-at-Risk (VaR) model to estimate the maximum potential loss in fair value, at the 95 percent confidence level with a one-day holding period, from the effect of adverse changes in market conditions on derivative commodity instruments held or issued. Based on these inputs, the VaR for the company’s primary risk exposures in the area of derivative commodity instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020 was not material to the company’s cash flows or results of operations.\nForeign Currency\nThe company may enter into foreign currency derivative contracts to manage some of its foreign currency exposures. These exposures include revenue and anticipated purchase transactions, including foreign currency capital expenditures and lease commitments. The foreign currency derivative contracts, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. There were no material open foreign currency derivative contracts at December 31, 2021.\nInterest Rates\nThe company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. At year-end 2021, the company had no interest rate swaps.\nTransactions With Related Parties\nChevron enters into a number of business arrangements with related parties, principally its equity affiliates. These arrangements include long-term supply or offtake agreements and long-term purchase agreements. Refer to “Other Information” in\nfor further discussion. Management believes these agreements have been negotiated on terms consistent with those that would have been negotiated with an unrelated party.\nLitigation and Other Contingencies\nEcuador\nInformation related to Ecuador matters is included in\nunder the heading “Ecuador.”\nClimate Change\nInformation related to climate change-related matters is included in\nunder the heading “Climate Change.”\nLouisiana\nInformation related to Louisiana coastal matters is included in\nunder the heading “Louisiana.”\nEnvironmental\nThe following table displays the annual changes to the company’s before-tax environmental remediation reserves, including those for U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws.\n48\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThe company records asset retirement obligations when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of long-lived assets and the liability can be reasonably estimated. These asset retirement obligations include costs related to environmental issues. The liability balance of approximately $12.8 billion for asset retirement obligations at year-end 2021 is related primarily to upstream properties.\nFor the company’s other ongoing operating assets, such as refineries and chemicals facilities, no provisions are made for exit or cleanup costs that may be required when such assets reach the end of their useful lives unless a decision to sell or otherwise decommission the facility has been made, as the indeterminate settlement dates for the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the asset retirement obligation.\nRefer to the discussion below for additional information on environmental matters and their impact on Chevron, and on the company’s 2021 environmental expenditures. Refer to\nunder the heading “Environmental” for additional discussion of environmental remediation provisions and year-end reserves. Refer also to\nfor additional discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.\nSuspended Wells\nInformation related to suspended wells is included in\n.\nIncome Taxes\nInformation related to income tax contingencies is included in\nand in\nunder the heading “Income Taxes.”\nOther Contingencies\nInformation related to other contingencies is included in\nunder the heading “Other Contingencies.”\nEnvironmental Matters\nThe company is subject to various international, federal, state and local environmental, health and safety laws, regulations and market-based programs. These laws, regulations and programs continue to evolve and are expected to increase in both number and complexity over time and govern not only the manner in which the company conducts its operations, but also the products it sells. For example, international agreements and national, regional, and state legislation and regulatory measures that aim to limit or reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are currently in various stages of implementation. Consideration of GHG issues and the responses to those issues through international agreements and national, regional or state legislation or regulations are integrated into the company’s strategy and planning, capital investment reviews and risk management tools and processes, where applicable. They are also factored into the company’s long-range supply, demand and energy price forecasts. These forecasts reflect long-range effects from renewable fuel penetration, energy efficiency standards, climate-related policy actions, and demand response to oil and natural gas prices. In addition, legislation and regulations intended to address hydraulic fracturing also continue to evolve in many jurisdictions where we operate. Refer to “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 20 through 25 for a discussion of some of the inherent risks of increasingly restrictive environmental and other regulation that could materially impact the company’s results of operations or financial condition.\nMost of the costs of complying with existing laws and regulations pertaining to company operations and products are embedded in the normal costs of doing business. However, it is not possible to predict with certainty the amount of additional investments in new or existing technology or facilities or the amounts of increased operating costs to be incurred in the future to: prevent, control, reduce or eliminate releases of hazardous materials or other pollutants into the environment; remediate and restore areas damaged by prior releases of hazardous materials; or comply with new environmental laws or regulations. Although these costs may be significant to the results of operations in any single period, the company does not presently expect them to have a material adverse effect on the company’s liquidity or financial position.\nAccidental leaks and spills requiring cleanup may occur in the ordinary course of business. The company may incur expenses for corrective actions at various owned and previously owned facilities and at third-party-owned waste disposal sites used by the company. An obligation may arise when operations are closed or sold or at non-Chevron sites where company products have been handled or disposed of. Most of the expenditures to fulfill these obligations relate to facilities and sites where past operations followed practices and procedures that were considered acceptable at the time but now require investigative or remedial work or both to meet current standards.\nUsing definitions and guidelines established by the American Petroleum Institute, Chevron estimated its worldwide environmental spending in 2021 at approximately $1.9 billion for its consolidated companies. Included in these expenditures were approximately $0.3 billion of environmental capital expenditures and $1.6 billion of costs associated\n49\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nwith the prevention, control, abatement or elimination of hazardous substances and pollutants from operating, closed or divested sites, and the decommissioning and restoration of sites.\nFor 2022, total worldwide environmental capital expenditures are estimated at $0.5 billion. These capital costs are in addition to the ongoing costs of complying with environmental regulations and the costs to remediate previously contaminated sites.\nCritical Accounting Estimates and Assumptions\nManagement makes many estimates and assumptions in the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP) that may have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and on the comparability of such information over different reporting periods. Such estimates and assumptions affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses, as well as disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities. Estimates and assumptions are based on management’s experience and other information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements. Materially different results can occur as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nThe discussion in this section of “critical” accounting estimates and assumptions is according to the disclosure guidelines of the SEC, wherein:\n1.\nthe nature of the estimates and assumptions is material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters, or the susceptibility of such matters to change; and\n2.\nthe impact of the estimates and assumptions on the company’s financial condition or operating performance is material.\nThe development and selection of accounting estimates and assumptions, including those deemed “critical,” and the associated disclosures in this discussion have been discussed by management with the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors. The areas of accounting and the associated “critical” estimates and assumptions made by the company are as follows:\nOil and Gas Reserves\nCrude oil and natural gas reserves are estimates of future production that impact certain asset and expense accounts included in the Consolidated Financial Statements. Proved reserves are the estimated quantities of oil and gas that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Proved reserves include both developed and undeveloped volumes. Proved developed reserves represent volumes expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods. Proved undeveloped reserves are volumes expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled proved acreage, or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion. Variables impacting Chevron’s estimated volumes of crude oil and natural gas reserves include field performance, available technology, commodity prices, and development, production and carbon costs.\nThe estimates of crude oil and natural gas reserves are important to the timing of expense recognition for costs incurred and to the valuation of certain oil and gas producing assets. Impacts of oil and gas reserves on Chevron’s Consolidated Financial Statements, using the successful efforts method of accounting, include the following:\n1.\nAmortization - Capitalized exploratory drilling and development costs are depreciated on a unit-of-production (UOP) basis using proved developed reserves. Acquisition costs of proved properties are amortized on a UOP basis using total proved reserves. During 2021, Chevron’s UOP Depreciation, Depletion and Amortization (DD&A) for oil and gas properties was $13.7 billion, and proved developed reserves at the beginning of 2021 were 6.9 billion barrels for consolidated companies. If the estimates of proved reserves used in the UOP calculations for consolidated operations had been lower by five percent across all oil and gas properties, UOP DD&A in 2021 would have increased by approximately $700 million.\n2.\nImpairment - Oil and gas reserves are used in assessing oil and gas producing properties for impairment. A significant reduction in the estimated reserves of a property would trigger an impairment review. Proved reserves (and, in some cases, a portion of unproved resources) are used to estimate future production volumes in the cash flow model. For a further discussion of estimates and assumptions used in impairment assessments, see\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates\nbelow.\nRefer to\n, “Reserve Quantity Information,”, for the changes in proved reserve estimates for the three years ended December 31, 2021, and to\n, “Changes in the Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves” for estimates of proved reserve values for each of the three years ended December 31, 2021.\n50\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nThis Oil and Gas Reserves commentary should be read in conjunction with the Properties, Plant and Equipment section of\n, which includes a description of the “successful efforts” method of accounting for oil and gas exploration and production activities.\nImpairment of Properties, Plant and Equipment and Investments in Affiliates\nThe company assesses its properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. If the carrying value of an asset exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows expected from the asset, an impairment charge is recorded for the excess of the carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value.\nDetermination as to whether and how much an asset is impaired involves management estimates on highly uncertain matters, such as future commodity prices, operating expenses, carbon costs, production profiles, the pace of the energy transition, and the outlook for global or regional market supply-and-demand conditions for crude oil, natural gas, commodity chemicals and refined products. However, the impairment reviews and calculations are based on assumptions that are generally consistent with the company’s business plans and long-term investment decisions. Refer also to the discussion of impairments of properties, plant and equipment in\nand to the section on Properties, Plant and Equipment in\n.\nThe company performs impairment assessments when triggering events arise to determine whether any write-down in the carrying value of an asset or asset group is required. For example, when significant downward revisions to crude oil and natural gas reserves are made for any single field or concession, an impairment review is performed to determine if the carrying value of the asset remains recoverable. Similarly, a significant downward revision in the company’s crude oil or natural gas price outlook would trigger impairment reviews for impacted upstream assets. In addition, impairments could occur due to changes in national, state or local environmental regulations or laws, including those designed to stop or impede the development or production of oil and gas. Also, if the expectation of sale of a particular asset or asset group in any period has been deemed more likely than not, an impairment review is performed, and if the estimated net proceeds exceed the carrying value of the asset or asset group, no impairment charge is required. Such calculations are reviewed each period until the asset or asset group is disposed. Assets that are not impaired on a held-and-used basis could possibly become impaired if a decision is made to sell such assets. That is, the assets would be impaired if they are classified as held-for-sale and the estimated proceeds from the sale, less costs to sell, are less than the assets’ associated carrying values.\nInvestments in common stock of affiliates that are accounted for under the equity method, as well as investments in other securities of these equity investees, are reviewed for impairment when the fair value of the investment falls below the company’s carrying value. When this occurs, a determination must be made as to whether this loss is other-than-temporary, in which case the investment is impaired. Because of the number of differing assumptions potentially affecting whether an investment is impaired in any period or the amount of the impairment, a sensitivity analysis is not practicable.\nA sensitivity analysis of the impact on earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in impairment reviews and impairment calculations is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s PP&E and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions might have avoided the need to impair any assets in these periods, whereas unfavorable changes might have caused an additional unknown number of other assets to become impaired, or resulted in larger impacts on impaired assets.\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nIn the determination of fair value for an asset retirement obligation (ARO), the company uses various assumptions and judgments, including such factors as the existence of a legal obligation, estimated amounts and timing of settlements, discount and inflation rates, and the expected impact of advances in technology and process improvements. A sensitivity analysis of the ARO impact on earnings for 2021 is not practicable, given the broad range of the company’s long-lived assets and the number of assumptions involved in the estimates. That is, favorable changes to some assumptions would have reduced estimated future obligations, thereby lowering accretion expense and amortization costs, whereas unfavorable changes would have the opposite effect. Refer to\nfor additional discussions on asset retirement obligations.\nPension and Other Postretirement Benefit Plans\nincludes information on the funded status of the company’s pension and other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans reflected on the Consolidated Balance Sheet; the components of pension and OPEB expense reflected on the Consolidated Statement of Income; and the related underlying assumptions.\nThe determination of pension plan expense and obligations is based on a number of actuarial assumptions. Two critical assumptions are the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate applied to pension plan\n51\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nobligations. Critical assumptions in determining expense and obligations for OPEB plans, which provide for certain health care and life insurance benefits for qualifying retired employees and which are not funded, are the discount rate and the assumed health care cost-trend rates. Information related to the company’s processes to develop these assumptions is included in\nunder the relevant headings. Actual rates may vary significantly from estimates because of unanticipated changes beyond the company’s control.\nFor 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of 6.5 percent and a discount rate for service costs of 3.0 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.9 percent for the primary U.S. pension plan. The actual return for 2021 was 11.2 percent. For the 10 years ended December 31, 2021, actual asset returns averaged 9.8 percent for this plan. Additionally, with the exception of two years within this 10-year period, actual asset returns for this plan equaled or exceeded 6.5 percent during each year.\nTotal pension expense for 2021 was $1.2 billion. An increase in the expected long-term return on plan assets or the discount rate would reduce pension plan expense, and vice versa. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension expense to the long-term rate of return assumption, a 1 percent increase in this assumption for the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 67 percent of companywide pension expense, would have reduced total pension plan expense for 2021 by approximately $81 million. A 1 percent increase in the discount rates for this same plan would have reduced pension expense for 2021 by approximately $357 million.\nThe aggregate funded status recognized at December 31, 2021, was a net liability of approximately $3.4 billion. An increase in the discount rate would decrease the pension obligation, thus changing the funded status of a plan. At December 31, 2021, the company used a discount rate of 2.8 percent to measure the obligations for the primary U.S. pension plan. As an indication of the sensitivity of pension liabilities to the discount rate assumption, a 0.25 percent increase in the discount rate applied to the company’s primary U.S. pension plan, which accounted for about 60 percent of the companywide pension obligation, would have reduced the plan obligation by approximately $425 million, and would have decreased the plan’s underfunded status from approximately $1.2 billion to $800 million.\nFor the company’s OPEB plans, expense for 2021 was $85 million, and the total liability, all unfunded at the end of 2021, was $2.5 billion. For the primary U.S. OPEB plan, the company used a discount rate for service cost of 2.9 percent and a discount rate for interest cost of 1.6 percent to measure expense in 2021, and a 2.8 percent discount rate to measure the benefit obligations at December 31, 2021. Discount rate changes, similar to those used in the pension sensitivity analysis, resulted in an immaterial impact on 2021 OPEB expense and OPEB liabilities at the end of 2021.\nDifferences between the various assumptions used to determine expense and the funded status of each plan and actual experience are included in actuarial gain/loss. Refer to page 88 in\nfor more information on the $5.1 billion of before-tax actuarial losses recorded by the company as of December 31, 2021. In addition, information related to company contributions is included on page 91 in\nunder the heading “Cash Contributions and Benefit Payments.”\nContingent Losses\nManagement also makes judgments and estimates in recording liabilities for claims, litigation, tax matters and environmental remediation. Actual costs can frequently vary from estimates for a variety of reasons. For example, the costs for settlement of claims and litigation can vary from estimates based on differing interpretations of laws, opinions on culpability and assessments on the amount of damages. Similarly, liabilities for environmental remediation are subject to change because of changes in laws, regulations and their interpretation, the determination of additional information on the extent and nature of site contamination, and improvements in technology.\nUnder the accounting rules, a liability is generally recorded for these types of contingencies if management determines the loss to be both probable and estimable. The company generally reports these losses as “Operating expenses” or “Selling, general and administrative expenses” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. An exception to this handling is for income tax matters, for which benefits are recognized only if management determines the tax position is “more likely than not” (i.e., likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction. For additional discussion of income tax uncertainties, refer to\n. Refer also to the business segment discussions elsewhere in this section for the effect on earnings from losses associated with certain litigation, environmental remediation and tax matters for the three years ended December 31, 2021.\nAn estimate as to the sensitivity to earnings for these periods if other assumptions had been used in recording these liabilities is not practicable because of the number of contingencies that must be assessed, the number of underlying assumptions and the wide range of reasonably possible outcomes, both in terms of the probability of loss and the estimates of such loss. For further information, refer to “Changes in management’s estimates and assumptions may have a material\n52\nManagement's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nimpact on the company’s consolidated financial statements and financial or operational performance in any given period” in “Risk Factors” in Part I, Item 1A, on pages 24 and 25.\nNew Accounting Standards\nRefer to\nfor information regarding new accounting standards.\n53\nQuarterly Results\nUnaudited\n54\n55\n56\n57\nConsolidated Statement of Income\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n58\nConsolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income\nMillions of dollars\n59\nConsolidated Balance Sheet\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n60\nConsolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nMillions of dollars\n61\nConsolidated Statement of Equity\nAmounts in millions of dollars\n62\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 1\nSummary of Significant Accounting Policies\nGeneral\nThe company’s Consolidated Financial Statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. These require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses reported in the financial statements, as well as amounts included in the notes thereto, including discussion and disclosure of contingent liabilities. Although the company uses its best estimates and judgments, actual results could differ from these estimates as circumstances change and additional information becomes known.\nSubsidiary and Affiliated Companies\nThe Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of controlled subsidiary companies more than 50 percent-owned and any variable interest entities in which the company is the primary beneficiary. Undivided interests in oil and gas joint ventures and certain other assets are consolidated on a proportionate basis. Investments in and advances to affiliates in which the company has a substantial ownership interest of approximately 20 percent to 50 percent, or for which the company exercises significant influence but not control over policy decisions, are accounted for by the equity method.\nInvestments in affiliates are assessed for possible impairment when events indicate that the fair value of the investment may be below the company’s carrying value. When such a condition is deemed to be other than temporary, the carrying value of the investment is written down to its fair value, and the amount of the write-down is included in net income. In making the determination as to whether a decline is other than temporary, the company considers such factors as the duration and extent of the decline, the investee’s financial performance, and the company’s ability and intention to retain its investment for a period that will be sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in the investment’s market value. The new cost basis of investments in these equity investees is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value.\nDifferences between the company’s carrying value of an equity investment and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliate are assigned to the extent practicable to specific assets and liabilities based on the company’s analysis of the various factors giving rise to the difference. When appropriate, the company’s share of the affiliate’s reported earnings is adjusted quarterly to reflect the difference between these allocated values and the affiliate’s historical book values.\nNoncontrolling Interests\nOwnership interests in the company’s subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent are presented separately from the parent’s equity on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and the noncontrolling interests are both presented on the face of the Consolidated Statement of Income and Consolidated Statement of Equity. Included within noncontrolling interest is redeemable noncontrolling interest.\nFair Value Measurements\nThe three levels of the fair value hierarchy of inputs the company uses to measure the fair value of an asset or a liability are as follows. Level 1 inputs are quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability. Level 3 inputs are inputs that are not observable in the market.\nDerivatives\nThe majority of the company’s activity in derivative commodity instruments is intended to manage the financial risk posed by physical transactions. For some of this derivative activity, the company may elect to apply fair value or cash flow hedge accounting with changes in fair value recorded as components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss). For other similar derivative instruments, generally because of the short-term nature of the contracts or their limited use, the company does not apply hedge accounting, and changes in the fair value of those contracts are reflected in current income. For the company’s commodity trading activity, gains and losses from derivative instruments are reported in current income. The company may enter into interest rate swaps from time to time as part of its overall strategy to manage the interest rate risk on its debt. Interest rate swaps related to a portion of the company’s fixed-rate debt, if any, may be accounted for as fair value hedges. Interest rate swaps related to floating-rate debt, if any, are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet with resulting gains and losses reflected in income. Where Chevron is a party to master netting arrangements, fair value receivable and payable amounts recognized for derivative instruments executed with the same counterparty are generally offset on the balance sheet.\nInventories\nCrude oil, petroleum products and chemicals inventories are generally stated at cost, using a last-in, first-out method. In the aggregate, these costs are below market. “Materials, supplies and other” inventories are primarily stated at cost or net realizable value.\n63\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nProperties, Plant and Equipment\nThe successful efforts method is used for crude oil and natural gas exploration and production activities. All costs for development wells, related plant and equipment, proved mineral interests in crude oil and natural gas properties, and related asset retirement obligation (ARO) assets are capitalized. Costs of exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether the wells found proved reserves. Costs of wells that are assigned proved reserves remain capitalized. Costs also are capitalized for exploratory wells that have found crude oil and natural gas reserves even if the reserves cannot be classified as proved when the drilling is completed, provided the exploratory well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify its completion as a producing well and the company is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. All other exploratory wells and costs are expensed. Refer to\nfor additional discussion of accounting for suspended exploratory well costs.\nLong-lived assets to be held and used, including proved crude oil and natural gas properties, are assessed for possible impairment by comparing their carrying values with their associated undiscounted, future net cash flows. Events that can trigger assessments for possible impairments include write-downs of proved reserves based on field performance, significant decreases in the market value of an asset (including changes to the commodity price forecast or carbon costs), significant change in the extent or manner of use of or a physical change in an asset, and a more-likely-than-not expectation that a long-lived asset or asset group will be sold or otherwise disposed of significantly sooner than the end of its previously estimated useful life. Impaired assets are written down to their estimated fair values, generally their discounted, future net cash flows. For proved crude oil and natural gas properties, the company performs impairment reviews on a country, concession, PSC, development area or field basis, as appropriate. In Downstream, impairment reviews are performed on the basis of a refinery, a plant, a marketing/lubricants area or distribution area, as appropriate. Impairment amounts are recorded as incremental “Depreciation, depletion and amortization” expense.\nLong-lived assets that are held for sale are evaluated for possible impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset with its fair value less the cost to sell. If the net book value exceeds the fair value less cost to sell, the asset is considered impaired and adjusted to the lower value. Refer to\nrelating to fair value measurements. The fair value of a liability for an ARO is recorded as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a long-lived asset and the amount can be reasonably estimated. Refer also to\nrelating to AROs.\nDepreciation and depletion of all capitalized costs of proved crude oil and natural gas producing properties, except mineral interests, are expensed using the unit-of-production method, generally by individual field, as the proved developed reserves are produced. Depletion expenses for capitalized costs of proved mineral interests are recognized using the unit-of-production method by individual field as the related proved reserves are produced. Impairments of capitalized costs of unproved mineral interests are expensed.\nThe capitalized costs of all other plant and equipment are depreciated or amortized over their estimated useful lives. In general, the declining-balance method is used to depreciate plant and equipment in the United States; the straight-line method is generally used to depreciate international plant and equipment and to amortize finance lease right-of-use assets.\nGains or losses are not recognized for normal retirements of properties, plant and equipment subject to composite group amortization or depreciation. Gains or losses from abnormal retirements are recorded as expenses, and from sales as “Other income.”\nExpenditures for maintenance (including those for planned major maintenance projects), repairs and minor renewals to maintain facilities in operating condition are generally expensed as incurred. Major replacements and renewals are capitalized.\nLeases\nLeases are classified as operating or finance leases. Both operating and finance leases recognize lease liabilities and associated right-of-use assets. The company has elected the short-term lease exception and therefore only recognizes right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for leases with a term greater than one year. The company has elected the practical expedient to not separate non-lease components from lease components for most asset classes except for certain asset classes that have significant non-lease (i.e., service) components.\nWhere leases are used in joint ventures, the company recognizes\n100\npercent of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities when the company is the sole signatory for the lease (in most cases, where the company is the operator of a joint venture). Lease costs reflect only the costs associated with the operator’s working interest share. The lease term includes the committed lease term identified in the contract, taking into account renewal and termination options that management is\n64\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nreasonably certain to exercise. The company uses its incremental borrowing rate as a proxy for the discount rate based on the term of the lease unless the implicit rate is available.\nGoodwill\nGoodwill resulting from a business combination is not subject to amortization. The company tests such goodwill at the reporting unit level for impairment annually at December 31, or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying amount.\nEnvironmental Expenditures\nEnvironmental expenditures that relate to ongoing operations or to conditions caused by past operations are expensed. Expenditures that create future benefits or contribute to future revenue generation are capitalized.\nLiabilities related to future remediation costs are recorded when environmental assessments or cleanups or both are probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. For crude oil, natural gas and mineral-producing properties, a liability for an ARO is made in accordance with accounting standards for asset retirement and environmental obligations. Refer to\nfor a discussion of the company’s AROs.\nFor U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, the company records a liability for its designated share of the probable and estimable costs, and probable amounts for other potentially responsible parties when mandated by the regulatory agencies because the other parties are not able to pay their respective shares. The gross amount of environmental liabilities is based on the company’s best estimate of future costs using currently available technology and applying current regulations and the company’s own internal environmental policies. Future amounts are not discounted. Recoveries or reimbursements are recorded as assets when receipt is reasonably assured.\nCurrency Translation\nThe U.S. dollar is the functional currency for substantially all of the company’s consolidated operations and those of its equity affiliates. For those operations, all gains and losses from currency remeasurement are included in current period income. The cumulative translation effects for those few entities, both consolidated and affiliated, using functional currencies other than the U.S. dollar are included in “Currency translation adjustment” on the Consolidated Statement of Equity.\nRevenue Recognition\nThe company accounts for each delivery order of crude oil, natural gas, petroleum and chemical products as a separate performance obligation. Revenue is recognized when the performance obligation is satisfied, which typically occurs at the point in time when control of the product transfers to the customer.\nPayment is generally due within 30 days of delivery.\nThe company accounts for delivery transportation as a fulfillment cost, not a separate performance obligation, and recognizes these costs as an operating expense in the period when revenue for the related commodity is recognized.\nRevenue is measured as the amount the company expects to receive in exchange for transferring commodities to the customer. The company’s commodity sales are typically based on prevailing market-based prices and may include discounts and allowances. Until market prices become known under terms of the company’s contracts, the transaction price included in revenue is based on the company’s estimate of the most likely outcome.\nDiscounts and allowances are estimated using a combination of historical and recent data trends. When deliveries contain multiple products, an observable standalone selling price is generally used to measure revenue for each product. The company includes estimates in the transaction price only to the extent that a significant reversal of revenue is not probable in subsequent periods.\nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation\nThe company issues stock options and other share-based compensation to certain employees. For equity awards, such as stock options, total compensation cost is based on the grant date fair value, and for liability awards, such as stock appreciation rights, total compensation cost is based on the settlement value. The company recognizes stock-based compensation expense for all awards over the service period required to earn the award, which is the shorter of the vesting period or the time period in which an employee becomes eligible to retain the award at retirement. The company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards include stock options and stock appreciation rights, which have graded vesting provisions by which one-third of each award vests on each of the first, second and third anniversaries of the date of grant. In addition, performance shares granted under the company’s LTIP will vest at the end of the\nthree\n-year performance period. For awards granted under the company’s LTIP beginning in 2017, stock options and stock appreciation rights have graded vesting by which one third of each award vests annually on each January 31 on or after the first anniversary of the grant date. Standard restricted stock unit awards have cliff vesting by which the total award will vest on January 31 on or after the fifth anniversary of the grant date, subject to adjustment upon termination pursuant to the satisfaction of certain criteria. The company amortizes these awards on a straight-line basis.\n65\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 2\nChanges in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses\nThe change in Accumulated Other Comprehensive Losses (AOCL) presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheet and the impact of significant amounts reclassified from AOCL on information presented in the Consolidated Statement of Income for the year ended December 31, 2021, are reflected in the table below.\n1\nAll amounts are net of tax.\n2\nRefer to\nfor cash flow hedging.\n3\nRefer to\n, for reclassified components, including amortization of actuarial gains or losses, amortization of prior service costs and settlement losses, totaling $\n1,055\nthat are included in employee benefit costs for the year ended December 31, 2021. Related income taxes for the same period, totaling $\n225\n, are reflected in Income Tax Expense on the Consolidated Statement of Income. All other reclassified amounts were insignificant.\n66\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 3\nInformation Relating to the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows\nThe “Other” line in the Operating Activities section includes changes in postretirement benefits obligations and other long-term liabilities.\nThe Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows excludes changes to the Consolidated Balance Sheet that did not affect cash. “Distributions more (less) than income from equity affiliates,” “Depreciation, depletion and amortization,” “Deferred income tax provision,” and “Dry hole expense,” collectively include approximately $\n4.8\nbillion in non-cash reductions to properties, plant and equipment in 2020 relating to impairments and other non-cash charges. The company did not have any material impairments in 2021.\n67\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nRefer also to\nfor a discussion of revisions to the company’s AROs that also did not involve cash receipts or payments for the three years ending December 31, 2021.\nThe major components of “Capital expenditures” and the reconciliation of this amount to the reported capital and exploratory expenditures, including equity affiliates, are presented in the following table.\n*\nExcludes non-cash movements of $\n316\nin 2021, $\n816\nin 2020 and $(\n239\n) in 2019.\nThe table below quantifies the beginning and ending balances of restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the Consolidated Balance Sheet:\nNote 4\nNew Accounting Standards\nThere are not currently any new or pending accounting standards that have a significant impact on Chevron.\nNote 5\nLease Commitments\nThe company enters into leasing arrangements as a lessee; any lessor arrangements are not significant. Operating lease arrangements mainly involve land, bareboat charters, terminals, drill ships, drilling rigs, time chartered vessels, office buildings and warehouses, and exploration and production equipment. Finance leases primarily include facilities, vessels, office buildings, and production equipment.\nDetails of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities for operating and finance leases, including the balance sheet presentation, are as follows:\n68\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n*\nIncludes non-cash additions of $\n1,063\nand $\n60\nin 2021, and $\n1,353\nand $\n164\nin 2020 for right-of-use assets obtained in exchange for new and modified lease liabilities for operating and finance leases, respectively. 2020 includes $\n566\nin operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n566\nlease liabilities associated with the Puma acquisition. 2020 also includes $\n124\nin operating lease right-of-use assets and $\n148\nlease liabilities, and $\n112\nin finance lease right-of-use assets and $\n309\nlease liabilities associated with the Noble acquisition.\nTotal lease costs consist of both amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Income during the period and amounts capitalized as part of the cost of another asset. Total lease costs incurred for operating and finance leases were as follows:\n*\nIncludes variable and short-term lease costs.\nCash paid for amounts included in the measurement of lease liabilities was as follows:\nAt December 31, 2021, the estimated future undiscounted cash flows for operating and finance leases were as follows:\nAdditionally, the company has $\n1,074\nin future undiscounted cash flows for operating leases not yet commenced. These leases are primarily for a drill ship and drilling rigs. For those leasing arrangements where the underlying asset is not yet constructed, the lessor is primarily involved in the design and construction of the asset.\n69\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 6\nSummarized Financial Data – Chevron U.S.A. Inc.\nChevron U.S.A. Inc. (CUSA) is a major subsidiary of Chevron Corporation. CUSA and its subsidiaries manage and operate most of Chevron’s U.S. businesses. Assets include those related to the exploration and production of crude oil, natural gas and natural gas liquids and those associated with the refining, marketing, supply and distribution of products derived from petroleum, excluding most of the regulated pipeline operations of Chevron. CUSA also holds the company’s investment in the Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC joint venture, which is accounted for using the equity method.\nThe summarized financial information for CUSA and its consolidated subsidiaries is as follows:\nNote 7\nSummarized Financial Data – Tengizchevroil LLP\nChevron has a\n50\npercent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil LLP (TCO). Refer to\nfor a discussion of TCO operations.\nSummarized financial information for\n100\npercent of TCO is presented in the table below:\nNote 8\nSummarized Financial Data – Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC\nChevron has a\n50\npercent equity ownership interest in Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC (CPChem). Refer to\nfor a discussion of CPChem operations.\nSummarized financial information for\n100\npercent of CPChem is presented in the table below:\n70\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 9\nFair Value Measurements\nThe tables below show the fair value hierarchy for assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nMarketable Securities\nThe company calculates fair value for its marketable securities based on quoted market prices for identical assets. The fair values reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were sold at December 31, 2021.\nDerivatives\nThe company records most of its derivative instruments – other than any commodity derivative contracts that are accounted for as normal purchase and normal sale – on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value, with the offsetting amount to the Consolidated Statement of Income. The company designates certain derivative instruments as cash flow hedges that, if applicable, are reflected in the table below. Derivatives classified as Level 1 include futures, swaps and options contracts traded in active markets such as the New York Mercantile Exchange. Derivatives classified as Level 2 include swaps, options and forward contracts principally with financial institutions and other oil and gas companies, the fair values of which are obtained from third-party broker quotes, industry pricing services and exchanges. The company obtains multiple sources of pricing information for the Level 2 instruments. Since this pricing information is generated from observable market data, it has historically been very consistent. The company does not materially adjust this information.\nProperties, Plant and Equipment\nThe company did not have any individually material impairments in 2021. The company reported impairments for certain upstream properties in 2020 primarily due to downward revisions to its oil and gas price outlook.\nInvestments and Advances\nIn 2021, the company did not have any material impairments of investments and advances measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in Petropiar and Petroboscan in Venezuela. The impact of these impairments is included in “Income (loss) from equity affiliates” on the Consolidated Statement of Income.\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Recurring Basis\nAssets and Liabilities Measured at Fair Value on a Nonrecurring Basis\n71\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nAt year-end 2021, the company had assets measured at fair value Level 3 using unobservable inputs of $\n140\n. The carrying value of these assets were written down to fair value based on estimates derived from internal discounted cash flow models. Cash flows were determined using estimates of future production, an outlook of future price based on published prices and a discount rate believed to be consistent with those used by principal market participants.\nAssets and Liabilities Not Required to Be Measured at Fair Value\nThe company holds cash equivalents in U.S. and non-U.S. portfolios. The instruments classified as cash equivalents are primarily bank time deposits with maturities of\n90\ndays or less and money market funds. “Cash and cash equivalents” had carrying/fair values of $\n5,640\nand $\n5,596\nat December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. The fair values of cash and cash equivalents are classified as Level 1 and reflect the cash that would have been received if the instruments were settled at December 31, 2021.\n“Cash and cash equivalents” do not include investments with a carrying/fair value of $\n1,155\nand $\n1,141\nat December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively. At December 31, 2021, these investments are classified as Level 1 and include restricted funds related to certain upstream decommissioning activities, tax payments and a financing program.\nLong-term debt, excluding finance lease liabilities, of $\n22,164\nand $\n30,805\nat December 31, 2021, and December 31, 2020, respectively, had estimated fair values of $\n23,670\nand $\n34,390\n, respectively. Long-term debt primarily includes corporate issued bonds. The fair value of corporate bonds is $\n22,835\nand classified as Level 1. The fair value of other long-term debt is $\n835\nand classified as Level 2.\nThe carrying values of short-term financial assets and liabilities on the Consolidated Balance Sheet approximate their fair values. Fair value remeasurements of other financial instruments at December 31, 2021 and 2020, were not material.\nNote 10\nFinancial and Derivative Instruments\nDerivative Commodity Instruments\nThe company’s derivative commodity instruments principally include crude oil, natural gas, liquefied natural gas and refined product futures, swaps, options, and forward contracts. The company applies cash flow hedge accounting to certain commodity transactions, where appropriate, to manage the market price risk associated with forecasted sales of crude oil. The company’s derivatives are not material to the company’s financial position, results of operations or liquidity. The company believes it has no material market or credit risks to its operations, financial position or liquidity as a result of its commodity derivative activities.\nThe company uses derivative commodity instruments traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange and on electronic platforms of the Inter-Continental Exchange and Chicago Mercantile Exchange. In addition, the company enters into swap contracts and option contracts principally with major financial institutions and other oil and gas companies in the “over-the-counter” markets, which are governed by International Swaps and Derivatives Association agreements and other master netting arrangements. Depending on the nature of the derivative transactions, bilateral collateral arrangements may also be required.\nDerivative instruments measured at fair value at December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and their classification on the Consolidated Balance Sheet below and Consolidated Statement of Income on the following page:\nConsolidated Balance Sheet: Fair Value of Derivatives\n72\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nConsolidated Statement of Income: The Effect of Derivatives\nAll designated cash flow hedges during the year were settled by December 31, 2021. The impact on sales and other operating revenues from designated hedges in 2021 was immaterial.\nThe table below represents gross and net derivative assets and liabilities subject to netting agreements on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020.\nConsolidated Balance Sheet: The Effect of Netting Derivative Assets and Liabilities\nDerivative assets and liabilities are classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as accounts and notes receivable, long-term receivables, accounts payable, and deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations. Amounts not offset on the Consolidated Balance Sheet represent positions that do not meet all the conditions for “a right of offset.”\nConcentrations of Credit Risk\nThe company’s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of its cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments and trade receivables. The company’s short-term investments are placed with a wide array of financial institutions with high credit ratings. Company investment policies limit the company’s exposure both to credit risk and to concentrations of credit risk. Similar policies on diversification and creditworthiness are applied to the company’s counterparties in derivative instruments. For a discussion of credit risk on trade receivables, see\n.\nNote 11\nAssets Held for Sale\nAt December 31, 2021, the company classified $\n768\nof net properties, plant and equipment as “Assets held for sale” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. These assets are associated with upstream operations that are anticipated to be sold in the next 12 months. The revenues and earnings contributions of these assets in 2021 were not material.\nNote 12\nEquity\nRetained earnings at December 31, 2021 and 2020, included $\n28,876\nand $\n26,532\n, respectively, for the company’s share of undistributed earnings of equity affiliates.\nAt December 31, 2021, about\n66\nmillion shares of Chevron’s common stock remained available for issuance from the\n260\nmillion shares that were reserved for issuance under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan. In addition,\n614,768\nshares remain available for issuance from the\n1,600,000\nshares of the company’s common stock that were reserved for awards under the Chevron Corporation Non-Employee Directors’ Equity Compensation and Deferral Plan.\n73\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 13\nEarnings Per Share\nBasic earnings per share (EPS) is based upon “Net Income (Loss) Attributable to Chevron Corporation” (“earnings”) and includes the effects of deferrals of salary and other compensation awards that are invested in Chevron stock units by certain officers and employees of the company. Diluted EPS includes the effects of these items as well as the dilutive effects of outstanding stock options awarded under the company’s stock option programs (refer to\n).\nThe table below sets forth the computation of basic and diluted EPS:\nNote 14\nOperating Segments and Geographic Data\nAlthough each subsidiary of Chevron is responsible for its own affairs, Chevron Corporation manages its investments in these subsidiaries and their affiliates. The investments are grouped into\ntwo\nbusiness segments, Upstream and Downstream, representing the company’s “reportable segments” and “operating segments.” Upstream operations consist primarily of exploring for, developing, producing and transporting crude oil and natural gas; liquefaction, transportation and regasification associated with liquefied natural gas (LNG); transporting crude oil by major international oil export pipelines; processing, transporting, storage and marketing of natural gas; and a gas-to-liquids plant. Downstream operations consist primarily of refining of crude oil into petroleum products; marketing of crude oil, refined products, and lubricants; manufacturing and marketing of renewable fuels; transporting of crude oil and refined products by pipeline, marine vessel, motor equipment and rail car; and manufacturing and marketing of commodity petrochemicals, plastics for industrial uses, and fuel and lubricant additives. All Other activities of the company include worldwide cash management and debt financing activities, corporate administrative functions, insurance operations, real estate activities, and technology activities.\nThe company’s segments are managed by “segment managers” who report to the “chief operating decision maker” (CODM). The segments represent components of the company that engage in activities (a) from which revenues are earned and expenses are incurred; (b) whose operating results are regularly reviewed by the CODM, which makes decisions about resources to be allocated to the segments and assesses their performance; and (c) for which discrete financial information is available.\nThe company’s primary country of operation is the United States of America, its country of domicile. Other components of the company’s operations are reported as “International” (outside the United States).\nSegment Earnings\nThe company evaluates the performance of its operating segments on an after-tax basis, without considering the effects of debt financing interest expense or investment interest income, both of which are managed by the company on a worldwide basis. Corporate administrative costs are not allocated to the operating segments. However, operating segments are billed for the direct use of corporate services. Non-billable costs remain at the corporate level in “All Other.”\nEarnings by major operating area are presented in the following table:\n74\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nSegment Assets\nSegment assets do not include intercompany investments or receivables.\nAssets at year-end 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\nSegment Sales and Other Operating Revenues\nOperating segment sales and other operating revenues, including internal transfers, for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019, are presented in the table on the next page. Products are transferred between operating segments at internal product values that approximate market prices.\nRevenues for the upstream segment are derived primarily from the production and sale of crude oil and natural gas, as well as the sale of third-party production of natural gas. Revenues for the downstream segment are derived from the refining and marketing of petroleum products such as gasoline, jet fuel, gas oils, lubricants, residual fuel oils and other products derived from crude oil. This segment also generates revenues from the manufacture and sale of fuel and lubricant additives and the transportation and trading of refined products and crude oil. “All Other” activities include revenues from insurance operations, real estate activities and technology companies.\n75\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n1\nOther than the United States, no other country accounted for 10 percent or more of the company’s Sales and Other Operating Revenues.\nSegment Income Taxes\nSegment income tax expense for the years 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows:\nOther Segment Information\nAdditional information for the segmentation of major equity affiliates is contained in\n. Information related to properties, plant and equipment by segment is contained in\n.\n76\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 15\nInvestments and Advances\nEquity in earnings, together with investments in and advances to companies accounted for using the equity method and other investments accounted for at or below cost, is shown in the following table. For certain equity affiliates, Chevron pays its share of some income taxes directly. For such affiliates, the equity in earnings does not include these taxes, which are reported on the Consolidated Statement of Income as “Income tax expense.”\n* Upstream Other line includes amounts previously reported as Noble Midstream equity affiliates.\nDescriptions of major affiliates and non-equity investments, including significant differences between the company’s carrying value of its investments and its underlying equity in the net assets of the affiliates, are as follows:\nTengizchevroil\nChevron has a\n50\npercent equity ownership interest in Tengizchevroil (TCO), which operates the Tengiz and Korolev crude oil fields in Kazakhstan. At December 31, 2021, the company’s carrying value of its investment in TCO was about $\n100\nhigher than the amount of underlying equity in TCO’s net assets. This difference results from Chevron acquiring a portion of its interest in TCO at a value greater than the underlying book value for that portion of TCO’s net assets. Included in the investment is a loan to TCO to fund the development of the FGP/WPMP with a balance of $\n4,500\n.\nPetropiar\nChevron has a\n30\npercent interest in Petropiar, a joint stock company which operates the heavy oil Huyapari Field and upgrading project in Venezuela’s Orinoco Belt. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petropiar affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment.\nPetroboscan\nChevron has a\n39.2\npercent interest in Petroboscan, a joint stock company which operates the Boscan Field in Venezuela. In 2020, the company fully impaired its investments in the Petroboscan affiliate and, effective July 1, 2020, began accounting for this venture as a non-equity method investment. The company also has an outstanding long-term loan to Petroboscan of $\n560\n, which has been fully provisioned for at year-end 2021.\nCaspian Pipeline Consortium\nChevron has a\n15\npercent interest in the Caspian Pipeline Consortium, which provides the critical export route for crude oil from both TCO and Karachaganak.\nAngola LNG Limited\nChevron has a\n36.4\npercent interest in Angola LNG Limited, which processes and liquefies natural gas produced in Angola for delivery to international markets.\nChevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC\nChevron owns\n50\npercent of Chevron Phillips Chemical Company LLC. The other half is owned by Phillips 66.\nGS Caltex Corporation\nChevron owns\n50\npercent of GS Caltex Corporation, a joint venture with GS Energy in South Korea. The joint venture imports, refines and markets petroleum products, petrochemicals and lubricants.\n77\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nOther Information\n“Sales and other operating revenues” on the Consolidated Statement of Income includes $\n10,796\n, $\n6,038\nand $\n8,006\nwith affiliated companies for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. “Purchased crude oil and products” includes $\n5,778\n, $\n3,003\nand $\n5,694\nwith affiliated companies for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n“Accounts and notes receivable” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet includes $\n1,454\nand $\n807\ndue from affiliated companies at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. “Accounts payable” includes $\n552\nand $\n244\ndue to affiliated companies at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table provides summarized financial information on a\n100\npercent basis for all equity affiliates as well as Chevron’s total share, which includes Chevron’s net loans to affiliates of $\n4,704\n, $\n5,153\nand $\n4,331\nat December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 16\nLitigation\nEcuador\nTexaco Petroleum Company (Texpet), a subsidiary of Texaco Inc., was a minority member of an oil production consortium with Ecuadorian state-owned Petroecuador from 1967 until 1992. After termination of the consortium and a third-party environmental audit, Ecuador and the consortium parties entered into a settlement agreement specifying Texpet’s remediation obligations. Following Texpet’s completion of a\nthree\n-year remediation program, Ecuador certified the remediation as proper and released Texpet and its affiliates from environmental liability. In May 2003, plaintiffs alleging environmental harm from the consortium’s activities sued Chevron in the Superior Court in Lago Agrio, Ecuador. In February 2011, that court entered a judgment against Chevron for approximately $\n9,500\nplus additional punitive damages. An appellate panel affirmed, and Ecuador’s National Court of Justice ratified the judgment but nullified the punitive damages, resulting in a judgment of approximately $\n9,500\n. Ecuador’s highest Constitutional Court rejected Chevron’s final appeal in July 2018.\nIn February 2011, Chevron sued the Lago Agrio plaintiffs and several of their lawyers and supporters in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (SDNY) for violations of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and state law. The SDNY court ruled that the Ecuadorian judgment had been procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption, and prohibited the RICO defendants from seeking to enforce the Ecuadorian judgment in the United States or profiting from their illegal acts. The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed, and the U.S. Supreme Court denied certiorari in June 2017, rendering final the U.S. judgment in favor of Chevron. The Lago Agrio plaintiffs sought to have the Ecuadorian judgment recognized and enforced in Canada, Brazil, and Argentina. All of those recognition and enforcement actions were dismissed and resolved in Chevron’s favor. Chevron and Texpet filed an arbitration claim against Ecuador in September 2009 before an arbitral tribunal administered by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, under the United States-Ecuador Bilateral Investment Treaty. In August 2018, the Tribunal issued an award holding that the Ecuadorian judgment was based on environmental claims that Ecuador had settled and released, and that it was procured through fraud, bribery, and corruption. According to the Tribunal, the Ecuadorian judgment “violates international public policy” and “should not be recognized or enforced by the courts of other States.” The Tribunal ordered Ecuador to remove the status of enforceability from the Ecuadorian judgment and to compensate Chevron for any injuries resulting from the judgment. The third and final phase of the arbitration, to determine the amount of compensation Ecuador owes to Chevron, is ongoing. In September 2020, the District Court of The Hague denied Ecuador’s request to set aside the Tribunal’s award, stating that it now is “common ground” between Ecuador and Chevron that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent. In December 2020, Ecuador appealed the District Court’s decision to The Hague Court of Appeals. In a\n78\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nseparate proceeding, Ecuador also admitted that the Ecuadorian judgment is fraudulent in a public filing with the Office of the United States Trade Representative in July 2020. Management continues to believe that the Ecuadorian judgment is illegitimate and unenforceable and will vigorously defend against any further attempts to have it recognized or enforced.\nClimate Change\nGovernmental and other entities in various jurisdictions across the United States have filed legal proceedings against fossil fuel producing companies, including Chevron entities, purporting to seek legal and equitable relief to address alleged impacts of climate change. Chevron entities are or were among the codefendants in\n21\nseparate lawsuits brought by 17 U.S. cities and counties, two U.S. states, the District of Columbia and a trade group. One of the city lawsuits was dismissed on the merits, and one of the county lawsuits was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff. The lawsuits assert various causes of action, including public nuisance, private nuisance, failure to warn, design defect, product defect, trespass, negligence, impairment of public trust, and violations of consumer protection statutes, based upon the company’s production of oil and gas products and alleged misrepresentations or omissions relating to climate change risks associated with those products. The unprecedented legal theories set forth in these proceedings entail the possibility of damages liability (both compensatory and punitive), injunctive and other forms of equitable relief, including without limitation abatement and disgorgement of profits, civil penalties and liability for fees and costs of suits, that, while we believe remote, could have a material adverse effect on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Further such proceedings are likely to be filed by other parties. Management believes that these proceedings are legally and factually meritless and detract from constructive efforts to address the important policy issues presented by climate change, and will vigorously defend against such proceedings.\nLouisiana\nSeven coastal parishes and the State of Louisiana have filed lawsuits in Louisiana against numerous oil and gas companies seeking damages for coastal erosion in or near oil fields located within Louisiana’s coastal zone under Louisiana’s State and Local Coastal Resources Management Act (SLCRMA). Chevron entities are defendants in\n39\nof these cases. The lawsuits allege that the defendants’ historical operations were conducted without necessary permits or failed to comply with permits obtained and seek damages and other relief, including the costs of restoring coastal wetlands allegedly impacted by oil field operations. Plaintiffs’ SLCRMA theories are unprecedented; thus, there remains significant uncertainty about the scope of the claims and alleged damages and any potential effects on the company’s results of operations and financial condition. Management believes that the claims lack legal and factual merit and will continue to vigorously defend against such proceedings.\nNote 17\nTaxes\nThe reconciliation between the U.S. statutory federal income tax rate and the company’s effective income tax rate is detailed in the following table:\n79\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n1\nIncludes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in uncertain tax positions.\n2\nIncludes one-time tax costs (benefits) associated with changes in valuation allowances (2021 - $(\n624\n); 2020 - $\n0\n; 2019 - $\n0\n).\nThe 2021 increase in income tax expense of $\n7,842\nis a result of the year-over-year increase in total income before income tax expense, which is primarily due to higher upstream realizations, the absence of 2020 impairment and write-offs and higher downstream margins. The company’s effective tax rate changed from\n25.4\npercent in 2020 to\n27.5\npercent in 2021. The change in effective tax rate is mainly due to mix effects resulting from the absolute level of earnings or losses and whether they arose in higher or lower tax rate jurisdictions.\nThe company records its deferred taxes on a tax-jurisdiction basis.\nThe reported deferred tax balances are composed of the following:\nDeferred tax liabilities decreased by $\n946\nfrom year-end 2020. The decrease to Investments and other was driven by a consolidated subsidiary restructuring, partially offset with an increase to Properties, plant and equipment. Deferred tax assets decreased by $\n2,780\nfrom year-end 2020. This decrease was primarily related to decreases in tax loss carryforwards for various locations, and employee benefits, partially offset by the increase in foreign tax credits.\nThe overall valuation allowance relates to deferred tax assets for U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards, tax loss carryforwards and temporary differences. The valuation allowance reduces the deferred tax assets to amounts that are, in management’s assessment, more likely than not to be realized. At the end of 2021, the company had gross tax loss carryforwards of approximately $\n10,750\nand tax credit carryforwards of approximately $\n993\n, primarily related to various international tax jurisdictions. Whereas some of these tax loss carryforwards do not have an expiration date, others expire at various times from 2022 through 2040. U.S. foreign tax credit carryforwards of $\n11,718\nwill expire between 2022 and 2032.\n80\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nAt December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred taxes were classified on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as follows:\nIncome taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The indefinite reinvestment assertion continues to apply for the purpose of determining deferred tax liabilities for U.S. state and foreign withholding tax purposes.\nU.S. state and foreign withholding taxes are not accrued for unremitted earnings of international operations that have been or are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. Undistributed earnings of international consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates for which no deferred income tax provision has been made for possible future remittances totaled approximately $\n49,200\nat December 31, 2021. This amount represents earnings reinvested as part of the company’s ongoing international business. It is not practicable to estimate the amount of state and foreign taxes that might be payable on the possible remittance of earnings that are intended to be reinvested indefinitely. The company does not anticipate incurring significant additional taxes on remittances of earnings that are not indefinitely reinvested.\nUncertain Income Tax Positions\nThe company recognizes a tax benefit in the financial statements for an uncertain tax position only if management’s assessment is that the position is “more likely than not” (i.e., a likelihood greater than 50 percent) to be allowed by the tax jurisdiction based solely on the technical merits of the position. The term “tax position” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to a position in a previously filed tax return or a position expected to be taken in a future tax return that is reflected in measuring current or deferred income tax assets and liabilities for interim or annual periods.\nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s unrecognized tax benefits for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019. The term “unrecognized tax benefits” in the accounting standards for income taxes refers to the differences between a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and the benefit measured and recognized in the financial statements. Interest and penalties are not included.\nApproximately\n82\npercent of the $\n5,288\nof unrecognized tax benefits at December 31, 2021, would have an impact on the effective tax rate if subsequently recognized. Certain of these unrecognized tax benefits relate to tax carryforwards that may require a full valuation allowance at the time of any such recognition.\nTax positions for Chevron and its subsidiaries and affiliates are subject to income tax audits by many tax jurisdictions throughout the world. For the company’s major tax jurisdictions, examinations of tax returns for certain prior tax years had not been completed as of December 31, 2021. For these jurisdictions, the latest years for which income tax examinations had been finalized were as follows: United States – 2013, Nigeria – 2007, Australia – 2009, Kazakhstan – 2012 and Saudi Arabia – 2015.\nThe company engages in ongoing discussions with tax authorities regarding the resolution of tax matters in the various jurisdictions. Both the outcome of these tax matters and the timing of resolution and/or closure of the tax audits are highly uncertain. However, it is reasonably possible that developments on tax matters in certain tax jurisdictions may result in significant increases or decreases in the company’s total unrecognized tax benefits within the next 12 months. Given the number of years that still remain subject to examination and the number of matters being examined in the various tax jurisdictions, the company is unable to estimate the range of possible adjustments to the balance of unrecognized tax benefits.\n81\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nOn the Consolidated Statement of Income, the company reports interest and penalties related to liabilities for uncertain tax positions as “Income tax expense.” As of December 31, 2021, accrual benefit of $(\n76\n) for anticipated interest and penalty was included on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, compared with accrual benefit of $(\n95\n) as of year-end 2020. Income tax expense (benefit) associated with interest and penalties was $\n19\n, $(\n124\n) and $(\n3\n) in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNote 18\nProperties, Plant and Equipment\n1\n1\nOther than the United States and Australia, no other country accounted for 10 percent or more of the company’s net properties, plant and equipment (PP&E) in 2021. Australia had PP&E of\n$\n46,395\n,\n$\n48,060\nand $\n51,359\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Gross Investment at Cost, Net Investment and Additions at Cost for 2020 each include $\n16,703\nassociated with the Noble acquisition.\n2\nNet of dry hole expense related to prior years’ expenditures of $\n35\n, $\n709\nand $\n49\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n3\nDepreciation expense includes accretion expense\nof $\n616\n,\n$\n560\nand $\n628\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, and impairments\nof $\n414\n,\n$\n2,792\nand $\n10,797\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n82\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 19\nShort-Term Debt\nRedeemable long-term obligations consist primarily of tax-exempt variable-rate put bonds that are included as current liabilities because they become redeemable at the option of the bondholders during the year following the balance sheet date.\nThe company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps on a portion of its short-term debt. At December 31, 2021, the company had no interest rate swaps on short-term debt.\nAt December 31, 2021, the company had $\n10,075\nin\n364\n-day committed credit facilities with various major banks that enable the refinancing of short-term obligations on a long-term basis. The credit facilities allow the company to convert any amounts outstanding into a term loan for a period of up to one year. This supports commercial paper borrowing and can also be used for general corporate purposes. The company’s practice has been to continually replace expiring commitments with new commitments on substantially the same terms, maintaining levels management believes appropriate. Any borrowings under the facility would be unsecured indebtedness at interest rates based on the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), or Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) when LIBOR has permanently or indefinitely ceased or is no longer representative, or an average of base lending rates published by specified banks and on terms reflecting the company’s strong credit rating.\nNo\nborrowings were outstanding under this facility at December 31, 2021.\nThe company classified $\n7,759\nand $\n9,825\nof short-term debt as long-term at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Settlement of these obligations is not expected to require the use of working capital within one year, and the company has both the intent and the ability, as evidenced by committed credit facilities, to refinance them on a long-term basis.\n83\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 20\nLong-Term Debt\nTotal long-term debt including finance lease liabilities at December 31, 2021, was $\n31,113\n.\nThe company’s long-term debt outstanding at year-end 2021 and 2020 was as follows:\nChevron has an automatic shelf registration statement that expires in August 2023. This registration statement is for an unspecified amount of nonconvertible debt securities issued or guaranteed by Chevron Corporation or CUSA.\nLong-term debt excluding finance lease liabilities with a principal balance of $\n27,141\nmatures as follows: 2022 – $\n4,946\n; 2023 – $\n5,785\n; 2024 – $\n1,697\n; 2025 – $\n4,082\n; 2026 – $\n2,250\n; and after 2026 – $\n8,381\n.\nIn addition to the $\n2.6\nbillion in long-term debt that matured in 2021, the company also completed a tender offer in October 2021, with the objective of lowering future interest expenses, and redeemed bonds with a face value of $\n2.6\nbillion and a book value of $\n3.4\nbillion (including the fair market valuation adjustment for debt acquired in the Noble Energy acquisition), which resulted in an after-tax loss on the extinguishment of debt of $\n260\nmillion. The company also repaid $\n1.1\nbillion of bank loans associated with the NBLX acquisition during 2021.\nIn February 2022, the company early-redeemed $\n1.4\nbillion in notes at face value that were scheduled to mature in March 2022.\nSee\nfor information concerning the fair value of the company’s long-term debt.\n84\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 21\nAccounting for Suspended Exploratory Wells\nThe company continues to capitalize exploratory well costs after the completion of drilling when the well has found a sufficient quantity of reserves to justify completion as a producing well, and the business unit is making sufficient progress assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project. If either condition is not met or if the company obtains information that raises substantial doubt about the economic or operational viability of the project, the exploratory well would be assumed to be impaired, and its costs, net of any salvage value, would be charged to expense.\nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s suspended exploratory well costs for the three years ended December 31, 2021:\n*\n2020 represents fair value of well costs acquired in the Noble acquisition. 2019 represents property sales.\nThe following table provides an aging of capitalized well costs and the number of projects for which exploratory well costs have been capitalized for a period greater than one year since the completion of drilling.\n*\nCertain projects have multiple wells or fields or both.\nOf the $\n2,044\nof exploratory well costs capitalized for more than one year at December 31, 2021, $\n1,119\nis related to\nnine\nprojects that had drilling activities underway or firmly planned for the near future. The $\n925\nbalance is related to\nsix\nprojects in areas requiring a major capital expenditure before production could begin and for which additional drilling efforts were not underway or firmly planned for the near future. Additional drilling was not deemed necessary because the presence of hydrocarbons had already been established, and other activities were in process to enable a future decision on project development.\nThe projects for the $\n925\nreferenced above had the following activities associated with assessing the reserves and the projects’ economic viability: (a) $\n486\n(\nfour\nprojects) – undergoing front-end engineering and design with final investment decision expected within\nfour years\n; (b) $\n439\n(\ntwo\nprojects) – development alternatives under review. While progress was being made on all\n15\nprojects, the decision on the recognition of proved reserves under SEC rules in some cases may not occur for several years because of the complexity, scale and negotiations associated with the projects. More than half of these decisions are expected to occur in the next\nfive years\n.\nThe $\n2,044\nof suspended well costs capitalized for a period greater than one year as of December 31, 2021, represents\n83\nexploratory wells in\n15\nprojects. The tables below contain the aging of these costs on a well and project basis:\n85\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nNote 22\nStock Options and Other Share-Based Compensation\nCompensation expense for stock options for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n60\n($\n47\nafter tax), $\n94\n($\n74\nafter tax) and $\n81\n($\n64\nafter tax), respectively. In addition, compensation expense for stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, performance shares and restricted stock units was $\n701\n($\n554\nafter tax), $\n96\n($\n76\nafter tax) and $\n313\n($\n266\nafter tax) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. No significant stock-based compensation cost was capitalized at December 31, 2021, or December 31, 2020.\nCash received in payment for option exercises under all share-based payment arrangements for 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n1,274\n, $\n226\nand $\n1,090\n, respectively. Actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions from option exercises were $(\n15\n), $\n8\nand $\n43\nfor 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nCash paid to settle performance shares, restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights was $\n163\n, $\n95\nand $\n119\nfor 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Cash paid in 2021 included $\n4\nmillion for Noble awards paid under change-in-control plan provisions.\nAwards under the Chevron Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) may take the form of, but are not limited to, stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, stock appreciation rights, performance shares and nonstock grants. From April 2004 through May 2023, no more than\n260\nmillion shares may be issued under the LTIP. For awards issued on or after May 29, 2013, no more than\n50\nmillion of those shares may be in a form other than a stock option, stock appreciation right or award requiring full payment for shares by the award recipient. For the major types of awards issued before January 1, 2017, the contractual terms vary between\nthree years\nfor the performance shares and restricted stock units, and\n10\nyears for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. For awards issued after January 1, 2017, contractual terms vary between\nthree years\nfor the performance shares and special restricted stock units,\nfive years\nfor standard restricted stock units and\n10\nyears for the stock options and stock appreciation rights. Forfeitures for performance shares, restricted stock units, and stock appreciation rights are recognized as they occur. Forfeitures for stock options are estimated using historical forfeiture data dating back to 1990.\nNoble Share-Based Plans (Noble Plans)\nWhen Chevron acquired Noble in October 2020, outstanding stock options granted under various Noble Plans were exchanged for Chevron options. These awards retained the same provision as the original Noble Plans. Awards issued may be exercised for up to\nfive years\nafter termination of employment, depending upon the termination type, or the original expiration date, whichever is earlier. Other awards issued under the Noble Plans included restricted stock awards, restricted stock units, and performance shares, which retained the same provisions as the original Noble Plans. Upon termination of employment due to change-in-control, all unvested awards issued under the Noble Plans, including stock options, restricted stock awards, restricted stock units and performance shares become vested on the termination date. If not exercised, awards will expire between 2022 and 2029.\nFair Value and Assumptions\nThe fair market values of stock options and stock appreciation rights granted in 2021, 2020 and 2019 were measured on the date of grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model, with the following weighted-average assumptions:\n1\nExpected term is based on historical exercise and post-vesting cancellation data.\n2\nVolatility rate is based on historical stock prices over an appropriate period, generally equal to the expected term.\nA summary of option activity during 2021 is presented below:\n86\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe total intrinsic value (i.e., the difference between the exercise price and the market price) of options exercised during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n152\n, $\n92\nand $\n516\n, respectively. During this period, the company continued its practice of issuing treasury shares upon exercise of these awards.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there was $\n57\nof total unrecognized before-tax compensation cost related to nonvested share-based compensation arrangements granted under the plan. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\n1.7\nyears.\nAt January 1, 2021, the number of LTIP performance shares outstanding was equivalent to\n4,434,797\nshares. During 2021,\n2,219,379\nperformance shares were granted,\n1,378,766\nshares vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and\n252,345\nshares were forfeited. At December 31, 2021, there were\n5,023,065\nperformance shares outstanding that are payable in cash. The fair value of the liability recorded for these instruments was $\n683\nand was measured using the Monte Carlo simulation method.\nAt January 1, 2021, the number of restricted stock units outstanding was equivalent to\n3,303,933\nshares. During 2021,\n1,381,433\nrestricted stock units were granted,\n111,831\nunits vested with cash proceeds distributed to recipients and\n186,898\nunits were forfeited. At December 31, 2021, there were\n4,386,637\nrestricted stock units outstanding that are payable in cash. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $\n381\n, valued at the stock price as of December 31, 2021. In addition, outstanding stock appreciation rights that were granted under LTIP totaled approximately\n3.4\nmillion equivalent shares as of December 31, 2021. The fair value of the liability recorded for the vested portion of these instruments was $\n75\n.\nNote 23\nEmployee Benefit Plans\nThe company has defined benefit pension plans for many employees. The company typically prefunds defined benefit plans as required by local regulations or in certain situations where prefunding provides economic advantages. In the United States, all qualified plans are subject to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) minimum funding standard. The company does not typically fund U.S. nonqualified pension plans that are not subject to funding requirements under laws and regulations because contributions to these pension plans may be less economic and investment returns may be less attractive than the company’s other investment alternatives.\nThe company also sponsors other postretirement benefit (OPEB) plans that provide medical and dental benefits, as well as life insurance for some active and qualifying retired employees. The plans are unfunded, and the company and retirees share the costs. For the company’s main U.S. medical plan, the increase to the pre-Medicare company contribution for retiree medical coverage is limited to no more than\n4\npercent each year. Certain life insurance benefits are paid by the company.\nThe company recognizes the overfunded or underfunded status of each of its defined benefit pension and OPEB plans as an asset or liability on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\n87\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe funded status of the company’s pension and OPEB plans for 2021 and 2020 follows:\nAmounts recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet for the company’s pension and OPEB plans at December 31, 2021 and 2020, include:\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, the decrease in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial gains caused by higher discount rates used to value the obligations and large benefit payments paid to retirees in 2021. For the year ended December 31, 2020, the increase in benefit obligations was primarily due to actuarial losses caused by lower discount rates used to value the obligations.\nAmounts recognized on a before-tax basis in “Accumulated other comprehensive loss” for the company’s pension and OPEB plans were $\n4,979\nand $\n7,278\nat the end of 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts consisted of:\nThe accumulated benefit obligations for all U.S. and international pension plans were $\n11,337\nand $\n4,976\n, respectively, at December 31, 2021, and $\n13,608\nand $\n5,758\n, respectively, at December 31, 2020.\nInformation for U.S. and international pension plans with an accumulated benefit obligation in excess of plan assets at December 31, 2021 and 2020, was:\n88\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe components of net periodic benefit cost and amounts recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 are shown in the table below:\nAssumptions\nThe following weighted-average assumptions were used to determine benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs for years ended December 31:\nExpected Return on Plan Assets\nThe company’s estimated long-term rates of return on pension assets are driven primarily by actual historical asset-class returns, an assessment of expected future performance, advice from external actuarial firms and the incorporation of specific asset-class risk factors. Asset allocations are periodically updated using pension plan asset/liability studies, and the company’s estimated long-term rates of return are consistent with these studies. For 2021, the company used an expected long-term rate of return of\n6.50\npercent for U.S. pension plan assets, which account for\n67\npercent of the company’s pension plan assets.\nThe market-related value of assets of the main U.S. pension plan used in the determination of pension expense was based on the market values in the\nthree months\npreceding the year-end measurement date. Management considers the\nthree\n-month time period long enough to minimize the effects of distortions from day-to-day market volatility and still be contemporaneous to the end of the year. For other plans, market value of assets as of year-end is used in calculating the pension expense.\n89\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nDiscount Rate\nThe discount rate assumptions used to determine the U.S. and international pension and OPEB plan obligations and expense reflect the rate at which benefits could be effectively settled, and are equal to the equivalent single rate resulting from yield curve analysis. This analysis considered the projected benefit payments specific to the company’s plans and the yields on high-quality bonds. The projected cash flows were discounted to the valuation date using the yield curve for the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans. The effective discount rates derived from this analysis were\n2.8\npercent,\n2.4\npercent, and\n3.1\npercent for 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively, for both the main U.S. pension and OPEB plans.\nOther Benefit Assumptions\nFor the measurement of accumulated postretirement benefit obligation at December 31, 2021, for the main U.S. OPEB plan, the assumed health care cost-trend rates start with\n6.2\npercent in 2022 and gradually decline to\n4.5\npercent for 2031 and beyond. For this measurement at December 31, 2020, the assumed health care cost-trend rates started with\n6.1\npercent in 2021 and gradually declined to\n4.5\npercent for 2027 and beyond.\nPlan Assets and Investment Strategy\nThe fair value measurements of the company’s pension plans for 2021 and 2020 are as follows:\n1\nU.S. equities include investments in the company’s common stock in the amount of $\n0\nat December 31, 2021, and $\n4\nat December 31, 2020.\n2\nCollective Trusts/Mutual Funds for U.S. plans are entirely index funds; for International plans, they are mostly unit trust and index funds.\n3\nMixed funds are composed of funds that invest in both equity and fixed-income instruments in order to diversify and lower risk.\n4\nThe year-end valuations of the U.S. real estate assets are based on third-party appraisals that occur at least once a year for each property in the portfolio.\n5\nThe “Other” asset class includes net payables for securities purchased but not yet settled (Level 1); dividends and interest- and tax-related receivables (Level 2); insurance contracts (Level 3); and investments in private-equity limited partnerships (NAV).\n90\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nThe effects of fair value measurements using significant unobservable inputs on changes in Level 3 plan assets are outlined below:\nThe primary investment objectives of the pension plans are to achieve the highest rate of total return within prudent levels of risk and liquidity, to diversify and mitigate potential downside risk associated with the investments, and to provide adequate liquidity for benefit payments and portfolio management.\nThe company’s U.S. and U.K. pension plans comprise\n94\npercent of the total pension assets. Both the U.S. and U.K. plans have an Investment Committee that regularly meets during the year to review the asset holdings and their returns. To assess the plans’ investment performance, long-term asset allocation policy benchmarks have been established.\nFor the primary U.S. pension plan, the company’s Investment Committee has established the following approved asset allocation ranges: Equities\n40\n–\n65\npercent, Fixed Income\n20\n–\n40\npercent, Real Estate\n0\n–\n15\npercent, Alternative Investments\n0\n–\n5\npercent and Cash\n0\n–\n25\npercent. For the U.K. pension plan, the U.K. Board of Trustees has established the following asset allocation guidelines: Equities\n10\n–\n30\npercent, Fixed Income\n55\n–\n85\npercent, Real Estate\n5\n–\n15\npercent, and Cash\n0\n–\n5\npercent. The other significant international pension plans also have established maximum and minimum asset allocation ranges that vary by plan. Actual asset allocation within approved ranges is based on a variety of factors, including market conditions and illiquidity constraints. To mitigate concentration and other risks, assets are invested across multiple asset classes with active investment managers and passive index funds.\nThe company does not prefund its OPEB obligations.\nCash Contributions and Benefit Payments\nIn 2021, the company contributed $\n1,552\nand $\n199\nto its U.S. and international pension plans, respectively. In 2022, the company expects contributions to be approximately $\n1,100\nto its U.S. plans and $\n200\nto its international pension plans. Actual contribution amounts are dependent upon investment returns, changes in pension obligations, regulatory environments, tax law changes and other economic factors. Additional funding may ultimately be required if investment returns are insufficient to offset increases in plan obligations.\nThe company anticipates paying OPEB benefits of approximately $\n150\nin 2022; $\n146\nwas paid in 2021.\nThe following benefit payments, which include estimated future service, are expected to be paid by the company in the next 10 years:\nEmployee Savings Investment Plan\nEligible employees of Chevron and certain of its subsidiaries participate in the Chevron Employee Savings Investment Plan (ESIP). Compensation expense for the ESIP totaled $\n252\n, $\n281\nand $\n284\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n91\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nBenefit Plan Trusts\nPrior to its acquisition by Chevron, Texaco established a benefit plan trust for funding obligations under some of its benefit plans. At year-end 2021, the trust contained\n14.2\nmillion shares of Chevron treasury stock. The trust will sell the shares or use the dividends from the shares to pay benefits only to the extent that the company does not pay such benefits. The company intends to continue to pay its obligations under the benefit plans. The trustee will vote the shares held in the trust as instructed by the trust’s beneficiaries. The shares held in the trust are not considered outstanding for earnings-per-share purposes until distributed or sold by the trust in payment of benefit obligations.\nPrior to its acquisition by Chevron, Unocal established various grantor trusts to fund obligations under some of its benefit plans, including the deferred compensation and supplemental retirement plans. At December 31, 2021 and 2020, trust assets of $\n36\nand $\n36\n, respectively, were invested primarily in interest-earning accounts.\nEmployee Incentive Plans\nThe Chevron Incentive Plan is an annual cash bonus plan for eligible employees that links awards to corporate, business unit and individual performance in the prior year. Charges to expense for cash bonuses were $\n1,165\n, $\n462\nand $\n826\nin 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Chevron also has the LTIP for officers and other regular salaried employees of the company and its subsidiaries who hold positions of significant responsibility. Awards under the LTIP consist of stock options and other share-based compensation that are described in\n.\nNote 24\nOther Contingencies and Commitments\nIncome Taxes\nThe company calculates its income tax expense and liabilities quarterly. These liabilities generally are subject to audit and are not finalized with the individual taxing authorities until several years after the end of the annual period for which income taxes have been calculated. Refer to\nfor a discussion of the periods for which tax returns have been audited for the company’s major tax jurisdictions and a discussion for all tax jurisdictions of the differences between the amount of tax benefits recognized in the financial statements and the amount taken or expected to be taken in a tax return.\nSettlement of open tax years, as well as other tax issues in countries where the company conducts its businesses, are not expected to have a material effect on the consolidated financial position or liquidity of the company and, in the opinion of management, adequate provisions have been made for all years under examination or subject to future examination.\nGuarantees\nThe company has\none\nguarantee to an equity affiliate totaling $\n215\n. This guarantee is associated with certain payments under a terminal use agreement entered into by an equity affiliate. Over the approximate\n6\n-year remaining term of this guarantee, the maximum guarantee amount will be reduced as certain fees are paid by the affiliate. There are numerous cross-indemnity agreements with the affiliate and the other partners to permit recovery of amounts paid under the guarantee. Chevron has recorded no liability for this guarantee.\nIndemnifications\nIn the acquisition of Unocal, the company assumed certain indemnities relating to contingent environmental liabilities associated with assets that were sold in 1997. The acquirer of those assets shared in certain environmental remediation costs up to a maximum obligation of $\n200\n, which had been reached at December 31, 2009. Under the indemnification agreement, after reaching the $\n200\nobligation, Chevron is solely responsible until April 2022, when the indemnification expires. The environmental conditions or events that are subject to these indemnities must have arisen prior to the sale of the assets in 1997.\nAlthough the company has provided for known obligations under this indemnity that are probable and reasonably estimable, the amount of additional future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized. The company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nLong-Term Unconditional Purchase Obligations and Commitments, Including Throughput and Take-or-Pay Agreements\nThe company and its subsidiaries have certain contingent liabilities with respect to long-term unconditional purchase obligations and commitments, including throughput and take-or-pay agreements, some of which may relate to suppliers’ financing arrangements. The agreements typically provide goods and services, such as pipeline and storage capacity, utilities, and petroleum products, to be used or sold in the ordinary course of the company’s business. The aggregate amounts of required payments under throughput and take-or-pay agreements are: 2022 – $\n1,049\n; 2023 – $\n1,106\n; 2024 – $\n1,119\n; 2025 – $\n1,193\n; 2026 – $\n1,223\n; after 2026 – $\n7,626\n. The aggregate amount of required payments for other unconditional purchase obligations are: 2022 – $\n57\n; 2023 – $\n257\n; 2024 – $\n242\n; 2025 – $\n252\n; 2026 – $\n200\n; after 2026 –\n92\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n$\n282\n. A portion of these commitments may ultimately be shared with project partners. Total payments under the agreements were $\n861\nin 2021, $\n514\nin 2020 and $\n836\nin 2019.\nEnvironmental\nThe company is subject to loss contingencies pursuant to laws, regulations, private claims and legal proceedings related to environmental matters that are subject to legal settlements or that in the future may require the company to take action to correct or ameliorate the effects on the environment of prior release of chemicals or petroleum substances by the company or other parties. Such contingencies may exist for various operating, closed and divested sites, including, but not limited to, U.S. federal Superfund sites and analogous sites under state laws, refineries, chemical plants, marketing facilities, crude oil fields, and mining sites.\nAlthough the company has provided for known environmental obligations that are probable and reasonably estimable, it is likely that the company will continue to incur additional liabilities. The amount of additional future costs are not fully determinable due to such factors as the unknown magnitude of possible contamination, the unknown timing and extent of the corrective actions that may be required, the determination of the company’s liability in proportion to other responsible parties, and the extent to which such costs are recoverable from third parties. These future costs may be material to results of operations in the period in which they are recognized, but the company does not expect these costs will have a material effect on its consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nChevron’s environmental reserve as of December 31, 2021, was $\n960\n. Included in this balance was $\n230\nrelated to remediation activities at approximately\n145\nsites for which the company had been identified as a potentially responsible party under the provisions of the U.S. federal Superfund law or analogous state laws which provide for joint and several liability for all responsible parties. Any future actions by regulatory agencies to require Chevron to assume other potentially responsible parties’ costs at designated hazardous waste sites are not expected to have a material effect on the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nOf the remaining year-end 2021 environmental reserves balance of $\n730\n, $\n466\nis related to the company’s U.S. downstream operations, $\n50\nto its international downstream operations, and $\n214\nto its upstream operations. Liabilities at all sites were primarily associated with the company’s plans and activities to remediate soil or groundwater contamination or both.\nThe company manages environmental liabilities under specific sets of regulatory requirements, which in the United States include the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act and various state and local regulations. No single remediation site at year-end 2021 had a recorded liability that was material to the company’s results of operations, consolidated financial position or liquidity.\nRefer to\nfor a discussion of the company’s asset retirement obligations.\nOther Contingencies\nChevron receives claims from and submits claims to customers; trading partners; joint venture partners; U.S. federal, state and local regulatory bodies; governments; contractors; insurers; suppliers; and individuals. The amounts of these claims, individually and in the aggregate, may be significant and take lengthy periods to resolve, and may result in gains or losses in future periods.\nThe company and its affiliates also continue to review and analyze their operations and may close, retire, sell, exchange, acquire or restructure assets to achieve operational or strategic benefits and to improve competitiveness and profitability. These activities, individually or together, may result in significant gains or losses in future periods.\nNote 25\nAsset Retirement Obligations\nThe company records the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation (ARO) both as an asset and a liability when there is a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long-lived asset and the liability can be reasonably estimated. The legal obligation to perform the asset retirement activity is unconditional, even though uncertainty may exist about the timing and/or method of settlement that may be beyond the company’s control. This uncertainty about the timing and/or method of settlement is factored into the measurement of the liability when sufficient information exists to reasonably estimate fair value. Recognition of the ARO includes: (1) the present value of a liability and offsetting asset, (2) the subsequent accretion of that liability and depreciation of the asset, and (3) the periodic review of the ARO liability estimates and discount rates.\nAROs are primarily recorded for the company’s crude oil and natural gas producing assets. No significant AROs associated with any legal obligations to retire downstream long-lived assets have been recognized, as indeterminate settlement dates\n93\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nfor the asset retirements prevent estimation of the fair value of the associated ARO. The company performs periodic reviews of its downstream long-lived assets for any changes in facts and circumstances that might require recognition of a retirement obligation.\nThe following table indicates the changes to the company’s before-tax asset retirement obligations in 2021, 2020 and 2019:\nIn the table above, the amount associated with “Revisions in estimated cash flows” in 2021 primarily reflects increased cost estimates and scope changes to decommission wells, equipment and facilities. The long-term portion of the $\n12,808\nbalance at the end of 2021 was $\n11,611\n.\nNote 26\nRevenue\nRevenue from contracts with customers is presented in “Sales and other operating revenue” along with some activity that is accounted for outside the scope of Accounting Standard Codification (ASC) 606, which is not material to this line, on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Purchases and sales of inventory with the same counterparty that are entered into in contemplation of one another (including buy/sell arrangements) are combined and recorded on a net basis and reported in “Purchased crude oil and products” on the Consolidated Statement of Income. Refer to\nfor additional information on the company’s segmentation of revenue.\nReceivables related to revenue from contracts with customers are included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, net of the allowance for doubtful accounts. The net balance of these receivables was $\n12,877\nand $\n7,631\nat December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively. Other items included in “Accounts and notes receivable, net” represent amounts due from partners for their share of joint venture operating and project costs and amounts due from others, primarily related to derivatives, leases, buy/sell arrangements and product exchanges, which are accounted for outside the scope of ASC 606\n.\nContract assets and related costs are reflected in “Prepaid expenses and other current assets” and contract liabilities are reflected in “Accrued liabilities” and “Deferred credits and other noncurrent obligations” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Amounts for these items are not material to the company’s financial position.\nNote 27\nOther Financial Information\nEarnings in 2021 included after-tax gains of approximately $\n785\nrelating to the sale of certain properties. Of this amount, approximately $\n30\nand $\n755\nrelated to downstream and upstream, respectively. Earnings in 2020 included after-tax gains of approximately $\n765\nrelating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $\n30\nand $\n735\nrelated to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2019 included after-tax gains of approximately $\n1,500\nrelating to the sale of certain properties, of which approximately $\n50\nand $\n1,450\nrelated to downstream and upstream assets, respectively. Earnings in 2021 included after-tax charges of approximately $\n519\nfor pension settlement costs, $\n260\nfor early retirement of debt, $\n120\nrelating to upstream remediation and $\n110\nrelating to downstream legal reserves. Earnings in 2020 included after-tax charges of approximately $\n4,800\nfor impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream. Earnings in 2019 included after-tax charges of approximately $\n10,400\nfor impairments and other asset write-offs related to upstream.\n94\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\n*\nIncludes $\n180\n, $(\n152\n) and $(\n28\n) in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, for the company’s share of equity affiliates’ foreign currency effects.\nThe company has $\n4,385\nin goodwill on the Consolidated Balance Sheet, all of which is in the upstream segment and primarily related to the 2005 acquisition of Unocal. The company tested this goodwill for impairment during 2021, and\nno\nimpairment was required.\nNote 28\nFinancial Instruments - Credit Losses\nChevron’s expected credit loss allowance balance was $\n745\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and $\n671\nmillion as of December 31, 2020, with a majority of the allowance relating to non-trade receivable balances.\nThe majority of the company’s receivable balance is concentrated in trade receivables, with a balance of $\n16.4\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, which reflects the company’s diversified sources of revenues and is dispersed across the company’s broad worldwide customer base. As a result, the company believes the concentration of credit risk is limited. The company routinely assesses the financial strength of its customers. When the financial strength of a customer is not considered sufficient, alternative risk mitigation measures may be deployed, including requiring prepayments, letters of credit or other acceptable forms of collateral. Once credit is extended and a receivable balance exists, the company applies a quantitative calculation to current trade receivable balances that reflects credit risk predictive analysis, including probability of default and loss given default, which takes into consideration current and forward-looking market data as well as the company’s historical loss data. This statistical approach becomes the basis of the company’s expected credit loss allowance for current trade receivables with payment terms that are typically short-term in nature, with most due in less than 90 days.\nChevron’s non-trade receivable balance was $\n3.4\nbillion as of December 31, 2021, which includes receivables from certain governments in their capacity as joint venture partners. Joint venture partner balances that are paid as per contract terms or not yet due are subject to the statistical analysis described above while past due balances are subject to additional qualitative management quarterly review. This management review includes review of reasonable and supportable repayment forecasts. Non-trade receivables also include employee and tax receivables that are deemed immaterial and low risk. Loans to equity affiliates and non-equity investees are also considered non-trade and associated allowances of $\n560\nmillion are included within “Investments and Advances” on the Consolidated Balance Sheet at both December 31, 2021 and December 30, 2020.\nNote 29\nAcquisition of Noble Energy, Inc.\nOn October 5, 2020, the company acquired Noble Energy, Inc., an independent oil and gas exploration and production company. Noble’s principal upstream operations are in the United States, the Eastern Mediterranean and West Africa. Noble’s operations also include an integrated midstream business in the United States. The acquisition of Noble provides the company with low-cost proved reserves, attractive undeveloped resources and cash-generating assets.\nThe aggregate purchase price of Noble was $\n4,109\n, with approximately\n58\nmillion shares of Chevron common stock issued as consideration in the transaction, representing approximately 3 percent of shares of Chevron common stock outstanding immediately after the acquisition. As part of the transaction, the company recognized long-term debt and finance leases with a fair value of $\n9,231\n.\nThe acquisition was accounted for as a business combination under ASC 805, which requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be measured at their acquisition date fair values. Provisional fair value measurements were made for acquired assets and liabilities, and adjustments to those measurements may be made in subsequent periods, up to one year from the acquisition date, as information necessary to complete the analysis is obtained. Oil and gas properties were valued using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporated internally generated price assumptions and production profiles together\n95\nNotes to the Consolidated Financial Statements\nMillions of dollars, except per-share amounts\nwith appropriate operating cost and development cost assumptions. Debt assumed in the acquisition was valued based on observable market prices for Noble’s debt. As a result of measuring the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at fair value, there was no goodwill or bargain purchase recognized.\nThe following table summarizes the values assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed:\nThe following unaudited pro forma summary presents the results of operations as if the acquisition of Noble had occurred January 1, 2019:\nThe pro forma summary uses estimates and assumptions based on information available at the time. Management believes the estimates and assumptions to be reasonable; however, actual results may differ significantly from this pro forma financial information. The pro forma information does not reflect any synergistic savings that might be achieved from combining the operations and is not intended to reflect the actual results that would have occurred had the companies actually been combined during the periods presented.\n96\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nIn accordance with FASB and SEC disclosure requirements for oil and gas producing activities, this section provides supplemental information on oil and gas exploration and producing activities of the company in seven separate tables. Tables I through IV provide historical cost information pertaining to costs incurred in exploration, property acquisitions and development; capitalized costs; and results of operations.

The company classifies discovered recoverable hydrocarbons into six categories based on their status at the time of reporting – three deemed commercial and three potentially recoverable. Within the commercial classification are proved reserves and two categories of unproved reserves: probable and possible. The potentially recoverable categories are also referred to as contingent resources. For reserves estimates to be classified as proved, they must meet all SEC and company standards.\nProved oil and gas reserves are the estimated quantities that geoscience and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be economically producible in the future from known reservoirs under existing economic conditions, operating methods and government regulations. Net proved reserves exclude royalties and interests owned by others and reflect contractual arrangements and royalty obligations in effect at the time of the estimate.\nProved reserves are classified as either developed or undeveloped. Proved developed reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods, or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well. Proved undeveloped reserves are the quantities expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion.\nDue to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to change as additional information becomes available.\n101\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nProved reserves are estimated by company asset teams composed of earth scientists and engineers. As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, the company maintains a Reserves Advisory Committee (RAC) that is chaired by the Manager of Global Reserves, an organization that is separate from the upstream operating organization. The Manager of Global Reserves has more than 30 years of experience working in the oil and gas industry and holds both undergraduate and graduate degrees in geoscience. His experience includes various technical and management roles in providing reserve and resource estimates in support of major capital and exploration projects, and more than 10 years of overseeing oil and gas reserves processes. He has been named a Distinguished Lecturer by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists and is an active member of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists, the SEPM Society of Sedimentary Geologists and the Society of Petroleum Engineers.\nAll RAC members are degreed professionals, each with more than 10 years of experience in various aspects of reserves estimation relating to reservoir engineering, petroleum engineering, earth science or finance. The members are knowledgeable in SEC guidelines for proved reserves classification and receive annual training on the preparation of reserves estimates.\nThe RAC has the following primary responsibilities: establish the policies and processes used within the business units to estimate reserves; provide independent reviews and oversight of the business units’ recommended reserves estimates and changes; confirm that proved reserves are recognized in accordance with SEC guidelines; determine that reserve quantities are calculated using consistent and appropriate standards, procedures and technology; and maintain the\nChevron Corporation Reserves Manual\n,\nwhich provides standardized procedures used corporatewide for classifying and reporting hydrocarbon reserves.\nDuring the year, the RAC is represented in meetings with each of the company’s upstream business units to review and discuss reserve changes recommended by the various asset teams. Major changes are also reviewed with the company’s senior leadership team including the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer. The company’s annual reserve activity is also reviewed with the Board of Directors. If major changes to reserves were to occur between the annual reviews, those matters would also be discussed with the Board.\nRAC subteams also conduct in-depth reviews during the year of many of the fields that have large proved reserves quantities. These reviews include an examination of the proved reserve records and documentation of their compliance with the\nChevron Corporation Reserves Manual\n.\nTechnologies Used in Establishing Proved Reserves Additions\nIn 2021, additions to Chevron’s proved reserves were based on a wide range of geologic and engineering technologies. Information generated from wells, such as well logs, wire line sampling, production and pressure testing, fluid analysis, and core analysis, was integrated with seismic data, regional geologic studies, and information from analogous reservoirs to provide “reasonably certain” proved reserves estimates. Both proprietary and commercially available analytic tools, including reservoir simulation, geologic modeling and seismic processing, have been used in the interpretation of the subsurface data. These technologies have been utilized extensively by the company in the past, and the company believes that they provide a high degree of confidence in establishing reliable and consistent reserves estimates.\nProved Undeveloped Reserves\nNoteworthy changes in proved undeveloped reserves are shown in the table below and discussed on the following page.\nIn 2021, revisions include an increase of 202 million BOE in Australia, primarily from the approval of the Jansz Io Compression project (Gorgon and Jansz Io make up the Gorgon Project). In the United States, there was a net increase of 192 million BOE primarily from the Midland and Delaware basins, where 105 million BOE was attributed to improved commodity price environment, and performance revisions, and 91 million BOE associated with the Anchor Project in the Gulf of Mexico due to improved commodity price. In Bangladesh, there was an increase of 30 million BOE, primarily from\n102\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nthe approval of the Bibiyana Optimization Project and entitlement effects. These increases were partially offset by a decrease of 339 million BOE in Kazakhstan, primarily at TCO, which includes entitlement effects, changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model changes and changes to the FGP/WPMP schedule.\nIn 2021, extensions and discoveries of 630 million BOE in the United States were primarily due to the increase of activity and planned development of new locations in shale and tight assets in the Midland and Delaware basins.\nThe difference in 2021 extensions and discoveries of 149 million BOE, between the net quantities of proved reserves of 807 million BOE as reflected on pages 105 to 107 and net quantities of proved undeveloped reserves of 658 million BOE, is primarily due to proved Extensions and Discoveries that were not recognized as proved undeveloped reserves in the prior year and were recognized directly as proved developed reserves in 2021.\nPurchases of 36 million BOE in 2021 are from the acquisition of various properties in the Midland and Delaware basins in the United States.\nTransfers to proved developed reserves in 2021 include 245 million BOE in the United States, primarily from the Midland, Delaware and DJ basin developments and 125 million BOE in Equatorial Guinea, Canada, and other international locations. These transfers are the consequence of development expenditures on completing wells and facilities.\nDuring 2021, investments totaling approximately $6.6\nbillion in oil and gas producing activities and about $0.1 billion in non-oil and gas producing activities were expended to advance the development of proved undeveloped reserves. The United States accounted for about $2.8 billion related primarily to various development activities in the Midland and Delaware basins and the Gulf of Mexico. In Asia, expenditures during the year totaled approximately $2.5 billion, primarily related to development projects of TCO in Kazakhstan. An additional $0.4 billion were spent on development activities in Australia. In Africa, about $0.4 billion was expended on various offshore development and natural gas projects in Nigeria, Angola and Republic of Congo. Development activities in Canada and other international locations were primarily responsible for about $0.5 billion of expenditures.\nReserves that remain proved undeveloped for five or more years are a result of several factors that affect optimal project development and execution. These factors may include the complex nature of the development project in adverse and remote locations, physical limitations of infrastructure or plant capacities that dictate project timing, compression projects that are pending reservoir pressure declines, and contractual limitations that dictate production levels.\nAt year-end 2021, the company held approximately 1.6 billion BOE of proved undeveloped reserves that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. The majority of these reserves are in locations where the company has a proven track record of developing major projects. In Australia, approximately 400 million BOE remain undeveloped for five years or more related to the Gorgon and Wheatstone Projects. Further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with operating constraints and infrastructure optimization. In Africa, approximately 200 million BOE have remained undeveloped for five years or more, primarily due to facility constraints at various fields and infrastructure associated with the Escravos gas projects in Nigeria. Affiliates account for about 950 million BOE of proved undeveloped reserves with about 900 million BOE that have remained undeveloped for five years or more. Approximately 800 million BOE are related to TCO in Kazakhstan and about 100 million BOE are related to Angola LNG. At TCO and Angola LNG, further field development to convert the remaining proved undeveloped reserves is scheduled to occur in line with reservoir depletion and facility constraints.\nAnnually, the company assesses whether any changes have occurred in facts or circumstances, such as changes to development plans, regulations, or government policies, that would warrant a revision to reserve estimates. In 2021, improvements in commodity prices positively impacted the economic limits of oil and gas properties, resulting in proved reserve increases, and negatively impacted proved reserves due to entitlement effects. The year-end reserves quantities have been updated for these circumstances and significant changes have been discussed in the appropriate reserves sections. Over the past three years, the ratio of proved undeveloped reserves to total proved reserves has ranged between 31 percent and 35 percent.\nProved Reserve Quantities\nFor the three years ending December 31, 2021, the pattern of net reserve changes shown in the following tables are not necessarily indicative of future trends. Apart from acquisitions, the company’s ability to add proved reserves can be affected by events and circumstances that are outside the company’s control, such as delays in government permitting, partner approvals of development plans, changes in oil and gas prices, OPEC constraints, geopolitical uncertainties, and civil unrest.\n103\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nAt December 31, 2021, proved reserves for the company were 11.3 billion BOE. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of liquids including crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil for the years 2019, 2020 and 2021 are shown in the table on page 105. The company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas liquids are shown on page 106 and the company’s estimated net proved reserves of natural gas are shown on page 107.\nNoteworthy changes in crude oil, condensate and synthetic oil proved reserves for 2019 through 2021 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\nRevisions\nIn 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted away from reservoirs with higher gas-to-oil ratios and lower execution efficiencies, and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin, were primarily responsible for the 153 million barrels decrease in the United States. Operational issues with the Petropiar upgrader in Venezuela resulted in a decrease in reserves of synthetic oil of 126 million barrels and an increase of crude oil and condensate reserves of 105 million barrels. Reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for the 75 million barrels increase at TCO in Kazakhstan. Improved field performance at various fields, including Moho-Bilondo in the Republic of Congo, Mafumeira in Angola, and Sonam in Nigeria, were responsible for the 42 million barrels increase in Africa.\nIn 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in the Midland and Delaware basins and Anchor in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 279 million barrels decrease in the United States. Reserves in Venezuela affiliates decreased by 149 million barrels, primarily due to impairments and accounting methodology change. Entitlement effects and performance revisions in TCO were primarily responsible for the 180 million barrels increase. Entitlement effects primarily contributed to an increase of 77 million barrels synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands in Canada and 74 million barrels at multiple locations in Asia.\nIn 2021, the 206 million barrels increase in United States was primarily in the Gulf of Mexico and the Midland and Delaware basins. The higher commodity price environment led to the increase of 126 million barrels in the Gulf of Mexico primarily from Anchor and a 68 million barrels increase in Midland and Delaware basins due to higher planned development activity.\nIn TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily responsible for the 208 million barrels decrease in Kazakhstan. Entitlement effects primarily contributed to a decrease of 106 million barrels of synthetic oil at the Athabasca Oil Sands project in Canada. In the Other Americas, performance revisions and price effects, mainly in Canada and Argentina, were primarily responsible for the 41 million barrels increase.\nExtensions and Discoveries\nIn 2019, portfolio optimizations, where future drilling in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins is being targeted towards liquids-rich reservoirs with higher execution efficiencies, and extensions and discoveries in the deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 394 million barrels increase in the United States. Extensions and discoveries in Loma Campana in Argentina were primarily responsible for the 39 million barrels increase in Other Americas.\nIn 2020, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 105 million barrels increase in the United States.\nIn 2021, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins, and at the Whale Project in the Gulf of Mexico, were primarily responsible for the 349 million barrels increase in the United States.\nPurchases\nIn 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 227 million barrels in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins in the United States.\nSales\nIn 2019, sales of 69 million barrels in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.\nIn 2020, sales of 99 million barrels in Asia were in Azerbaijan.\nIn 2021, sales of 32 million barrels in the United States were in the Midland and Delaware basins.\n104\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nNet Proved Reserves of Crude Oil, Condensate and Synthetic Oil\n1\nEnding reserve balances in North America were 183, 166 and 230 and in South America were 105, 94 and 90 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2\nReserves associated with Canada.\n3\nEnding reserve balances in Africa were 4, 3 and 3 and in South America were 0, 0 and 156 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n4\nIncluded are year-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC) (refer to page E-7 for the definition of a PSC). PSC-related reserve quantities are 7 percent, 9 percent and 11 percent for consolidated companies for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoteworthy changes in natural gas liquids proved reserves for 2019 through 2021 are discussed below and shown in the table on the following page:\nRevisions\nIn 2019, portfolio optimizations and low price realizations in various fields in the Midland and Delaware basins and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin were mainly responsible for the 120 million barrels decrease in the United States.\nIn 2020, capital reductions and commodity price effects in various fields in Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 71 million barrels decrease in the United States.\nIn 2021, higher commodity prices resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 107 million barrels increase in the United States.\nExtensions and Discoveries\nIn 2019, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins and deepwater fields in the Gulf of Mexico were primarily responsible for the 140 million barrels increase in the United States.\nIn 2020, extensions and discoveries in various fields in Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 60 million barrels increase in the United States.\nIn 2021, extensions and discoveries in the Midland and Delaware basins were primarily responsible for the 190 million barrels increase in the United States.\nPurchases\nIn 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 198 million barrels primarily in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins and Eagle Ford Shale in the United States.\n105\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nNet Proved Reserves of Natural Gas Liquids\n1\nReserves associated with North America.\n2\nReserves associated with Africa.\n3\nYear-end reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC) (refer to page E-7 for the definition of a PSC) are not material for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNoteworthy changes in natural gas proved reserves for 2019 through 2021 are discussed below and shown in the table above:\nRevisions\nIn 2019, strong performances at Wheatstone and the greater Gorgon areas were mainly responsible for 1.7 TCF increase in Australia. At TCO in Kazakhstan, reservoir management and entitlement effects were mainly responsible for 223 BCF increase. Portfolio optimizations and low price realizations in various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins and planned divestments in the Appalachian basin were mainly responsible for the 2.6 TCF decrease in the United States.\nIn 2020, the demotion of Jansz Io compression project reserves and lower field performance, partially offset by positive revisions at Gorgon, were mainly responsible for the net 2.5 TCF decrease in Australia. Capital reductions and commodity price effects in various fields of the Midland and Delaware basins were mainly responsible for the 509 BCF decrease in the United States. In Africa, a 229 BCF decrease was primarily due to reduced demand and development plan changes at Meren in Nigeria.\nIn 2021, the approval of the Jansz Io Compression project was mainly responsible for the 1.2 TCF increase in Australia. Higher commodity prices, resulting in the increase of planned development activity in the Midland and Delaware basins, were mainly responsible for the 829 BCF increase in the United States. In TCO, entitlement effects and technical changes in field operating assumptions, reservoir model, and project schedule were primarily responsible for the 179 BCF decrease.\nExtensions and Discoveries\nIn 2019, extensions and discoveries of 1.0 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.\nIn 2020, extensions and discoveries of 385 BCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.\nIn 2021, extensions and discoveries of 1.4 TCF in the United States were primarily in the Midland and Delaware basins.\n106\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nPurchases\nIn 2020, the acquisition of Noble assets contributed 5.4 TCF in Israel in Asia, 1.5 TCF in the DJ basin, Midland and Delaware basins and Eagle Ford Shale in the United States and 441 BCF in Equatorial Guinea in Africa.\nSales\nIn 2019, sales of 240 BCF in Europe were in the United Kingdom and Denmark.\nIn 2020, sales of 1.3 TCF were primarily in the Appalachian basin in the United States and 264 BCF primarily in Azerbaijan in Asia.\nNet Proved Reserves of Natural Gas\n1\nEnding reserve balances in North America and South America were 347, 234 and 462 and 108, 95 and 274 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n2\nEnding reserve balances in Africa and South America were 893, 898 and 802 and 0, 0 and 64 in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n3\nTotal “as sold” volumes are 2,599, 2,447 and 2,379 for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n4\nIncludes reserve quantities related to production-sharing contracts (PSC) (refer to page E-7 for the definition of a PSC). PSC-related reserve quantities are 8 percent, 10 percent and 10 percent for consolidated companies for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n107\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nTable VI - Standardized Measure of Discounted Future Net Cash Flows Related to Proved Oil and Gas Reserves\nThe standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is calculated in accordance with SEC and FASB requirements. This includes using the average of first-day-of-the-month oil and gas prices for the 12-month period prior to the end of the reporting period, estimated future development and production costs assuming the continuation of existing economic conditions, estimated costs for asset retirement obligations (includes costs to retire existing wells and facilities in addition to those future wells and facilities necessary to produce proved undeveloped reserves), and estimated future income taxes based on appropriate statutory tax rates. Discounted future net cash flows are calculated using 10 percent mid-period discount factors. Estimates of proved reserve quantities are imprecise and change over time as new information becomes available. Probable and possible reserves, which may become proved in the future, are excluded from the calculations. The valuation requires assumptions as to the timing and amount of future development and production costs. The calculations are made as of December 31 each year and do not represent management’s estimate of the company’s future cash flows or value of its oil and gas reserves. In the following table, the caption “Standardized Measure Net Cash Flows” refers to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows.\n108\nSupplemental Information on Oil and Gas Producing Activities - Unaudited\nTable VII - Changes in the Standardized Measure\nof Discounted Future Net Cash Flows From Proved Reserves\nThe changes in present values between years, which can be significant, reflect changes in estimated proved reserve quantities and prices and assumptions used in forecasting production volumes and costs. Changes in the timing of production are included with “Revisions of previous quantity estimates.”\n109\nPART IV"
