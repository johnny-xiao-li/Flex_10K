    "text": "General Description of Business\nNordson is an innovative precision technology company that leverages a scalable growth framework to deliver top tier growth with leading margins and returns. We engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used for precision dispensing, applying and controlling of adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces and various medical products such as: catheters, cannulas, medical balloons and medical tubing. These products are supported with extensive application expertise and direct global sales and service. We serve a wide variety of consumer non-durable, consumer durable and technology end markets including packaging, electronics, medical, appliances, energy, transportation, building and construction, and general product assembly and finishing.\nOur strategy for long-term growth is based on solving customers’ needs globally. We were incorporated in the State of Ohio in 1954 and are headquartered in Westlake, Ohio. Our products are marketed through a network of direct operations in more than 35 countries. Consistent with this global strategy, approximately 67 percent of our revenues were generated outside the United States in 2022.\nWe have 7,331 employees worldwide. Our principal manufacturing facilities are located in the United States, the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nCyberOptics Acquisition\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of CyberOptics Corporation (“CyberOptics”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2022, by and among the Company, Meta Merger Company and CyberOptics. CyberOptics is\na leading global developer and manufacturer of high-precision 3D optical sensing technology solutions. The CyberOptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform, providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and will be reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment. The all-cash transaction of approximately $380,000, net of cash acquired, was funded using our revolving credit facility and is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCorporate Purpose and Goals\nWe strive to be a vital, self-renewing, worldwide organization that, within the framework of ethical behavior and enlightened citizenship, grows and produces wealth for our customers, employees, shareholders and communities.\nWe operate for the purpose of creating balanced, long-term benefits for all of our constituencies.\nWe focus on long-term growth and returns. Each quarter, we may not produce increased sales, net income, or earnings per share, or exceed the comparative prior year's quarter. When short-term swings occur, we do not intend to alter our foundational objectives in efforts to mitigate the impact of these temporary occurrences.\nIn 2021, we launched the Ascend strategy, which is designed to deliver top tier revenue growth with leading margins and returns. Ascend is driven by three interconnected pillars: the NBS (Nordson Business System) Next growth framework; Owner Mindset, our division-led organizational structure; and Winning Teams, our talent strategy. These three pillars are built upon the foundation of what makes Nordson special: our culture and our values.\nThe NBS Next growth framework, the heart of the Ascend strategy, uses data-based segmentation to identify our greatest opportunities for profitable growth and ensure we are investing our resources disproportionately in those areas. Using data in a consistent and disciplined way, leaders across the Company are defining their strategic business priorities.\nWe drive organic growth by continually introducing new products and technology, providing high levels of customer service and support, capturing rapidly expanding opportunities in emerging geographies, and leveraging existing technology into new applications. Additional growth comes through the acquisition of companies that have differentiated precision technology-based product portfolios, serve attractive high-growth end-markets applications and have a customer-centric business model. The\nNordson Corporation 4\nprimary goals of our acquisition strategy are to complement our current capabilities, diversify our business into new industry sectors with new customers and expand the scope of the solutions we can offer to our customers.\nWe strive to provide genuine customer satisfaction – it is the foundation upon which we continue to build our business.\nComplementing our business strategy is the objective to provide opportunities for employee self-fulfillment, growth, security, recognition and equitable compensation. This goal is met through the Human Resources department’s facilitation of employee training, leadership training and the creation of on-the-job growth opportunities. The result is a highly qualified and professional global team capable of meeting corporate objectives. For more information, see \"Human Capital Resources\" below.\nWe recognize the value of employee participation in the planning process. Strategic and operating plans are developed by all divisions, resulting in a sense of ownership and commitment on the part of employees in accomplishing our objectives.\nWe are an equal opportunity employer.\nAt Nordson, we have a long and proud history of investing in the communities where we live and work.\nWe are committed to contributing approximately five percent of domestic pretax earnings to education, human welfare services and other charitable activities, particularly in communities where we have significant operations. Through the Nordson Corporation Foundation (the “Foundation”), we give back by providing grants to nonprofits in communities where we have facilities employing approximately 100 people. In recent years, we have extended our reach internationally, with giving programs in 11 international locations. We also expanded our Matching Gifts program internationally in 2022, which further expands our culture of giving around the world. Since 1989, we have donated more than $148 million to communities where we live and work. In addition, our employees volunteered more than 107,000 hours through our Time ‘N Talent and Dollars for Doers programs.\nPrincipal Products and Uses\nWe engineer, manufacture and market differentiated products and systems used to dispense, apply and control adhesives, coatings, polymers, sealants, biomaterials, medical components, and other fluids, to test and inspect for quality, and to treat and cure surfaces. Our precision technology can be found in manufacturing facilities around the world producing a wide range of goods for consumer durable, consumer non-durable and technology end markets. Equipment ranges from single-use components to manual, stand-alone units for low-volume operations to microprocessor-based automated systems for high-speed, high-volume production lines.\nWe market our products globally, primarily through a direct sales force, and also through qualified distributors and sales representatives. We have built a worldwide reputation for creativity and expertise in the design and engineering of high-technology application equipment that meets the specific needs of our customers. We create value for our customers by developing solutions that increase uptime, enable faster line speeds and reduce consumption of materials. We serve a broad customer base, both in terms of industries and geographic regions. In 2022, no single customer accounted for ten percent or more of sales.\nThe following is a summary of the product lines and markets served by our operating segments:\nIndustrial Precision Solutions\nThis segment delivers proprietary dispensing and material processing technology, as well as measurement, inspection and control solutions to diverse end markets.

Key strategic markets include mobile phones, tablets, personal computers, wearable technology, liquid crystal displays, micro hard drives, microprocessors, printed circuit boards, flexible circuits, micro mechanical systems and semiconductor packaging.\nManufacturing, Raw Materials and Other Resources\nOur production operations include machining, molding and assembly. We manufacture specially designed parts and assemble components into finished equipment. Many components are made in standard modules that can be used in more than one product or in combination with other components for a variety of models. We have principal manufacturing operations and sources of supply in the United States in Ohio, Georgia, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island, Tennessee and Wisconsin; as well as in the People’s Republic of China, Germany, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom.\nPrincipal materials used to make our products are metals and plastics, typically in sheets, bar stock, castings, forgings, tubing and pellets. We also purchase many electrical and electronic components, fabricated metal parts, high-pressure fluid hoses, packings, seals and other items integral to our products. Suppliers are competitively selected based on cost, quality and service. Most significant raw materials that we use are available through multiple sources. We purchase most raw materials and other components on the open market and rely on third parties to provide certain finished goods. While these items are generally available from multiple sources, the cost of products sold may be affected by changes in the market price of raw materials and tariffs on certain raw materials, particularly imports from China, as well as disruptions in availability of raw materials, components and sourced finished goods.\nWe monitor and investigate alternative suppliers and materials based on numerous attributes including quality, service, financial stability and price. We currently source raw materials and components from a number of suppliers, but our ongoing efforts to improve the cost effectiveness of our products and services may result in a reduction in the number of our suppliers.\nNordson Corporation 6\nSenior operating management supervises an extensive quality control program for our equipment, machinery and systems, and manufacturing processes.\nNatural gas and other fuels are our primary energy sources. However, standby capacity for alternative sources is available if needed.\nThough the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the global supply chain, we have not experienced significant supply disruption from third-party component suppliers. However, we have faced and continue to face some supply chain constraints, primarily related to electronic component availability. While logistics flow continues to improve, we are experiencing much higher costs than pre-pandemic rates due to carrier rate increases, mode changes, fuel costs, port backlog and other factors. In addition, shipments between countries have been impacted and we have experienced delays due to a variety of factors related to supply chain disruption.\nIntellectual Property\nWe rely on a combination of intellectual property rights, including patents, trademarks, copyrights, trade secrets, and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property. Our worldwide intellectual property portfolio is strengthened through innovation and brand recognition, and our comprehensive approach for protection and enforcement. We enter into confidentiality and intellectual property agreements with our employees that require them to disclose any inventions created in the scope of employment, convey all rights to those inventions to us, and restrict the distribution of proprietary information. Risk factors associated with our intellectual property are discussed in Item 1A, \"Risk Factors\".\nWe protect and promote our intellectual property portfolio and take those actions we deem appropriate to enforce our intellectual property rights and to defend our rights to sell our products both domestically and internationally. Although in the aggregate, our global portfolio of more than 2,100 granted and pending patents and more than 1,000 trademarks are valuable assets that are important to our operations, we believe that our competitive advantage is also largely attributable to the technical, marketing, and sales competence and capabilities of our employees, rather than on any individual patent or trademark. Therefore, we do not consider the expiration or loss of any single patent, trademark, or intellectual property right, to be material to our business as a whole.\nSeasonal Variation in Business\nHistorically, the highest volume of sales occurs in the second half of the fiscal year due in large part to the timing of customers’ capital spending programs. Accordingly, fiscal first quarter sales volume is typically the lowest of the year due to timing of customers’ capital spending programs and customer holiday shutdowns. However, the COVID-19 pandemic, supply chain disruptions, historic backlog and other unusual events have impacted this historical trend to a degree.\nCompetitive Conditions\nWe operate in a competitive global marketplace and compete with many large, well-established and highly competitive manufacturers and service providers. Our business is affected by a range of macroeconomic conditions, including industry capacity changes, global competition and economic conditions in the U.S. and abroad, as well as fluctuations in currency exchange rates. Our equipment is sold in competition with a wide variety of alternative bonding, sealing, finishing, coating, processing, testing, inspecting and fluid control techniques. Potential uses for our equipment include any production processes that require preparation, modification or curing of surfaces; dispensing, application, processing or control of fluids and materials; or testing and inspecting for quality.\nMany factors influence our competitive position, including pricing, product quality and service. We maintain a leadership position in our business segments by delivering high-quality, innovative products and technologies, as well as global service and technical support. Working with customers to understand their processes and developing the application solutions that help them meet their production requirements also contributes to our leadership position. Our worldwide network of direct sales and technical resources also is a competitive advantage.\nCompliance with Governmental Regulations\nAs a U.S. public company that supports manufacturing, designing and servicing highly complex products in regulated environments, our global operations are subject to a variety of laws, regulations and compliance obligations. We have robust internal controls, quality management systems, and management systems of compliance that govern our internal actions and mitigate our risk of non-compliance. We also have safeguards established to identify non-compliance concerns through internal and external audits and risk assessments, as well as an ethics helpline reporting system.\nWe are also required to comply with increasingly complex and changing laws and regulations enacted to protect business and personal data in the United States and other jurisdictions regarding privacy, data protection and data security, including those\nNordson Corporation 7\nrelated to the collection, storage, use, transmission and protection of personal information and other consumer, customer, vendor or employee data. Such privacy and data protection laws and regulations, including with respect to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (\"GDPR\"), the Brazilian General Data Protection Law, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (\"CCPA\"), and the interpretation and enforcement of such laws and regulations, are continuously developing and evolving and there is significant uncertainty with respect to how compliance with these laws and regulations may evolve and the costs and complexity of future compliance.\nWe are also subject to federal, state, local and foreign environmental, safety and health laws and regulations concerning, among other things, emissions to the air, discharges to land and water and the generation, handling, treatment and disposal of hazardous waste and other materials. Under certain of these laws, we can be held strictly liable for hazardous substance contamination of any real property we have ever owned, operated or used as a disposal site or for natural resource damages associated with such contamination. We are also required to maintain various related permits and licenses, many of which require periodic modification and renewal. The operation of manufacturing plants unavoidably entails environmental, safety and health risks, and we could incur material unanticipated costs or liabilities in the future if any of these risks were realized in ways or to an extent that we did not anticipate.\nWe believe that we operate in compliance, in all material respects, with applicable environmental laws and regulations. Compliance with environmental laws and regulations requires continuing management effort and expenditures. We have incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures to comply with these laws and regulations and to obtain and maintain the necessary permits and licenses. We believe that the cost of complying with environmental laws and regulations will not have a material effect on our earnings, liquidity or competitive position but cannot assure that material compliance-related costs and expenses may not arise in the future. For example, future adoption of new or amended environmental laws, regulations or requirements or newly discovered contamination or other circumstances could require us to incur costs and expenses that may have a material effect, but cannot be presently anticipated.\nWe believe that policies, practices and procedures have been properly designed to prevent unreasonable risk of material environmental damage arising from our operations. We accrue for estimated environmental liabilities with charges to expense and believe our environmental accrual is adequate to provide for our portion of the costs of all such known environmental liabilities. Compliance with federal, state, local and foreign environmental protection laws during 2022 had no material effect on our capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position. Based upon consideration of currently available information, we believe liabilities for environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position, operating results or liquidity, but we cannot ensure that material environmental liabilities may not arise in the future.\nFor a discussion of the risks associated with these laws and regulations, see Part I, Item 1A, \"Risk Factors.\"\nHuman Capital Resources\nEmployee Profile\nAs of October 31, 2022, we had 7,331 full-time and part-time employees, including 128 at our Amherst, Ohio, facility who are represented by a collective bargaining agreement that expires on November 16, 2025.\nTotal Rewards\nAs part of our compensation philosophy, we believe that we must offer and maintain market competitive total rewards programs for our employees in order to attract and retain superior talent. These programs not only include base wages and incentives in support of our pay for performance culture, but also health, welfare and retirement benefits. We focus many programs on employee wellness and have implemented solutions including mental health support access, telemedicine and healthy weight loss programs. We believe that these solutions have helped us successfully manage healthcare and prescription drug costs for our employee population.\nIn the U.S., we match contributions to a tax-qualified defined contribution retirement savings plan (the “Savings Plan”) for all eligible employees, in an amount equal to 50 cents for every dollar contributed by the employee until the employee contributions reach 6% of her or his base compensation. In addition, non-union new hires and re-hires as of July 1, 2021 are eligible for an additional enhanced 401(k) contribution of 3% eligible earnings. All contributions by employees into the Savings Plan are fully vested immediately. Company contributions, both the match and enhanced contribution, have a three-year graded vesting schedule and vest at 33 1/3% each year until fully vested after three years of employment. We also maintain a non-qualified, unfunded and unsecured deferred compensation plan for the benefit of eligible management employees whose benefits under the Savings Plan are limited by the benefit restrictions of Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code. In addition, non-union employees hired prior to July 1, 2021 are eligible to participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the “Salaried Pension Plan”). The Salaried Pension Plan is designed to work together with social security benefits to provide employees with up to 30 years of service retirement income replacement that is approximately 55% of eligible compensation, subject to the Internal Revenue Code maximum monthly benefit. Participants fully vest in the Salaried\nNordson Corporation 8\nPension Plan after five years of service. All eligible union employees hired prior to November 1, 2004 participate in a Company-sponsored tax-qualified pension plan for U.S.-based employees (the “Hourly Pension Plan”). The Hourly Pension Plan provides a multiplier for each year of service to supplement employees’ retirement income. We also maintain a supplemental retirement benefit restoration plan (“Excess Defined Benefit Pension Plan”), which is an unfunded, non-qualified plan that is designed to provide retirement benefits to U.S.-based eligible participants hired prior to July 1, 2021, as a replacement for retirement benefits limited by regulations under the Internal Revenue Code.\nIn 2022, we launched a global recognition program that allows managers and peers to recognize the special achievements of others through both written recognition shared on a company awards feed, as well as monetary recognition that allows a recipient to choose a physical gift, gift card or donate the value of their recognition to charity. We also continue our service award program, which demonstrates appreciation and thanks to longstanding employees with five or more years of service. Service milestones are recognized at each five-year increment by presentation of a digital and/or printed certificate with an invitation to select a recognition award via an online catalog.\nTalent\nOur key talent philosophy is to develop talent from within and supplement with external hires. This approach has yielded a deep understanding among our employee base of our business, products and customers, while adding new employees and ideas in support of our continuous improvement mindset. Attracting and retaining the best talent relies on our ability to provide a diverse and inclusive workplace, personal and professional growth opportunities, and a rewarding employee experience. We strive to uphold a culture of shared knowledge, appreciation and success. We believe that our average tenure across the globe reflects our positive workplace culture and the strong engagement of our employees. Our talent acquisition team uses internal and external resources to recruit highly skilled and talented workers, and we encourage employee referrals for open positions.\nTalent development and succession planning for critical roles is a cornerstone of our talent program. Development plans are created and monitored to ensure progress is made along the established timelines. Development plans also intersect with our mission, particularly as we strive to be responsible to our communities.\nOne of our core values—Respect for People—reflects the behavior we strive to include in every aspect of the way we conduct business. Our approach encompasses inclusion awareness and skill-building, intentionality with respect to diversity in our hiring and selection process and performance management and succession planning that recognizes the importance of diversity. We strive to promote inclusion through ongoing “Inclusive Leadership” and unconscious bias training across the Company. We regularly reflect on our progress and explore opportunities to improve our inclusion and diversity programs, including at the executive leadership and Board levels.\nAvailable Information\nOur annual report (Form 10-K), quarterly reports (Form 10-Q) and current reports (Form 8-K) and amendments to those reports filed or furnished with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\") pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are available free of charge at https://investors.nordson.com as soon as reasonably practical after such material is electronically filed with, or furnished to, the SEC.

    "text": "In an enterprise as diverse as ours, a wide range of factors could affect future performance. We discuss in this section some of the risk factors that could materially and adversely affect our business, financial condition, value and results of operations. You should consider these risk factors in connection with evaluating the forward-looking statements contained in this annual report because these factors could cause our actual results and financial condition to differ materially from those projected in forward-looking statements. You should not interpret the disclosure of any risk factor to imply that the risk factor has not already materialized. Additional risks factors may exist that are not presently known by the Company or that are currently deemed immaterial may also be present.\nRisks Related to Economic Conditions\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has negatively disrupted, and may continue to negatively disrupt, our business and results of operations.\nThroughout the COVID-19 pandemic, we have supported, and continue to support, multiple “critical infrastructure” sectors by manufacturing materials and products needed for medical supply chains, packaging, transportation, energy, communications, and other critical infrastructure industries. We have continued to operate during the COVID-19 pandemic in all our production\nNordson Corporation 9\nfacilities, having taken the recommended public health measures to ensure worker and workplace safety. As a result, there have been unfavorable impacts on our manufacturing efficiencies.\nWe continue to actively monitor the evolving circumstances and impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, which has negatively disrupted, and may continue to negatively disrupt, our business and results of operations in the future. For example, in the second quarter of 2022, our revenue growth in Asia-Pacific was negatively impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns in China. COVID-19 lockdown restrictions in China continue to be implemented from time to time. The full extent of the COVID-19 pandemic on our operations and the markets we serve remains highly uncertain and will depend largely on future developments related to the COVID-19 pandemic, including infection rates increasing or returning in various geographic areas, variations of COVID-19, the ultimate duration of the COVID-19 pandemic, actions by government authorities to contain the outbreak or treat its impact, such as reimposing previously lifted measures or putting in place additional restrictions, and the widespread distribution and acceptance of an effective vaccine, among other things. These developments are constantly evolving and cannot be accurately predicted.\nChanges in United States or international economic conditions, including declines in the industries we serve, could adversely affect the profitability of any of our operations.\nIn 2022, approximately 33 percent of our revenue was generated in the United States, while approximately 67 percent was generated outside the United States. The COVID-19 pandemic and related preventative and mitigation measures implemented by governments around the world and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have to date negatively impacted the global economy and created significant volatility and disruption of financial markets.\nA general sustained slowdown in the global economy or in a particular region or industry or an increase in trade tensions with U.S. trading partners could negatively impact our business, financial condition or liquidity. Our largest markets include consumer non-durable, industrial, medical, electronics, consumer durable and automotive. A slowdown in any of these specific end markets could directly affect our revenue stream and profitability.\nA portion of our product sales is attributable to industries and markets, such as the electronics, polymer processing and metal finishing industries, which historically have been cyclical and sensitive to relative changes in supply and demand and general economic conditions. The demand for our products depends, in part, on the general economic conditions of the industries or national economies of our customers. Downward economic cycles in our customers’ industries or countries may reduce sales of some of our products. It is not possible to predict accurately the factors that will affect demand for our products in the future.\nAny significant downturn in the health of the general economy, or any recession, depression or other sustained adverse market event, including inflationary pressures, could have an adverse effect on our revenues and financial performance, resulting in impairment of assets. We cannot predict the strength or duration of any economic slowdown and instability or the timing of any recovery.\nOur results have been and could continue to be impacted by uncertainty in U.S. trade policy, including uncertainty surrounding changes in tariffs, trade agreements or other trade restrictions imposed by the U.S. or other governments.\nOur ability to conduct business can be significantly impacted by changes in tariffs, changes or repeals of trade agreements, including the impact of the “United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement” with Mexico and Canada, which replaced the North American Free Trade Agreement, or the imposition of other trade restrictions or retaliatory actions imposed by various governments. Other effects of these changes, including impacts on the price of raw materials, responsive actions from governments and the opportunity for competitors to establish a presence in markets where we participate, could also have significant impacts on our results. We cannot predict what further action may be taken with respect to tariffs or trade relations between the U.S. and other governments, and any further changes in U.S. or international trade policy could have an adverse impact on our business. Further, the level of impact\nfrom the COVID-19 pandemic and the reactions of governmental authorities and others thereto as well as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine may have significant adverse effects on international trade policy.\nSignificant movements in foreign currency exchange rates or change in monetary policy may harm our financial results.\nWe are exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, particularly with respect to the euro, the yen, the pound sterling and the Chinese yuan. Any significant change in the value of the currencies of the countries in which we do business against the United States dollar could affect our ability to sell products competitively and control our cost structure, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosure About Market Risk.\nA significant portion of our consolidated revenues in 2022 were generated in currencies other than the United States dollar, which is our reporting currency. We recognize foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from our operations in the period incurred. As a result, currency fluctuations between the United States dollar and the currencies in which we do business\nNordson Corporation 10\nhave caused and may continue to cause foreign currency transaction and translation movements, which historically have been material and could continue to be material. We cannot predict the effects of exchange rate fluctuations upon our future operating results because of the number of currencies involved, the variability of currency exposures and the potential volatility of currency exchange rates. We take actions to manage our foreign currency exposure, such as entering into hedging transactions, where applicable, but we cannot assure that our strategies will adequately protect our consolidated operating results from the effects of exchange rate fluctuations. For example, uncertainty surrounding the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the impact of the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, changes in monetary policies and the effects of the departure of the United Kingdom from the European Union (\"Brexit\") have caused increased volatility in global currency exchange rates that have resulted in the strengthening of the United States dollar against the foreign currencies in which we conduct business. Future adverse consequences arising from the COVID-19 pandemic, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, and Brexit may include continued volatility in exchange rates. Any significant fluctuation in exchange rates may be harmful to our financial condition and results of operations. We also face risks arising from the imposition of exchange controls and currency devaluations. Exchange controls may limit our ability to convert foreign currencies into United States dollars or to remit dividends and other payments by our foreign subsidiaries or customers located in or conducting business in a country imposing controls. Currency devaluations diminish the United States dollar value of the currency of the country instituting the devaluation and, if they occur or continue for significant periods, could adversely affect our earnings or cash flow.\nRisks Related to Our Business and Operations\nA disruption in, shortage of, or price increases for, supply of our components and raw materials may adversely impact our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nWhile we manufacture certain parts and components used in our products, we require substantial amounts of raw materials and purchase some parts and components from suppliers. The availability and prices for raw materials, parts and components may be subject to curtailment or change due to, among other things, suppliers' allocation to other purchasers, interruptions in production by suppliers and changes in exchange rates and prevailing price levels, including as a result of inflation. The COVID-19 pandemic and the conflict between Russia and Ukraine have negatively impacted, and may continue to negatively impact, the availability and prices for raw materials, parts, and components. While we generally attempt to pass along higher raw material, part and component costs to our customers in the form of price increases, there historically has been a delay between an increase in our raw material costs and our ability to increase the prices of our products.\nAdditionally, we may not be able to increase the prices of our products due to competitive pricing pressure and other factors.\nShortages in raw materials or our inability to pass along price increases could affect the prices we charge, our operating costs and our competitive position, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nIn addition, our facilities, supply chains, distribution systems and products may be impacted by natural or man-made disruptions, including armed conflict, demand surges, damaging weather or other acts of nature (including weather or other acts of nature caused by climate change), pandemics or other public health crises. A shutdown of, or inability to utilize, one or more of our facilities, our supply chain, or our distribution system could significantly disrupt our operations, delay production and shipments, impact our relationships and reputation with customers, suppliers, employees and others, result in lost or decreased sales, or result in legal exposure and large remediation or other expenses, which could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results of operations and cash flows.\nFailure to retain our existing senior management team or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could hurt our business and inhibit our ability to operate and grow successfully.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has created labor force disruptions impacting factory production and other operations. Our success will continue to depend to a significant extent on the continued service of our executive management team and the ability to recruit, hire and retain other key management personnel, including factory production workers and other staff, to support our growth and operational initiatives and replace those who retire or resign. Failure to retain our leadership team and workforce and to attract and retain other important management and technical personnel could place a constraint on our global growth and operational initiatives, possibly resulting in inefficient and ineffective management and operations, which would likely harm our revenues, operations and product development efforts and eventually result in a decrease in profitability.\nThe Company may be subject to risks relating to organizational changes.\nWe regularly execute organizational changes such as acquisitions, divestitures and realignments to support our growth and cost management strategies. We also engage in initiatives aimed to increase productivity, efficiencies and cash flow and to reduce costs. The Company commits significant resources to identify, develop and retain key employees to ensure uninterrupted leadership and direction. If we are unable to successfully manage these and other organizational changes, the ability to complete such activities and realize anticipated synergies or cost savings as well as our results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected. We cannot offer assurances that any of these initiatives will be beneficial to the extent\nNordson Corporation 11\nanticipated, or that the estimated efficiency improvements, incremental cost savings or cash flow improvements will be realized as anticipated or at all.\nPolitical conditions in and between the United States and foreign countries in which we operate could adversely affect us.\nWe conduct our manufacturing, sales and distribution operations on a worldwide basis and are subject to risks associated with doing business both within and outside the United States. We expect that international operations and United States export sales will continue to be important to our business for the foreseeable future. Both sales from international operations and export sales are subject to varying degrees of risks inherent in doing business outside the United States. Such risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n•\nrisks of political or economic instability;\n•\nunanticipated or unfavorable circumstances arising from host country laws or regulations;\n•\nthreats of war, terrorism or governmental instability, including the conflict between Russia and Ukraine;\n•\nchanges in tax rates, adoption of new tax laws or other additional tax policies, and other proposals to reform United States and foreign tax laws that impact how United States multinational corporations are taxed on foreign earnings;\n•\nrestrictions on the transfer of funds into or out of a country;\n•\npotential negative consequences from changes to taxation policies;\n•\nthe disruption of operations from labor and political disturbances;\n•\nthe imposition of tariffs, import or export licensing requirements and other potential changes in trade policies and relations arising from policy initiatives implemented by the U.S. presidential administration;\n•\nexchange controls or other trade restrictions including transfer pricing restrictions when products produced in one country are sold to an affiliated entity in another country; and\n•\ngovernment responses to the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAny of these events could reduce the demand for our products, limit the prices at which we can sell our products, interrupt our supply chain, or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating performance.\nOur international operations also depend upon favorable trade relations between the U.S. and those foreign countries in which our customers, subcontractors and materials suppliers have operations. A protectionist trade environment in either the U.S. or those foreign countries in which we do business, such as a change in the current tariff structures, export compliance or other trade policies, may materially and adversely affect our ability to sell our products in foreign markets. The current U.S. presidential administration has criticized existing trade agreements, and while it remains unclear what actions the current or future administration may take with respect to existing and proposed trade agreements, or restrictions on trade generally, more stringent export and import controls may be ultimately imposed in the future.\nIncreased information technology threats and more sophisticated and targeted cybercrime could pose a risk to our systems, networks, products, solutions and services.\nWe have experienced and expect to continue to experience cyber-attacks to our systems and networks. To date, we have not experienced any material breaches or material losses related to cyber-attacks. To conduct our business, we rely extensively on information technology systems, networks and services, some of which are managed, hosted and provided by third-party service providers. Increased global information technology security threats, more sophisticated and targeted computer crime and cyberterrorism pose a risk to the security of our systems and networks and those of our third-party service providers and the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data. Depending on their nature and scope, such threats could potentially lead to the compromising of confidential information, including but not limited to confidential information relating to customer or employee data, improper use of our systems and networks, manipulation and destruction of data, defective products, production downtimes and operational disruptions, which in turn could adversely affect our reputation, competitiveness and results of operations. A cyber-attack or other disruption may also result in financial loss, including potential fines for failure to safeguard data or losses in connection with any litigation that may result from a cyber-attack. Our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all the costs arising from such events.\nWe have taken steps and incurred costs to further strengthen the security of our computer systems and continue to assess, maintain and enhance the ongoing effectiveness of our information security systems. While we attempt to mitigate these risks by employing a number of measures, including employee training, comprehensive monitoring of our networks and systems, and maintenance of backup and protective systems, our systems, networks, products, solutions and services remain potentially vulnerable to advanced persistent threats. The techniques used by criminals to obtain unauthorized access to sensitive data\nNordson Corporation 12\nchange frequently and often are not recognizable until launched against a target. Accordingly, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or implement adequate preventative measures. It is therefore possible that in the future we may suffer a criminal attack, unauthorized parties may gain access to personal information in our possession and we may not be able to identify any such incident in a timely manner.\nThe interpretation and application of data protection laws, including federal, state and international laws, relating to the collection, use, retention, disclosure, security and transfer of personally identifiable data in the U.S., Europe and elsewhere (including but not limited to the European Union’s GDPR, the Brazilian General Data Protection Law and the CCPA), are uncertain and evolving. It is possible that these laws may be interpreted and applied in a manner that is inconsistent with our data practices. In addition, as a result of existing or new data protection requirements, we incur and expect to continue to incur significant ongoing operating costs as part of our significant efforts to protect and safeguard our sensitive data and personal information. These efforts also may divert management and employee attention from other business and growth initiatives. A breach in information privacy could result in legal or reputational risks and could have a negative impact on our revenues and results of operations.\nIf our intellectual property protection is inadequate, others may be able to use our technologies and tradenames and thereby reduce our ability to compete, which could have a material adverse effect on us, our financial condition and results of operations.\nWe regard much of the technology underlying our products and the trademarks under which we market our products as proprietary. The steps we take to protect our proprietary technology may be inadequate to prevent misappropriation of our technology, or third parties may independently develop similar technology. We rely on a combination of patents, trademark, copyright and trade secret laws, employee and third-party non-disclosure agreements and other contracts to establish and protect our technology and other intellectual property rights. The agreements may be breached or terminated, and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach, and existing trade secrets, patent and copyright law afford us limited protection. Policing unauthorized use of our intellectual property is difficult. A third party could copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology without authorization. Litigation may be necessary for us to defend against claims of infringement or to protect our intellectual property rights and could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our efforts. Further, we might not prevail in such litigation, which could harm our business.\nOur products could infringe on the intellectual property of others, which may cause us to engage in costly litigation and, if we are not successful, could cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products.\nThird parties may assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us based on their patents or other intellectual property claims, and we may have to pay substantial damages, possibly including treble damages, if it is ultimately determined our products infringe. We may have to obtain a license to sell our products if it is determined that our products infringe upon another party’s intellectual property. We might be prohibited from selling our products before we obtain a license, which, if available at all, may require us to pay substantial royalties. Even if infringement claims against us are without merit, defending these types of lawsuits takes significant time, may be expensive and may divert management attention from other business concerns.\nRisks Related to the Execution of Our Strategy\nWe continually assess the strategic fit of our existing businesses and may divest or otherwise dispose of businesses that are deemed not to fit with our strategic plan or are not achieving the desired return on investment, and we cannot be certain that our business, operating results and financial condition will not be materially and adversely affected.\nA successful divestiture depends on various factors, including reaching an agreement with potential buyers on terms we deem attractive, as well as our ability to effectively transfer liabilities, contracts, facilities, and employees to any purchaser, identify and separate the intellectual property to be divested from the intellectual property that we wish to retain, reduce fixed costs previously associated with the divested assets or business, and collect the proceeds from any divestitures. These efforts require varying levels of management resources, which may divert our attention from other business operations. If we do not realize the expected benefits of any divestiture transaction, our consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows could be negatively impacted. In addition, divestitures of businesses involve a number of risks, including significant costs and expenses, the loss of customer relationships and a decrease in revenues and earnings associated with the divested business. Furthermore, divestitures potentially involve significant post-closing separation activities, which could involve the expenditure of material financial resources and significant employee resources. Any divestiture may result in a dilutive impact to our future earnings if we are unable to offset the dilutive impact from the loss of revenue associated with the divestiture, as well as significant write-offs, including those related to goodwill and other intangible assets, which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition.\nNordson Corporation 13\nIf we fail to develop new products or enhance existing products, or our customers do not accept the new or enhanced products we develop, our revenue and profitability could be adversely impacted.\nInnovation is critical to our success. We believe that we must continue to enhance our existing products and to develop and manufacture new products with improved capabilities in order to continue to be a leading provider of precision technology solutions. We also believe that we must continue to make improvements in our productivity in order to maintain our competitive position. Difficulties or delays in research, development or production of new or enhanced products or failure to gain market acceptance of new or enhanced products and technologies may reduce future sales and adversely affect our competitive position. We continue to invest in the development and marketing of new or enhanced products. There can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to make such investments, that we will be able to make the technological advances necessary to maintain competitive advantages or that we can recover major research and development expenses. If we fail to make innovations, launch products with quality problems or the market does not accept our new products, our financial condition, results of operations, cash flows and liquidity could be adversely affected. In addition, as new or enhanced products are introduced, we must successfully manage the transition from older products to minimize disruption in customers’ ordering patterns, avoid excessive levels of older product inventories and ensure that we can deliver sufficient supplies of new products to meet customers’ demands.\nOur growth strategy includes acquisitions, and we may not be able to execute on our acquisition strategy or integrate acquisitions successfully.\nOur recent historical growth has depended, and our future growth is likely to continue to depend, in part on our acquisition strategy and the successful integration of acquired businesses into our existing operations. For example, in November 2022, we completed our acquisition of CyberOptics. We intend to continue to seek additional acquisition opportunities both to expand into new markets and to enhance our position in existing markets throughout the world. We cannot assure we will be able to successfully identify suitable acquisition opportunities, prevail against competing potential acquirers, negotiate appropriate acquisition terms, obtain financing that may be needed to consummate such acquisitions, complete proposed acquisitions, successfully integrate acquired businesses into our existing operations or expand into new markets. In addition, we cannot assure that any acquisition, including the recent acquisition of CyberOptics, once successfully integrated, will perform as planned, be accretive to earnings, or prove to be beneficial to our operations and cash flow.\nThe success of our acquisition strategy is subject to other risks and uncertainties, including:\n•\nour ability to realize operating efficiencies, synergies or other benefits expected from an acquisition, and possible delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products;\n•\ndiversion of management’s time and attention from other business concerns;\n•\ndifficulties in retaining key employees, customers or suppliers of the acquired business;\n•\ndifficulties in maintaining uniform standards, controls, procedures and policies throughout acquired companies;\n•\nadverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers or customers;\n•\nthe risks associated with the assumption of product liabilities or contingent or undisclosed liabilities of acquisition targets; and\n•\nthe ability to generate future cash flows or the availability of financing.\nIn addition, an acquisition could adversely impact our operating performance as a result of the incurrence of acquisition-related debt, pre-acquisition potential tax liabilities, acquisition expenses, the amortization of acquisition-acquired assets, or possible future impairments of goodwill or intangible assets associated with the acquisition.\nWe may also face liability with respect to acquired businesses for violations of environmental laws occurring prior to the date of our acquisition, and some or all of these liabilities may not be covered by environmental insurance secured to mitigate the risk or by indemnification from the sellers from which we acquired these businesses. We could also incur significant costs, including, but not limited to, remediation costs, natural resources damages, civil or criminal fines and sanctions and third-party claims, as a result of past or future violations of, or liabilities, associated with environmental laws.\nAny impairment in the value of our intangible assets, including goodwill, would negatively affect our operating results and total capitalization.\nOur total assets reflect substantial intangible assets, primarily goodwill. The goodwill results from our acquisitions and represents the excess of cost over the fair value of the identifiable net assets we acquired. We assess at least annually whether there has been any impairment in the value of our intangible assets. If future operating performance at one or more of our business units were to fall significantly below current levels, if competing or alternative technologies emerge, if market conditions for acquired businesses decline, if significant and prolonged negative industry or economic trends exist, if our stock\nNordson Corporation 14\nprice and market capitalization declines, or if future cash flow estimates decline, we could incur, under current applicable accounting rules, a non-cash charge to operating earnings for goodwill impairment. Any determination requiring the write-off of a significant portion of unamortized intangible assets would negatively affect our results of operations and equity book value, the effect of which could be material.\nRisks Related to Legal, Compliance and Regulatory Matters\nChanges in United States and international tax laws may have a material adverse effect on our business, financial condition and results of operations.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. Changes in applicable domestic or foreign tax laws and regulations, or their interpretation and application, including the possibility of retroactive effect, could affect our business, financial condition and profitability by increasing our tax liabilities. Our future results of operations could be adversely affected by changes in our effective tax rate as a result of a change in the mix of earnings in jurisdictions with differing statutory tax rates, changes in our overall profitability, changes in tax legislation and rates, changes in generally accepted accounting principles and changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities. The U.S. federal government may adopt changes to international trade agreements, tariffs, taxes and other government rules and regulations. While we cannot predict what changes will actually occur with respect to any of these items, such changes could affect our business and results of operations.\nWe may be exposed to liabilities under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA), which could have a material adverse effect on our business.\nWe are subject to compliance with various laws and regulations, including the FCPA, UK Bribery Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery and anti-corruption laws, which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from engaging in bribery or making other improper payments to private or public parties for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business or gaining an unfair business advantage. The FCPA also requires proper record keeping and characterization of such payments in our reports filed with the SEC. Our employees are trained and required to comply with these laws, and we are committed to legal compliance and corporate ethics. Violations of these laws could result in severe criminal or civil sanctions and financial penalties and other consequences that may have a material adverse effect on our business, reputation, financial condition or results of operations.\nThe level of returns on pension plan assets, changes in the actuarial assumptions used and management of pension liabilities could adversely affect us.\nOur operating results may be positively or negatively impacted by the amount of expense we record for our defined benefit pension plans. U.S. GAAP requires that we calculate pension expense using actuarial valuations, which are dependent upon our various assumptions including estimates of expected long-term rate of return on plan assets, discount rates for future payment obligations, and the expected rate of increase in future compensation levels. Our pension expense and funding requirements may also be affected by our actual return on plan assets and by legislation and other government regulatory actions. Changes in assumptions, laws or regulations and how the Company manages pension liabilities could lead to variability in financial results and could have a material adverse impact on liquidity.\nOur global operations are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulatory requirements, and compliance with evolving environmental regulatory requirements could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nWe are subject to increasingly complex environmental regulations affecting international manufacturers, including those related to air and water emissions, waste management and climate change. Some environmental laws impose strict, retroactive and joint and several liability for the remediation of the release of hazardous substances, even for conduct that was lawful at the time it occurred, or for the conduct of or conditions caused by prior operators, predecessors or third parties. Failure to comply with environmental laws could expose us to penalties or clean-up costs, civil or criminal liability and sanctions on certain of our activities, as well as damage to property or natural resources. These liabilities, sanctions, damages and remediation efforts related to any non-compliance with such laws and regulations could negatively impact our ability to conduct our operations and our financial condition and results of operations. In addition, there can be no assurances that we will not be adversely affected by costs, liabilities or claims with respect to existing or subsequently acquired operations or under present laws and regulations or those that may be adopted or imposed in the future.\nChanges in environmental laws or regulations could result in higher expenses and payments, and uncertainty relating to environmental laws or regulations may also affect how we conduct our operations and structure our investments and could limit our ability to enforce our rights. Changes in environmental and climate change laws or regulations, including laws relating to greenhouse gas emissions, could subject us to additional costs and restrictions, including increased energy and raw material\nNordson Corporation 15\ncosts. If environmental laws or regulations are either changed or adopted and impose significant operational restrictions and compliance requirements upon us or our products, they could negatively impact our business, capital expenditures, results of operations, financial condition and competitive position.\nIt is our policy to apply strict standards for environmental protection to all of our operations within and outside of the United States, even when we are not subject to local government regulations. We may incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, liabilities resulting from third-party property damage or personal injury claims, or our products could be prohibited from entering certain jurisdictions, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws, if our products become non-compliant with environmental laws or if we were to undertake environmental protection actions voluntarily.\nExpectations relating to environmental, social and governance considerations expose us to potential liabilities, increased costs, reputational harm and other adverse effects on our business.\nMany governments, regulators, investors, employees, customers and other stakeholders are increasingly focused on environmental, social and governance considerations relating to businesses, including climate change and greenhouse gas emissions, human capital and diversity, equity and inclusion. We make statements about our environmental, social and governance goals and initiatives through information provided on our website, press statements and other communications, including through our ESG Report. Responding to these environmental, social and governance considerations and implementation of these goals and initiatives involves risks and uncertainties, requires investments and are impacted by factors that may be outside our control.\nIn addition, some stakeholders may disagree with our goals and initiatives and the focus of stakeholders may change and evolve over time. Stakeholders also may have very different views on where environmental, social and governance focus should be placed, including differing views of regulators in various jurisdictions in which we operate. Any failure, or perceived failure, by us to achieve our goals, further our initiatives, adhere to our public statements, comply with federal, state or international environmental, social and governance laws and regulations, or meet evolving and varied stakeholder expectations and standards could result in legal and regulatory proceedings against us and materially adversely affect our business, reputation, results of operations, financial condition and stock price.\nRisks Related to Our Capital Structure\nOur inability to comply with our existing credit facilities’ restrictive covenants or to access additional sources of capital could impede our growth or the repayment or refinancing of existing indebtedness.\nThe limits imposed on us by the restrictive covenants contained in our credit facilities could prevent us from making acquisitions or cause us to lose access to these facilities.\nOur existing credit facilities contain restrictive covenants that limit our ability to, among other things:\n•\nborrow money or guarantee the debts of others;\n•\nuse assets as security in other transactions;\n•\nmake restricted payments or distributions; and\n•\nsell or acquire assets or merge with or into other companies.\nIn addition, our credit facilities require us to meet financial ratios, including a “Leverage Ratio” and an “Interest Coverage Ratio,” both as defined in the credit facilities.\nThese restrictions could limit our ability to plan for or react to market conditions or meet extraordinary capital needs and could otherwise restrict our financing activities.\nOur ability to comply with the covenants and other terms of our credit facilities will depend on our future operating performance. If we fail to comply with such covenants and terms, we may be in default and the maturity of the related debt could be accelerated and become immediately due and payable. We may be required to obtain waivers from our lenders in order to maintain compliance under our credit facilities, including waivers with respect to our compliance with certain financial covenants. If we are unable to obtain necessary waivers and the debt under our credit facilities is accelerated, we would be required to obtain replacement financing at prevailing market rates.\nWe may need new or additional financing in the future to expand our business or refinance existing indebtedness. If we are unable to access capital on satisfactory terms and conditions, we may not be able to expand our business or meet our payment requirements under our existing credit facilities. Our ability to obtain new or additional financing will depend on a variety of factors, many of which are beyond our control. We may not be able to obtain new or additional financing because we have substantial debt or because we may not have sufficient cash flow to service or repay our existing or future debt. In addition, depending on market conditions and our financial performance, neither debt nor equity financing may be available on\nNordson Corporation 16\nsatisfactory terms or at all. Finally, as a consequence of worsening financial market conditions, our credit facility providers may not provide the agreed credit if they become undercapitalized.\nChanges in interest rates could adversely affect us.\nAny period of interest rate increases may adversely affect our profitability. As of October 31, 2022, we had $\n738,822\nof total debt outstanding, of which 35 percent was priced at interest rates that float with the market. A one percentage point increase in the interest rate on the floating rate debt in 2022 would have resulted in approximately $2,841 of additional interest expense. A higher level of floating rate debt would increase the exposure to changes in interest rates. For additional detail related to this risk, see Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk.\nGeneral Risk Factors\nThe insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures.\nWe maintain property, business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations, including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered. We are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fail or deny our claims. Additionally, severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers. In the future, we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels, and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain.\nOur business and operating results may be adversely affected by natural disasters or other catastrophic events beyond our control.\nWhile we have taken precautions to prevent production and service interruptions at our global facilities, severe weather conditions, including any that may be caused by global climate change, such as hurricanes or tornadoes, as well as major earthquakes, wildfires and other natural disasters in areas in which we have manufacturing facilities or from which we obtain products may cause physical damage to our properties, closure of one or more of our manufacturing or distribution facilities, lack of an adequate work force in a market, temporary disruption in the supply of inventory, disruption in the transport of products and utilities, and delays in the delivery of products to our customers. Any of these factors may disrupt our operations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations."

    "text": "NOTE REGARDING AMOUNTS AND FISCAL YEAR REFERENCES\nIn this annual report, all amounts related to United States dollars and foreign currency and to the number of Nordson Corporation’s common shares, except for per share earnings and dividend amounts, are expressed in thousands. Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to “we,” “us,” “our,” or the “Company” mean Nordson Corporation.\nUnless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year ending October 31.\nCritical Accounting Policies and Estimates\nOur Consolidated Financial Statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States. The preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates, judgments and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses. On an ongoing basis, we evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that are used to prepare financial statements. We base our estimates on historical experience and assumptions believed to be reasonable under current facts and circumstances. Actual amounts and results could differ from these estimates used by management.\nCertain accounting policies that require significant management estimates and are deemed critical to our results of operations or financial position are discussed below. On a regular basis, critical accounting policies are reviewed with the Audit Committee of the board of directors.\nRevenue recognition -\nA contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Refer to Note 1 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion regarding the Company's revenue recognition policy.\nBusiness combinations -\nThe acquisitions of our businesses are accounted for under the acquisition method of accounting. The amounts assigned to the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in connection with acquisitions are based on estimated fair values as of the date of the acquisition, with the remainder, if any, recorded as goodwill. The fair values are determined by management, taking into consideration information supplied by the management of the acquired entities, and other relevant information. Such information typically includes valuations obtained from independent appraisal experts, which management reviews and considers in its estimates of fair values. The valuations are generally based upon future cash flow projections for the acquired assets, discounted to present value. The determination of fair values requires significant judgment by management, particularly with respect to the value of identifiable intangible assets. This judgment could result in either a higher or lower value assigned to amortizable or depreciable assets. The impact could result in either higher or lower amortization and/or depreciation expense.\nGoodwill -\nGoodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested for impairment annually at the reporting unit level, or more often if indications of impairment exist.\nWe test goodwill in accordance with Accounting Standards Codification (\"ASC\") 350. We did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2022. We use an independent valuation specialist to assist with refining our assumptions and methods used to determine fair values. To test for goodwill impairment, we estimate the fair value of each of our reporting units using a combination of the Income Approach and the Market Approach. Effective in the fourth quarter of 2022, we realigned our former two operating segments into three: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. Previously, Advanced Technology Solutions was comprised of Medical and Fluid Solutions and the former Advanced Technology Solutions.  Our segment change did not have any impact on our reporting units.\nThe discounted cash flow method (Income Approach) uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. Terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the Gordon Growth Model Method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant Weighted Average Cost of Capital (\"WACC\") methodology and growth rate. For each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. Discount rates are developed using a WACC methodology.\nNordson Corporation 23\nThe WACC represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors. For 2022, the WACC rates used ranged from 8.3 percent to 11.0 percent depending upon the reporting unit's size, end market volatility and projection risk. See Note 6 - Goodwill and intangible assets for further details regarding the valuation methodologies used.\nIn 2022, 2021 and 2020, the results of our annual impairment tests indicated no impairment.\nThe fair value (\"FV\") was compared to the carrying value (\"CV\") for each reporting unit. Based on the results shown in the table below and based on our measurement date of August 1, 2022, our conclusion is that no goodwill was impaired in 2022. Potential events or circumstances, such as a sustained downturn in global economies, could have a negative effect on estimated fair values.\nPension plan in the United States\n- The measurement of the liabilities related to our domestic pension plan is based on management’s assumptions related to future factors, including interest rates, return on pension plan assets, compensation increases, mortality and turnover assumptions, and health care cost trend rates. The liabilities associated with the Company's international pension plans and OPEB are not as materially sensitive to changes in assumptions as the pension plan in the United States.\nThe weighted-average discount rate used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 5.70 percent at October 31, 2022 and 3.02 percent at October 31, 2021. The discount rate used was determined by using quality fixed income investments with a duration period approximately equal to the period over which pension obligations are expected to be settled.\nIn determining the expected return on plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and actuarial experts in developing appropriate return assumptions. The expected rate of return (long-term investment rate) on domestic pension assets used to determine net benefit costs was 5.75 percent in both 2022 and 2021.\nThe assumed rate of compensation increases used to determine the present value of our domestic pension plan obligations was 4.30 percent and 4.00 percent at  October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively.\nAnnual expense amounts are determined based on the discount rate used at the end of the prior year. Differences between actual and assumed investment returns on pension plan assets result in actuarial gains or losses that are amortized into expense over a period of years.\nEconomic assumptions have a significant effect on the amounts reported. The effect of a one percent change in the discount rate, expected return on assets and compensation increase is shown in the table below. Bracketed numbers represent decreases in expense and obligation amounts.\nNordson Corporation 24\nIncome taxes\n– Income taxes are estimated based on income for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and certain changes in valuation allowances. We provide valuation allowances against deferred tax assets if, based on available evidence, it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized.\nManagement believes the valuation allowances are adequate after considering future taxable income, allowable carryforward periods and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. In the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize the deferred tax assets in the future in excess of the net recorded amount (including the valuation allowance), an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made. Conversely, should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax asset in the future, an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be expensed in the period such determination was made.\nFurther, at each interim reporting period, we estimate an effective income tax rate that is expected to be applicable for the full year. Significant judgment is involved regarding the application of global income tax laws and regulations and when projecting the jurisdictional mix of income. Additionally, interpretation of tax laws, court decisions or other guidance provided by taxing authorities influences our estimate of the effective income tax rates. As a result, our actual effective income tax rates and related income tax liabilities may differ materially from our estimated effective tax rates and related income tax liabilities. Any resulting differences are recorded in the period they become known.\nCyberOptics Acquisition\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of CyberOptics Corporation (“CyberOptics”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2022, by and among the Company, Meta Merger Company and CyberOptics. CyberOptics is\na leading global developer and manufacturer of high-precision 3D optical sensing technology solutions. The CyberOptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform, providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and will be reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment. The all-cash transaction of approximately $380,000, net of cash acquired, was funded using our revolving credit facility and is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements\nResults of Operations\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2022, we realigned and separated our\ntwo\nformer operating segments into the following\nthree\noperating segments: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. Previously, Advanced Technology Solutions was comprised of Medical and Fluid Solutions and the former Advanced Technology Solutions. Existing product lines were unchanged as part of this new structure. We made these changes to realign our management team and our operating segments. We believe this realignment gives us better visibility into our medical and electronics platforms, which have grown significantly through both organic and acquisitive opportunities, including through the recent acquisition of CyberOptics. We also believe that the three revised operating segments better reflect how we now manage the Company, allocate resources and assess performance of the businesses. We also revised our geographic regions, such that the United States and Japan are now included in the Americas and Asia Pacific regions, respectively. As such, our geographical regions as used throughout this annual report include the Americas (United States, Canada, Mexico and Central and South America), Asia Pacific (including Japan) and Europe.\nBelow is a detailed discussion comparison of our results of operations for the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021 as well as a comparison of sales and segment results for fiscal years October 31, 2021 and October 31, 2020 due to our change in operating segments and geographic regions. For a discussion of other changes from the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021 to the fiscal year ended October 31, 2020, refer to Part II, Item 7, Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations, of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 31, 2021.\n2022 compared to 2021\nWorldwide sales for 2022 were $2,590,278, an increase of 9.7 percent from 2021 sales of $2,362,209. The increase consisted of a 10.8 percent improvement in organic sales, inclusive of pricing to offset inflation, and a net 3.3 percent increase from acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by unfavorable currency translation effects that decreased sales by 4.4 percent.\nSales outside the United States accounted for 66.8 percent of total sales in 2022, as compared to 66.6 percent in 2021. On a geographic basis, sales in the Americas region were $1,096,596, an increase of 13.2 percent from 2021, with sales volume increasing 10.9 percent and a net 2.8 percent increase from acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by unfavorable currency effect of 0.5 percent. Sales in the Asia Pacific region were $848,079, an increase of 9.3 percent from 2021, with sales volume increasing 11.0 percent and a net 3.2 percent increase from acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 4.9 percent. Sales in Europe were $645,603, an increase of 4.6 percent from 2021. The increase in sales\nNordson Corporation 25\nconsisted of a 10.7 percent organic sales volume increase and a net 3.9 percent increase from acquisitions and divestitures, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 10.0 percent.\nCost of sales were $1,163,742 in 2022, up\n12.1 percent from $1,038,129 in 2021. Gross profit, expressed as a percentage of sales, decreased to 55.1 percent in 2022 from 56.1 percent in 2021. The 1.0 percentage point decrease in gross margin was driven by the impact of passing through inflationary cost increases, partially offset by a favorable divestiture impact.\nSelling and administrative expenses were $724,176 in 2022, up from $708,953 in 2021. The 2.1 percent increase was driven by a 5.3 percent first-year effect of an acquisition impact and base business growth of 0.3 percentage points, partially offset by favorable currency translation effects which decreased costs 3.5 percentage points. Selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales decreased to 28.0 percent in 2022 from 30.0 percent in 2021. The 2.0 percentage point decrease was due primarily to sales growth leverage.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 27.1 percent in 2022 compared to 26.0 percent in 2021. The 1.1 percent increase in operating margin was primarily driven by\nselling and administrative expense leverage due to the 10.8 percent increase in organic sales, partially offset by the impact of passing through inflationary cost increases.\nOperating capacity for each of our segments can support fluctuations in order activity without significant changes in operating costs. Operating margins for each segment were unfavorably impacted by a stronger dollar primarily against all major currencies during 2022 as compared to 2021.\nInterest expense in 2022 was $22,413, a decrease of $3,078, or 12.1 percent, from\n2021\n. The decrease was due to lower average debt levels compared to the prior year. During 2022, the Company recognized non-cash pension settlement charges of $41,221 related to the purchase of an annuity contract to relieve the Company of certain U.S. pension benefit obligations. Other income in 2022 was $8,527 compared to other expense of $17,610 in\n2021\n. Included in other income in 2022 w\nere $6,270 in net foreign currency gains. Included in the prior year’s other expense were pension costs of 9,484 and $5,926 in foreign currency losses. The decrease in pension cost was principally attributable to decreased amortization of net actuarial losses.\nIncome tax expense in 2022 was $136,176, or 21.0 percent of pre-tax income, as compared to $119,808, or 20.9 percent of pre-tax income in\n2021\n. The income tax provision for 2022 included a tax benefit of $3,273 due to our share-based payment transactions. Our income tax provision for 2021 included a tax benefit of $5,982 due to our share-based payment transactions.\nNet income was $513,103, or $8.81 per diluted share, in 2022, compared to net income of $454,368, or $7.74 per diluted share, in 2021. This represented a 12.9 percent increase in net income and a 13.8 percent increase in diluted earnings per share. The increase of $1.07 per diluted share was primarily driven by sales growth, strong gross margins and selling and administrative expense leverage.\nIndustrial Precision Solutions\nSales of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment were $1,337,242 in 2022, an increase of 7.2 percent, from 2021 sales of $1,246,947. The increase was the result of an organic sales increase of 7.0 percent and a net acquisition / divestiture impact of 6.1 percent, partially offset by unfavorable currency effects of 5.9 percent. Organic sales growth occurred in all product lines, except nonwovens. Sales growth was generally strong across all product lines and in all regions, except for nonwovens which had sales declines in all regions.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to 32.5 percent in 2022 compared to 33.2 percent in 2021. The\n0.7 percentage point decline\nin operating margin was the result of\nthe impact of passing through inflationary cost increases\n, partially offset by\nselling and administrative expense leverage due to the increase in sales\n.\nMedical and Fluid Solutions\nSales of the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment were $690,177 in 2022, an increase of 7.6 percent from 2021 sales of $641,654. The increase was the result of an organic sales increase of 9.7 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 2.1 percent. Sales growth was generally strong across all product lines and in all regions.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 31.5 percent in 2022 compared to 30.9 percent in 2021. The 0.6 percent percentage point improvement in operating margin was principally driven by greater selling and administrative expense leverage which contributed 1.6 percentage points, principally associated with the sales volume growth, partially offset by\nthe impact of passing through inflationary cost increases\n.\nAdvanced Technology Solutions\nSales of the Advanced Technology Solutions segment were $562,859 in 2022, an increase of 18.8 percent from 2021 sales of $473,608. The increase was the result of an organic sales increase of 22.4 percent partially offset by unfavorable currency effects that decreased sales by 3.6 percent. Sales growth was strong across all product lines and in all regions.\nNordson Corporation 26\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 23.7 percent in 2022 compared to 15.5 percent in 2021. The 8.2 percentage point improvement in operating margin was driven by greater selling and administrative expense leverage associated with the sales volume growth.\n2021 compared to 2020\nDue to the change in our operating segments and geographical regions, the following comparison of our sales and segment results are being provided.\nWorldwide sales for 2021 were $2,362,209, an increase of 11.4 percent from 2020 sales of $2,121,100. The increase consisted of a 11.3 percent improvement in organic sales volume and favorable currency translation effects, which increased sales by 2.7 percent, partially offset by a net 2.6 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures.\nOn a geographic basis, sales in the Americas region were $969,110, an increase of 8.0 percent from 2020, with organic sales volume increasing 10.7 percent and a favorable currency effect of 0.4 percent, partially offset by a net 3.0 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. Sales in the Asia Pacific region were $775,607, an increase of 12.8 percent from 2020, with organic sales volume increasing 11.8 percent and favorable currency effects of 3.3 percent, partially offset by a net 2.3 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures. Sales in Europe were $617,492, an increase of 15.1 percent from 2020. The increase in sales consisted of a 11.4 percent organic sales volume increase and favorable currency effects of 5.7 percent, partially offset by a 2.0 percent decrease from acquisitions and divestitures.\nIndustrial Precision Solutions\nSales of the Industrial Precision Solutions segment were $\n1,246,947\nin 2021, an increase of 9.1 percent, from 2020 sales of $\n1,143,423\n. The increase was the result of an organic sales volume increase of 11.7 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 3.4 percent, partially offset by a divestiture impact of 6.0 percent. Growth occurred in all product lines, except nonwovens, and in all regions except for Japan.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 33.2 percent in\n2021\ncompared to 18.2 percent in\n2020\n. The\n15.0 percentage point improvement\nin operating margin was the result of improved operating results, specifically favorable absorption from higher sales volume and favorable product mix driven by a divestiture, and 2020 operating profit negatively impacted by an assets held for sale impairment charge related to a divestiture.\nMedical and Fluid Solutions\nSales of the Medical and Fluid Solutions segment were $\n641,654\nin 2021, an increase of 13.6 percent from 2020 sales of $\n564,899\n. The increase was the result of an organic sales volume increase of 9.8 percent, a positive acquisition impact of 2.3 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 1.5 percent. Sales growth was generally strong across all product lines and in all regions.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 30.9 percent in\n2021\ncompared to 26.6 percent in\n2020\n. The 4.3 percentage point improvement in operating margin was principally driven by greater selling and administrative expense leverage associated with the sales volume growth.\nAdvanced Technology Solutions\nSales of the Advanced Technology Solutions segment were $473,608 in 2021, an increase of 14.7 percent from 2020 sales of $\n412,778\n. The increase was the result of an organic sales volume increase of 12.4 percent and favorable currency effects that increased sales by 2.3 percent. Sales growth was generally strong across all product lines and in all regions.\nOperating profit as a percentage of sales increased to 15.5 percent in\n2021\ncompared to 10.0 percent in\n2020\n. The 5.5 percentage point improvement in operating margin was principally driven by greater selling and administrative expense leverage associated with the sales volume growth and cost simplification actions taken in 2020.\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nCash and cash equivalents decreased $136,515 in 2022 to $163,457 as of October 31, 2022 compared to $299,972 as of October 31, 2021. Approximately 53 percent of our consolidated cash and cash equivalents were held at various foreign subsidiaries as of October 31, 2022. On November 3, 2022, net cash of $380,000 was used to fund the acquisition of\nCyberOptics as disclosed in Note 19\nto these Consolidated Financial Statements.\nCash provided by operating activities was $513,131 in 2022, compared to $545,927 in 2021. The primary sources were net income adjusted for non-cash income and expenses (consisting of depreciation and amortization, non-cash stock compensation, provision for losses on receivables, deferred income taxes, other non-cash expense, gain/loss on sale of property, plant and equipment, and non-cash pension settlement charges), which were $676,200 in 2022, compared to $590,607 in 2021. Changes in working capital items used cash of $107,314 compared to $29,011 provided in 2021 as increases in receivables and inventory\nNordson Corporation 27\nbased on sales growth were partially offset by increases in other liabilities. In addition, cash used for other operating items decreased by $17,936 in 2022 compared to 2021.\nCash used in investing activities was $222,761 in 2022, compared to $33,169 in 2021. In 2022, $171,613 in cash was used, utilizing cash from operations, for acquisitions compared to $0 used in 2021. Capital expenditures were $51,428 in 2022 compared to $38,303 in 2021.\nCash used in financing activities was $416,006 in 2022, compared to $422,913 cash used in 2021. Net repayment of long-term debt and long-term borrowings used $33,908 of cash in 2022, compared to $289,416 used in 2021. In 2022, cash of $262,869 was used for the purchase of treasury shares, up from $60,970 used in 2021. Dividend payments were $125,914 in 2022, up from $97,683 in 2021 due to an increase in dividend on our common shares, on an annual basis, to $2.18 per share from $1.69 per share. Issuance of common shares related to employee benefit plans generated $12,124 of cash in 2022, down from $31,780 in 2021.\nThe following is a summary of significant changes by balance sheet caption from October 31, 2021 to October 31, 2022. Receivables-net and inventories-net combined increased $104,127 due to increased business activity during the year. Goodwill increased\n$131,129 due to the acquisition of NDC Technologies.\nIntangible assets-net decreased $27,965 primarily due to amortization expense. Pension obligations decreased $40,033 primarily due to a decrease in discount rates.\nWe have a $850,000 unsecured multi-currency revolving credit facility with a group of banks that expires in April 2024. At October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, we had no balances outstanding under the revolving credit facility. In connection with the CyberOptics acquisition, we borrowed under the revolving credit facility.\nOur operating performance, balance sheet position and financial ratios for 2022 remained strong. Total debt decreased $78,040 during 2022. The Company is well-positioned to manage liquidity needs that arise from working capital requirements, capital expenditures, and contributions related to pension and postretirement obligations as well as principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt. Primary sources of capital to meet these needs, as well as other opportunistic investments, are a combination of cash provided by operations and borrowings under our loan agreements. Cash from operations, which when combined with our available borrowing capacity and ready access to capital markets, is expected to be more than adequate to fund our liquidity needs over the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. The company believes it has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its long-term needs for cash.\nContractual and Other Material Cash Obligations\nThe following table summarizes contractual and other material cash obligations as of October 31, 2022:\n(1)\nRefer to Note 10 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n(2)\nRefer to Note 11 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n(3)\nPension and postretirement plan funding amounts will be determined based on the future funded status of the plans and therefore cannot be estimated at this time. Refer to Note 7 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion.\n(4)\nPurchase obligations primarily represent commitments for materials used in our manufacturing processes that are not recorded in our Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nWe believe that the combination of present capital resources, cash from operations and unused financing sources such as our credit facilities, including our revolving credit facility, are more than adequate to meet cash requirements for the twelve months and the foreseeable future thereafter. There are no significant restrictions limiting the transfer of funds from international subsidiaries to the parent company.\nNordson Corporation 28\nNew Accounting Standards\nThere have been no new accounting standards issued which would require either disclosure or adoption during the current period by the Company.\nEffects of Foreign Currency\nThe impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on sales and operating results cannot be precisely measured due to fluctuating selling prices, sales volume, product mix and cost structures in each country where we operate. As a general rule, a weakening of the United States dollar relative to foreign currencies has a favorable effect on sales and net income, while a strengthening of the dollar has a detrimental effect.\nIn 2022, as compared with 2021, the United States dollar was generally stronger against foreign currencies. If 2021 exchange rates had been in effect during 2022, sales would have been approximately $103,829 higher and third-party costs would have been approximately $68,788 higher. In 2021, as compared with 2020, the United States dollar was generally weaker against foreign currencies. If 2020 exchange rates had been in effect during 2021, sales would have been approximately $55,200 lower and third-party costs would have been approximately $24,600 lower. These effects on reported sales do not include the impact of local price adjustments made in response to changes in currency exchange rates.\nTrends\nOur solid historical performance is attributed to our diverse geographic and end market participation and our long-term commitment to develop and provide quality products and worldwide service to meet our customers’ changing needs.\nSafe Harbor Statements Under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995\nThis annual report, particularly “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations,” contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

    "text": "We operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currencies are recorded and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign exchange contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts, primarily associated with the euro, yen and pound sterling, typically have maturities of 90 days or less, and generally require the exchange of foreign currencies for United States dollars at rates stated in the contracts. Gains and losses from changes in the market value of these contracts offset foreign exchange losses and gains, respectively, on the underlying transactions. We use foreign exchange contracts on a routine basis to help mitigate the risks related to transactions denominated in foreign currencies.\nRefer to Note 13 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion about our foreign currency transactions and the methods and assumptions used to record these transactions.\nA portion of our operations is financed with short-term and long-term borrowings and is subject to market risk arising from changes in interest rates.\nThe tables that follow present principal repayments and weighted-average interest rates on outstanding borrowings of fixed-rate debt.\nWe also have variable-rate long-term debt. The weighted average interest rate of this variable-rate debt was 1.74 percent at October 31, 2022 and 0.71 percent at October 31, 2021. A one percent increase in interest rates would have resulted in additional interest expense of approximately $2,841 on the variable rate long-term debt in 2022.\nNordson Corporation 30"

Unless the context otherwise indicates, all references to “we” or the “Company” mean Nordson Corporation.\nUnless otherwise noted, all references to years relate to our fiscal year.\nNote 1 —\nSignificant accounting policies\nConsolidation\n— The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Nordson Corporation and its 100%-owned and controlled subsidiaries. Investments in affiliates and joint ventures in which our ownership is\n50\npercent or less or in which we do not have control but have the ability to exercise significant influence, are accounted for under the equity method. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation.\nUse of estimates\n— The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the Consolidated Financial Statements and notes. Actual amounts could differ from these estimates.\nFiscal year\n— Our fiscal year is November 1 through October 31.\nRevenue recognition\n— A contract exists when it has approval and commitment from both parties, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of the consideration is probable. Revenue is recognized when performance obligations under the terms of the contract with a customer are satisfied. Generally, our revenue results from short-term, fixed-price contracts and primarily is recognized as of a point in time when the product is shipped or at a later point when the control of the product transfers to the customer. Revenue for undelivered items is deferred and included within Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. Revenues deferred as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 were not material.\nHowever, for certain contracts related to the sale of customer-specific products within our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment, revenue is recognized for these contracts over time as we satisfy performance obligations because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. The continuous transfer of control to the customer occurs as we enhance assets that are customer controlled and we are contractually entitled to payment for work performed to date plus a reasonable margin.\nAs control transfers over time for these products or services, revenue is recognized based on progress toward completion of the performance obligations. The selection method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We have elected to use the input method – costs incurred for these contracts because it best depicts the transfer of products or services to the customer based on incurring costs on the contract. Under this method, revenues are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Contract assets recognized are recorded in Prepaid expenses and other current assets and contract liabilities are recorded in Accrued liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets and were not material at October 31, 2022 or 2021. Revenue recognized over time represented approximately less than\nten\npercent of our overall consolidated revenues at October 31, 2022 or 2021.\nRevenue is measured as the amount of consideration we expect to receive in exchange for transferring products or services. Taxes, including sales and value add, that we collect concurrently with revenue-producing activities are excluded from revenue. As a practical expedient, we may exclude the assessment of whether goods or services are performance obligations, if they are immaterial in the context of the contract, and combine these with other performance obligations. While payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, we have determined that our contracts generally do not include a significant financing component. We have elected to apply the practical expedient to treat all shipping and handling costs as fulfillment costs, as a significant portion of these costs are incurred prior to transfer of control to the customer. We have also elected to apply the practical expedient to expense sales commissions as they are incurred, as the amortization period resulting from capitalizing the costs is one year or less. These costs are recorded within Selling, general and administrative expenses in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nWe offer assurance-type warranties on our products as well as separately sold warranty contracts. Revenue related to warranty contracts that are sold separately is recognized over the life of the warranty term and is not material. Certain arrangements may include installation, installation supervision, training and spare parts, which tend to be completed in a short period of time, at an insignificant cost, and utilizing skills not unique to us; therefore, these items are typically regarded as inconsequential or not material.\nWe disclose disaggregated revenues by operating segment and geography in accordance with the revenue standard and on the same basis used internally by the chief operating decision maker for evaluating performance of operating segments and for allocating resources. Refer to Note 16 for details on our operating segments.\nNordson Corporation 36\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nShipping and handling costs\n— Amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling are recorded as revenue. Shipping and handling expenses are included in cost of sales.\nAdvertising costs\n— Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $\n7,028\n, $\n5,986\nand $\n7,174\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nResearch and development\n— Investments in research and development are important to our long-term growth, enabling us to keep pace with changing customer and marketplace needs through the development of new products and new applications for existing products. We place strong emphasis on technology developments and improvements through internal engineering and research teams. Research and development costs are expensed as incurred and were $\n63,031\n, $\n59,422\nand $\n63,591\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nEarnings per share\n— Basic earnings per share are computed based on the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding during each year, while diluted earnings per share are based on the weighted-average number of common shares and common share equivalents outstanding. Common share equivalents consist of shares issuable upon exercise of stock options computed using the treasury stock method, as well as restricted stock and deferred stock-based compensation. Options whose exercise price is higher than the average market price are excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share because the effect would be anti-dilutive. Options for\n78\ncommon shares were excluded from the diluted earnings per share calculation in 2022 and\n46\nand\n95\noptions were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share in 2021 and 2020, respectively because their effect would have been anti-dilutive. Under the 2021 Stock Incentive and Award Plan, executive officers and selected other key employees receive common share awards based on corporate performance measures over\nthree\n-year performance periods. Awards for which performance measures have not been met were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share.\nCash and cash equivalents\n— Highly liquid instruments with maturities of\n90\ndays or less at date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents.\nAllowance for doubtful accounts\n— An allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments. The amount of the allowance is determined principally on the basis of past collection experience and known factors regarding specific customers. Accounts are written off against the allowance when it becomes evident that collection will not occur. Credit is extended to customers satisfying pre-defined credit criteria. We believe we have limited concentration of credit risk due to the diversity of our customer base.\nOur primary allowance for credit losses is the allowance for doubtful accounts, which is principally determined based on aging of receivables. Receivables are exposed to credit risk based on the customers' ability to pay which is influenced by, among other factors, their financial liquidity. We perform ongoing customer credit evaluation to maintain sufficient allowances for potential credit losses. Our segments perform credit evaluation and monitoring to estimate and manage credit risk through the review of customer information, credit ratings, approval and monitoring of customer credit limits, and assessment of market conditions. We may also require prepayments or bank guarantees from customers to mitigate credit risk. Our receivables are generally short-term in nature with a majority of receivables outstanding less than 90 days. Accounts receivable balances are written-off against the allowance if deemed uncollectible.\nAccounts receivable are net of an allowance for credit losses of $\n8,218\nand $\n7,522\nat October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, respectively. The provision for losses on receivables was $\n1,259\nfor the twelve months ended October 31, 2022 compared to $\n32\nfor the same period a year ago. The remaining change in the allowance for credit losses is principally related to the write-off of uncollectible accounts.\nInventories\n— Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Effective in the third quarter of 2022, we changed our accounting method for certain U.S. inventories from a last-in, first-out basis (LIFO) to a first-in, first-out basis (FIFO). Previously, the LIFO method was used to determine the cost of a portion of our inventories in the U.S. We believe this change in accounting method is preferable as it is consistent with how we manage our business, results in a uniform method to value our inventory across all regions of our business, improves comparability with our peers and is expected to better reflect the current value of inventory on the consolidated balance sheets. We applied this accounting change as a cumulative effect adjustment to cost of sales in the third quarter of 2022 and did not restate prior period financial statements because the impact was not material. Cost was determined using the LIFO method for\n16\npercent of consolidated inventories at October 31, 2021. Consolidated inventories would have been $\n4,216\nhigher than reported at October 31, 2021 had the FIFO method, which approximates current cost, been used for valuation of all inventories.\nProperty, plant and equipment and depreciation\n— Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost. Additions and improvements that extend the lives of assets are capitalized, while expenditures for repairs and maintenance are expensed as incurred. Plant and equipment are depreciated for financial reporting purposes using the straight-line method over the estimated\nNordson Corporation 37\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nuseful lives of the assets or, in the case of property under finance leases, over the terms of the leases. Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their useful lives.\nUseful lives are as follows:\nDepreciation expense is included in cost of sales and selling and administrative expenses. Internal use software costs are expensed or capitalized depending on whether they are incurred in the preliminary project stage, application development stage or the post-implementation stage. Amounts capitalized are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software beginning with the project’s completion. All re-engineering costs are expensed as incurred. Interest costs on significant capital projects are capitalized.\nNo\ninterest was capitalized in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nGoodwill and intangible assets\n— Goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. Goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to specific reporting units. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment testing is performed as of August 1. Testing is done more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of those assets.\nOther amortizable intangible assets, which consist primarily of patent/technology costs, customer relationships, noncompete agreements and trade names, are amortized over their useful lives on a straight-line basis.\nAt October 31, 2022, the weighted-average useful lives for each major category of amortizable intangible assets were:\nForeign currency translation\n— The financial statements of subsidiaries outside the United States are generally measured using the local currency as the functional currency. Assets and liabilities of these subsidiaries are translated at the rates of exchange at the balance sheet dates. Income and expense items are translated at average monthly rates of exchange. The resulting translation adjustments are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss), a separate component of shareholders’ equity. Generally, gains and losses from foreign currency transactions, including forward contracts, of these subsidiaries and the United States parent are included in net income. Gains and losses from intercompany foreign currency transactions of a long-term investment nature are included in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss\n—\nAccumulated other comprehensive loss at October 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of:\nWarranties\n— We offer warranties to our customers depending on the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement. A typical warranty program requires that we repair or replace defective products within a specified time period (generally\none year\n) measured from the date of delivery or first use. We record an estimate for future warranty-related costs based on actual historical return rates. Based on analysis of return rates and other factors, the adequacy of our warranty provisions is adjusted as necessary. The liability for warranty costs is included in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNordson Corporation 38\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nFollowing is a reconciliation of the product warranty liability as of  October 31, 2022 and 2021:\nNote 2 —\nRecently issued accounting standards\nThere have been no new accounting standards issued that would require either disclosure or adoption for 2022 by the Company.\nNote 3 —\nAcquisitions\nBusiness acquisitions have been accounted for using the acquisition method, with the acquired assets and liabilities recorded at estimated fair value on the dates of acquisition. The cost in excess of the net assets of the business acquired is included in goodwill. Operating results since the respective dates of acquisitions are included in the Consolidated Statement of Income.\n2022 acquisition\nOn November 1, 2021, we acquired\n100\npercent of NDC Technologies (NDC), a leading global provider of precision measurement solutions for in-line manufacturing process control. NDC's technology portfolio includes in-line measurement sensors, gauges and analyzers using near-infrared, laser, X-ray, optical and nucleonic technologies, as well as proprietary algorithms and software. We acquired NDC for an aggregate purchase price of $\n171,613\n, net of cash of approximately $\n7,533\nand other working capital adjustments of $\n2,763\n, utilizing cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $\n131,129\nand identifiable intangible assets of $\n31,130\nwere recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $\n10,800\nof tradenames (amortized over\n13\nyears), $\n10,000\nof technology (amortized over\n7\nyears), $\n9,500\nof customer relationships (amortized over\n4\nyears) and $\n830\nof non-compete agreements (amortized over\n3\nyears). Goodwill associated with this acquisition of $\n72,018\nis tax deductible. This acquisition is being reported in our Industrial Precision Solutions segment and the results of NDC are not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\n2020 acquisitions\nOn September 1, 2020, we acquired\n100\npercent of the outstanding shares of vivaMOS Ltd. (\"vivaMOS\"), a developer and fabricator of high-end large-area complementary metal–oxide–semiconductor (\"CMOS\") image sensors for a wide range of X-ray applications. We acquired vivaMOS for an aggregate purchase price of $\n17,154\nnet of cash and other closing adjustments of approximately $\n158\n, utilizing cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, goodwill of $\n14,394\nand identifiable intangible assets of $\n4,040\nwere recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $\n3,900\nof technology (amortized over\n10\nyears) and $\n140\nof non-compete agreements (amortized over\n3\nyears). Goodwill associated with this acquisition was not tax deductible. This acquisition is being reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment and the results of vivaMOS were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nOn June 1, 2020, we acquired\n100\npercent of the outstanding shares of Fluortek, Inc. (\"Fluortek\"), a precision plastic extrusion manufacturer that provides custom dimensioned tubing to the medical device industry. We acquired Fluortek for an aggregate purchase price of\n$\n125,260\n, net of cash and other closing adjustments of approximately $\n515\n, utilizing cash on hand. Based on the fair value of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed, property, plant and equipment and working capital – net of $\n19,843\n, goodwill of $\n76,047\nand identifiable intangible assets of $\n29,370\nwere recorded. The identifiable intangible assets consist primarily of $\n19,700\nof customer relationships (amortized over\n12\nyears), $\n7,400\nof technology (amortized over\n10\nyears), $\n1,500\nof tradenames (amortized over\n10\nyears) and $\n770\nof non-compete agreements (amortized over\n5\nyears). Goodwill associated with this acquisition was tax deductible. This acquisition is being reported in our Medical and Fluid Solutions segment and the results for Fluortek were not material to the our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNordson Corporation 39\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 4 —\nDivestiture\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we committed to a plan to sell our screws and barrels product line within our Industrial Precision Solutions operating segment and determined the criteria to be classified as held for sale were met. We entered into a letter of intent to sell the screws and barrels product line in October 2020, and in December 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement with the buyer. The assets and liabilities were presented as held for sale in the Condensed Consolidated Balance Sheets and measured at the lower of carrying value or fair value less cost to sell from October 31, 2020 until the transaction was completed on February 1, 2021. Before measuring the fair value less costs to sell of the disposal group as a whole, we first reviewed individual assets and liabilities to determine if any fair value adjustments were required and concluded no individual asset impairments were required. Then, based on the definitive agreement entered into by us and the buyer, we determined the fair value of the disposal group to be equal to the selling price, less costs to sell. Based on this review, we recorded a non-cash, assets held for sale impairment charge of $\n87,371\nin 2020. Excluding the non-cash, assets held for sale impairment charge recorded in the fourth quarter of 2020, the operating results of the screws and barrels product line were not material to our Consolidated Financial Statements for any period presented. There were no significant adjustments in 2021 to the loss recognized in 2020.\nNordson Corporation 40\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 6 —\nGoodwill and intangible assets\nWe account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of ASC 350 and account for business combinations using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly, the assets and liabilities of the entities acquired are recorded at their estimated fair values at the acquisition date. Goodwill is the excess of purchase price over the fair value of tangible and identifiable intangible net assets acquired in various business combinations. Goodwill is not amortized but is subject to annual impairment testing. Our annual impairment testing is performed as of August 1. Testing is done more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the fair value of a reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of those assets. We assess the fair value of reporting units on a non-recurring basis using a quantitative analysis that uses a combination of the discounted cash flow method of the Income Approach and the guideline public company method of the Market Approach, and compare the result against the reporting unit’s carrying value of net assets. The implied fair value of our reporting units is determined based on significant unobservable inputs, as discussed below; accordingly, these inputs fall within Level 3 of the fair value hierarchy. The discounted cash flow method (Income Approach) uses assumptions for revenue growth, operating margin and working capital turnover that are based on management’s strategic plans tempered by performance trends and reasonable expectations about those trends. Terminal value calculations employ a published formula known as the Gordon Growth Model Method that essentially captures the present value of perpetual cash flows beyond the last projected period assuming a constant Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) methodology and growth rate. For each reporting unit, a sensitivity analysis is performed to vary the discount and terminal growth rates in order to provide a range of reasonableness for detecting impairment. Discount rates are developed using a WACC methodology. The WACC represents the blended average required rate of return for equity and debt capital based on observed market return data and company specific risk factors.\nIn the application of the guideline public company method (Market Approach), fair value is determined using transactional evidence for similar publicly traded equity. The comparable company guideline group is determined based on relative similarities to each reporting unit since exact correlations are not available. An indication of fair value for each reporting unit is based on the placement of each reporting unit within a range of multiples determined for its comparable guideline company group. Valuation multiples are derived by dividing latest twelve-month performance for revenues and Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation and Amortization (EBITDA) into total invested capital, which is the sum of traded equity plus interest bearing debt less cash. These multiples are applied against the revenue and EBITDA of each reporting unit. While the implied indications of fair value using the guideline public company method yield meaningful results, the discounted cash flow method of the income approach includes management’s thoughtful projections and insights as to what the reporting units will accomplish in the near future. Accordingly, the reasonable, implied fair value of each reporting unit is a blend based on the consideration of both the Income and Market approaches.\nAn impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit, as calculated in the quantitative analysis described above. Based on our annual impairment tests in 2022, 2021 and 2020, the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value, and accordingly, we did not record any goodwill impairment charges in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2022, we realigned our former\ntwo\noperating segments into\nthree\n: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. Previously, Advanced Technology Solutions was comprised of Medical and Fluid Solutions and the former Advanced Technology Solutions.  Our segment change did not have any impact on our reporting units.\nOur reporting units include components of the Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and the Advanced Technology Solutions segments.\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill during 2022 by operating segment:\nThe increase in goodwill for 2022 was due to the acquisition of NDC. See Note 3 for additional details.\nNordson Corporation 41\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nChanges in the carrying amount of goodwill during 2021 by operating segment:\nAccumulated impairment losses, which were recorded in 2009, were $\n232,789\nof which $\n229,173\nrelated to the Advanced Technology Solutions segment and $\n3,616\nrelated to the Industrial Precision Solutions segment.\nInformation regarding intangible assets subject to amortization:\nAmortization expense for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n50,825\n, $\n50,551\nand $\n56,979\n, respectively. See Note 3 for details regarding intangibles recorded due to the acquisition of NDC.\nEstimated amortization expense for each of the five succeeding years:\nNote 7 —\nRetirement, pension and other postretirement plans\nRetirement plans\n— We have funded contributory retirement plans covering certain employees. Our contributions are primarily determined by the terms of the plans, subject to the limitation that they shall not exceed the amounts deductible for income tax purposes. We also sponsor unfunded contributory supplemental retirement plans for certain employees. Generally, benefits under these plans vest gradually over a period of approximately\nthree years\nfrom date of employment, and are based on the employee’s contribution. The expense applicable to retirement plans for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was approximately $\n26,635\n, $\n22,983\nand $\n20,265\n, respectively.\nPension plans\n— We have various pension plans covering a portion of our United States and international employees. Pension plan benefits are generally based on years of employment and, for salaried employees, the level of compensation. Actuarially determined amounts are contributed to United States plans to provide sufficient assets to meet future benefit payment\nNordson Corporation 42\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nrequirements. We also sponsor an unfunded supplemental pension plan for certain employees. International subsidiaries fund their pension plans according to local requirements.\nDuring the second quarter of 2022, we completed a partial plan settlement transaction in regards to\ntwo\nof our U.S. pension plans in which plan assets amounting to $\n171,181\nwere used to purchase a group annuity contract from The Prudential Insurance Company of America (Prudential). The settlement resulted in a loss of $\n41,221\n, which is included in Pension settlement charge for U.S. Plans on the Consolidated Statements of Income. This transaction relieved the Company of its responsibility for the pension obligation related to certain retired employees and transferred the obligation and payment responsibility to Prudential for retirement benefits owed to approximately\n1,500\nretirees and other beneficiaries. The annuity contract covered retirees who commenced receiving benefits on or before November 1, 2021. The monthly retirement benefit payment amounts currently received by retirees and their beneficiaries did not change as a result of this transaction. Plan participants not included in the transaction remain in the plans and responsibility for payment of the retirement benefits remains with the Company.\nA reconciliation of the benefit obligations, plan assets, accrued benefit cost and the amount recognized in financial statements for pension plans is as follows:\nNordson Corporation 43\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe net actuarial gain included in the projected benefit obligation for the United States pension plans for 2022 was primarily due to higher discount rates partially offset by an increase in the compensation increase assumption.  The net actuarial loss included in the projected benefit obligation for the United States pension plans for 2021 was primarily due to updated census data partially offset by gains due to changes in the discount rates.\nAmounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive (gain) loss:\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive loss (income):\nInformation regarding the funded status of the Company's plans is as follows:\nNet periodic pension costs include the following components:\nNordson Corporation 44\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNet periodic pension\ncost for 2022, 2021 and 2020 also included settlement losses of $\n298\n, $\n4,143\nand $\n2,508\n, respectively, due to lump sum retirement payments.  Net periodic pension cost for 2022 included a curtailment gain of $\n2,112\ndue to the freeze of an international defined benefit plan.\nThe components of net periodic pension cost other than service cost are included in Pension settlement charge for U.S. Plans and Other – net in our\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the valuation of pension benefits were as follows:\nThe amortization of prior service cost is determined using a straight-line amortization of the cost over the average remaining service period of employees expected to receive benefits under the plans.\nThe discount rate reflects the current rate at which pension liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. The discount rate used considers a yield derived from matching projected pension payments with maturities of a portfolio of available bonds that receive the highest rating given from a recognized investments ratings agency. The changes in the discount rates in 2022, 2021 and 2020 are due to changes in yields for these types of investments as a result of the economic environment.\nIn determining the expected return on plan assets using the calculated value of plan assets, we consider both historical performance and an estimate of future long-term rates of return on assets similar to those in our plans. We consult with and consider the opinions of financial and other professionals in developing appropriate return assumptions. The rate of compensation increase is based on management’s estimates using historical experience and expected increases in rates.\nThe international plans include a cash balance plan with promised interest crediting rates. The weighted average crediting rates were\n0.60\n%,\n0.50\n% and\n0.40\n% for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nNet actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when exceeding the accounting corridor, which is set at 10 percent of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations.\nGains or losses within the corridor remain in other comprehensive income and are retested in subsequent measurements. Gains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If substantially all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used.\nThe allocation of pension plan assets as of October 31, 2022 and 2021 is as follows:\nOur investment objective for defined benefit plan assets is to meet the plans’ benefit obligations, while minimizing the potential for future required plan contributions.\nNordson Corporation 45\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nOur United States plans comprise\n90\npercent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. In general, the investment strategies focus on asset class diversification, liquidity to meet benefit payments and an appropriate balance of long-term investment return and risk. Target ranges for asset allocations are determined by dynamically matching the actuarial projections of the plans’ future liabilities and benefit payments with expected long-term rates of return on the assets, taking into account investment return volatility and correlations across asset classes. For 2022, the target in “return-seeking assets” is\n30\npercent and\n70\npercent in longer duration fixed income assets. Plan assets are diversified across multiple investment managers and are invested in liquid funds that are selected to track broad market indices. Investment risk is carefully controlled with plan assets rebalanced to target allocations on a periodic basis and continual monitoring of investment managers’ performance relative to the guidelines established with each investment manager.\nOur international plans comprise\n10\npercent of the Company's worldwide pension assets. Asset allocations are developed on a country-specific basis. Our investment strategy is to cover pension obligations with insurance contracts or to employ independent managers to invest the assets.\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets at October 31, 2022 by asset category are in the table below:\nNordson Corporation 46\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe fair values of our pension plan assets at October 31, 2021 by asset category are in the table below:\nThese investment funds did not own a significant number of Nordson Corporation common shares for any year presented.\nThe inputs and methodology used to measure fair value of plan assets are consistent with those described in Note 12. Following are the valuation methodologies used to measure these assets:\n•\nMoney market funds\n- Money market funds are public investment vehicles that are valued with a net asset value of one dollar. This is a quoted price in an active market and is classified as Level 1.\n•\nEquity securities\n- Common stocks and mutual funds are valued at the closing price reported on the active market on which the individual securities are traded and are classified as Level 1.\n•\nFixed income securities\n- U.S. Treasury bills reflect the closing price on the active market in which the securities are traded and are classified as Level 1. Securities of U.S. agencies are valued using bid evaluations and are classified as Level 2. Corporate fixed income securities are valued using evaluated prices, such as dealer quotes, bids and offers and are therefore classified as Level 2.\n•\nInsurance contracts\n- Insurance contracts are investments with various insurance companies. The contract value represents the best estimate of fair value. These contracts do not hold any specific assets. These investments are classified as Level 3.\n•\nReal estate collective funds\n– These funds are valued using the net asset value of the underlying properties. Net asset value is calculated using a combination of key inputs, such as revenue and expense growth rates, terminal capitalization rates and discount rates.\n•\nPooled investment funds\n- These are public investment vehicles valued using the net asset value. The net asset value is based on the value of the assets owned by the plan, less liabilities. These investments are not quoted on an active exchange.\nNordson Corporation 47\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following tables present an analysis of changes during the years ended October 31, 2022 and 2021 in Level 3 plan assets, by plan asset class, for U.S. and international pension plans using significant unobservable inputs to measure fair value:\nContributions to pension plans in 2022 are estimated to be approximately $\n3,105\n.\nRetiree pension benefit payments, which include expected future service, are anticipated to be paid as follows:\nOther postretirement plans\n- We sponsor an unfunded postretirement health care benefit plan covering certain of our United States employees. Employees hired after January 1, 2002, are not eligible to participate in this plan. For eligible retirees under the age of\n65\nwho enroll in the plan, the plan is contributory in nature, with retiree contributions in the form of premiums that are adjusted annually. For eligible retirees age\n65\nand older who enroll in the plan, the plan delivers a benefit in the form of a Health Reimbursement Account (HRA), which retirees use for eligible reimbursable expenses, including premiums paid for purchase of a Medicare supplement plan or other out-of-pocket medical expenses such as deductibles or co-pays.\nNordson Corporation 48\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of the benefit obligations, accrued benefit cost and the amount recognized in financial statements for other postretirement plans is as follows:\nThe following table summarizes the changes in accumulated other comprehensive (gain) loss:\nNordson Corporation 49\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNet postretirement benefit costs include the following components:\nThe components of net\npostretirement\nbenefit cost other than service cost are included in Other – net in our Consolidated Statements of Income.\nThe weighted average assumptions used in the valuation of postretirement benefits were as follows:\nThe weighted average health care trend rates reflect expected increases in the Company’s portion of the obligation.\nNet actuarial gains or losses are amortized to expense on a plan-by-plan basis when exceeding the accounting corridor, which is set at 10 percent of the greater of the plan assets or benefit obligations.\nGains or losses outside of the corridor are subject to amortization over an average employee future service period that differs by plan. If substantially all of the plan’s participants are no longer actively accruing benefits, the average life expectancy is used. Contributions to postretirement plans in 2023 are estimated to be approximately $\n3,230\n.\nRetiree postretirement benefit payments are anticipated to be paid as follows:\nNordson Corporation 50\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 8 —\nIncome taxes\nIncome tax expense includes the following:\nEarnings before income taxes of domestic operations, which are calculated after intercompany profit eliminations, were $\n302,549\n, $\n279,701\nand $\n111,704\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nOur income tax provision for 2022 included a tax benefit of $\n3,273\ndue to our share-based payment transactions.\nOur income tax provision for 2021 included a tax benefit of $\n5,982\ndue to our share-based payment transactions.\nOur income tax provision for 2020 included a tax benefit of $\n15,661\ndue to our share-based payment transactions. Income before taxes in 2020 included a non-cash, assets held for sale impairment charge of $\n87,371\nrelated to our commitment to sell our screws and barrels product line within the Adhesives reporting unit under our Industrial Precision Solutions segment and the tax benefit of the impairment was $\n15,254\n. A portion of the impairment charge did not have related tax benefits.\nA reconciliation of the U.S. statutory federal rate to the worldwide consolidated effective tax rate follows:\nEarnings before income taxes of international operations, which are calculated before intercompany profit elimination entries, were $\n346,730\n, $\n294,475\nand $\n189,785\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Deferred income taxes are not provided on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries that are intended to be permanently invested in their operations. These undistributed earnings represent the post-income tax earnings under U.S. GAAP not adjusted for previously taxed income which aggregated approximately $\n1,485,360\nand $\n1,255,112\nat October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Should these earnings be distributed, applicable foreign tax credits, distributions of previously taxed income and utilization of other attributes would substantially offset taxes due upon the distribution. It is not practical to estimate the amount of additional taxes that might be payable on these basis differences because of the multiple methods by which these differences could reverse and the impact of withholding, U.S. state and local taxes and currency translation considerations.\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, total unrecognized tax benefits were $\n2,872\nand $\n3,720\n, respectively. The amounts that, if recognized, would impact the effective tax rate were $\n2,769\nand $\n3,567\nat October 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. During 2022, unrecognized tax benefits related primarily to domestic positions and, as recognized, a substantial portion of the gross unrecognized tax benefits were offset against assets recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nNordson Corporation 51\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nA reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits for 2022, 2021 and 2020 is as follows:\nAt October 31, 2022 and 2021, we had accrued interest and penalty expense related to unrecognized tax benefits of $\n541\nand $\n859\n, respectively. We include interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense. Penalties, if incurred, would be recognized as other income (expense).\nWe are subject to United States Federal income tax as well as income taxes in numerous state and foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to examination in the U.S. by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the 2019 through 2022 tax years; tax years prior to the 2019 year are closed to further examination by the IRS. Generally, major state and foreign jurisdiction tax years remain open to examination for tax years after 2016. Within the next twelve months, it is reasonably possible that certain statute of limitations periods would expire, which could result in a minimal decrease in our unrecognized tax benefits.\nSignificant components of deferred tax assets and liabilities are as follows:\nAt October 31, 2022, we had $\n12,648\nof tax credit carryforwards, $\n5,053\nof which expires in 2028-2032 and $\n7,595\nof which has an indefinite carryforward period. We also had $\n34,352\nof state operating loss carryforwards, $\n16,965\nof foreign operating loss carryforwards, and a $\n3,570\ncapital loss carryforward, of which $\n41,269\nwill expire in 2023 through 2038, and $\n13,618\nof which has an indefinite carryforward period. The net change in the valuation allowance was a decrease of $\n4,011\nin 2022 and a decrease of $\n8,092\nin 2021. The valuation allowance of $\n10,130\nat October 31, 2022, related primarily to tax credits and loss carryforwards that may expire before being realized. We continue to assess the need for valuation allowances against deferred tax assets based on determinations of whether it is more likely than not that deferred tax benefits will be realized.\nNote 9 —\nBank lines of credit\nBank lines of credit are summarized as follows:\nNordson Corporation 52\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 10 —\nLong-term debt\nA summary of long-term debt is as follows:\nRevolving credit agreement\n— In April 2019, we entered into a $\n850,000\nunsecured multi-currency credit facility with a group of banks, which amended, restated and extended our then existing syndicated revolving credit agreement. This facility has a\nfive-year\nterm and includes a $\n75,000\nsubfacility for swing-line loans. It expires in April 2024. At October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, we had\nno\nbalances outstanding under this facility.\nSenior notes, due 2023-2025\n— These unsecured fixed-rate notes entered into in 2012 with a group of insurance companies have a remaining weighted-average life of\n1.47\nyears. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2022 was\n3.10\npercent.\nSenior notes, due 2023-2027\n— These unsecured fixed-rate notes entered into in 2015 with a group of insurance companies have a remaining weighted-average life of\n2.44\nyears. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2022 was\n3.10\npercent.\nSenior notes, due 2023-2030\n—\nThese unsecured fixed-rate notes entered in 2018 with a group of insurance companies have a remaining weighted-average life of\n3.04\nyears. The weighted-average interest rate at October 31, 2022 was\n3.90\npercent.\nEuro loan, due 2023\n— In March 2020 we amended, restated and extended the term of our existing term loan facility with Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited. The interest rate is variable based on the EURIBOR rate. The term loan facility provides for the following term loans due in two tranches: €\n115,000\nis due in March 2023 and an additional €\n150,000\nthat was drawn down in March 2020 is due in March 2023. The weighted average interest rate at October 31, 2022 was\n0.71\npercent.\nWe were in compliance with all covenants at October 31, 2022 and the amount we could borrow would not have been limited by any debt covenants.\nAnnual maturities\n— The annual maturities of long-term debt for the five years subsequent to October 31, 2022, are as follows: $\n392,537\nin 2023; $\n110,643\nin 2024; $\n85,642\nin 2025; $\n50,000\nin 2026 and $\n10,000\nin 2027.\nNote 11 —\nLeases\nWe review new contracts to determine if the contracts include a lease. To the extent a lease agreement includes an extension option that is reasonably certain to be exercised, we have recognized those amounts as part of the right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. We combine lease and non-lease components, such as common area maintenance, in the calculation of the lease assets and related liabilities. As most lease agreements do not provide an implicit rate, we use an incremental borrowing rate (IBR) based on information available at the lease commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments and to help classify the lease as operating or financing. We calculate the IBR based on a bond yield curve which considers secured borrowing rates based on our credit rating and current economic environment, as well as other publicly available data.\nWe lease certain manufacturing facilities, warehouse space, machinery and equipment, and vehicles. We often have options to renew lease terms for buildings and other assets. We evaluate renewal and termination options at the lease commencement date to determine if we are reasonably certain to exercise the option on the basis of economic factors. Leases with an initial term of 12 months or less (short-term leases) are not recorded on the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term, with variable lease payments recognized in the period those payments occur. Variable payments for leases primarily relate to future rates or amounts, miles, or other quantifiable usage factors which are not determinable at the time the lease agreement commences. Finance lease assets are recorded in Property, plant and equipment – net on the Consolidated Balance Sheet with related amortization recorded in depreciation expense on the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows. As of October 31, 2022, we had no material leases that had yet to commence.\nNordson Corporation 53\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nAdditional lease information is summarized below for the twelve months ended October 31:\n(1)\nLease costs are recorded in both Cost of sales and Selling and administrative expenses on the Consolidated Statements of Income.\nSupplemental cash flow information is summarized below for the twelve months ended October 31, 2022:\nThe following table reconciles the undiscounted cash flows for five years and thereafter to the operating and finance lease liabilities recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of October 31, 2022. The reconciliation excludes short-term leases that are not recognized on the Consolidated Balance Sheet.\nRental expense for operating leases during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n20,479\n, $\n20,618\nand $\n22,061\n, respectively.\nCapitalized net finance leases included in property, plant and equipment during the fiscal years ended October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021 was $\n15,176\nand $\n19,745\n, respectively.\nNote 12 —\nFair value measurements\nThe inputs to the valuation techniques used to measure fair value are classified into the following categories:\nLevel 1: Quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.\nLevel 2: Observable market-based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data.\nLevel 3: Unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data.\nNordson Corporation 54\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nThe following tables present the classification of our assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis:\n(a)\nWe enter into foreign currency forward contracts to reduce the risk of foreign currency exposures resulting from receivables, payables, intercompany receivables, intercompany payables and loans denominated in foreign currencies. Foreign exchange contracts are valued using market exchange rates. These foreign exchange contracts are not designated as hedges.\n(b)\nExecutive officers and other highly compensated employees may defer up to\n100\npercent of their salary and annual cash incentive compensation and for executive officers, up to\n90\npercent of their long-term incentive compensation, into various non-qualified deferred compensation plans. Deferrals can be allocated to various market performance measurement funds. Changes in the value of compensation deferred under these plans are recognized each period based on the fair value of the underlying measurement funds.\nFair value disclosures related to goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets are disclosed in Note 6.\nThe carrying amounts and fair values of financial instruments, other than cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable, are shown in the table below.\nThe carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximate fair value due to the short-term nature of these instruments.\nLong-term debt is valued by discounting future cash flows at currently available rates for borrowing arrangements with similar terms and conditions, which are considered to be Level 2 inputs under the fair value hierarchy. The carrying amount of long-term debt is shown net of unamortized debt issuance costs as described in Note 10.\nNote 13 —\nDerivative financial instruments\nWe operate internationally and enter into intercompany transactions denominated in foreign currencies. Consequently, we are subject to market risk arising from exchange rate movements between the dates foreign currency transactions occur and the dates they are settled. We regularly use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our risks related to most of these transactions. These contracts usually have maturities of\n90\ndays or less and generally require us to exchange foreign currencies for U.S. dollars at maturity, at rates stated in the contracts. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments under U.S. GAAP. Accordingly, the changes in the fair value of the foreign currency forward contracts are recognized in each accounting period in “Other – net” on the Consolidated Statement of Income together with the transaction gain or loss from the related balance sheet position.\nIn 2022, we recognized net losses of $\n4,937\non foreign currency forward contracts and net gains of $\n11,207\nfrom the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. In 2021, we recognized net gains of $\n1,485\non foreign currency forward contracts and net\nNordson Corporation 55\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nlosses of $\n7,411\nfrom the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. In 2020, we recognized net losses of $\n5,899\non foreign currency forward contracts and net gains of $\n4,367\nfrom the change in fair value of balance sheet positions. The fair values of our foreign currency forward contract assets and liabilities are included in Receivables-net and Accrued liabilities, respectively in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.\nThe following table summarizes, by currency, the contracts outstanding at October 31, 2022 and 2021:\nWe are exposed to credit-related losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to financial instruments. These financial instruments include cash deposits and foreign currency forward contracts. We periodically monitor the credit ratings of these counterparties in order to minimize our exposure. Our customers represent a wide variety of industries and geographic regions. As of October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were no significant concentrations of credit risk.\nNote 14 —\nCapital shares\nPreferred\n— We have authorized\n10,000\nSeries A convertible preferred shares without par value.\nNo\npreferred shares were outstanding in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nCommon\n— We have\n160,000\nauthorized common shares without par value. At October 31, 2022 and 2021, there were\n98,023\ncommon shares issued. At October 31, 2022 and 2021, the number of outstanding common shares, net of treasury shares, was\n57,111\nand\n58,154\n, respectively.\nCommon shares repurchased as part of publicly announced programs during 2022, 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\nThese amounts exclude share repurchases associated with employee equity award exercises and vesting.\nNordson Corporation 56\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nNote 15 —\nStock-based compensation\nDuring the 2021 Annual Meeting of Shareholders, our shareholders approved the Nordson Corporation 2021 Stock Incentive and Award Plan (the “2021 Plan”) as the successor to the Amended and Restated 2012 Stock Incentive and Award Plan (the \"2012 Plan\"). The 2021 plan provides for the granting of stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted shares, restricted share units, performance shares, cash awards and other stock or performance-based incentives. A maximum of\n900\ncommon shares were authorized for grant under the 2021 Plan plus the number of shares that were available to be granted under the 2012 Plan. As of October 31, 2022, a total of\n2,122\ncommon shares were available to be granted under the 2021 Plan.\nStock options\n— Nonqualified or incentive stock options may be granted to our employees and directors. Generally, options granted to employees may be exercised beginning\none year\nfrom the date of grant at a rate\nnot exceeding 25 percent per year\nand expire\n10\nyears from the date of grant. Vesting accelerates upon a qualified termination in connection with a change in control. In the event of termination of employment due to early retirement or normal retirement at age\n65\n, options granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination are forfeited, and vesting continues post retirement for all other unvested options granted. In the event of disability or death, all unvested stock options granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason results in forfeiture of unvested options and vested options in certain circumstances. The amortized cost of options is accelerated if the retirement eligibility date occurs before the normal vesting date. Option exercises are satisfied through the issuance of treasury shares on a first-in, first-out basis. We recognized compensation expense related to stock options of $\n7,265\n, $\n6,946\nand $\n10,087\nfor 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to stock options during 2022:\nSummarized information on currently outstanding options follows:\nAs of October 31, 2022, there was $\n6,663\nof total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options. That cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of approximately\n1.0\nyear.\nThe fair value of each option grant was estimated at the date of the grant using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:\nThe weighted-average expected volatility used to value options granted in 2022, 2021 and 2020 was\n30.6\npercent,\n31.0\npercent and\n25.4\npercent, respectively.\nNordson Corporation 57\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nHistorical information was the primary basis for the selection of the expected volatility, expected dividend yield and the expected lives of the options. The risk-free interest rate was selected based upon yields of United States Treasury issues with terms equal to the expected life of the option being valued.\nThe weighted average grant date fair value of stock options granted during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n78.88\n, $\n56.02\nand $\n38.57\n, respectively.\nThe total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n15,376\n, $\n32,791\nand $\n65,783\n, respectively.\nCash received from the exercise of stock options for 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $\n12,124\n, $\n31,780\nand $\n50,853\n, respectively.\nRestricted shares and restricted share units\n— We may grant restricted shares and/or restricted share units to our employees and directors. These shares or units may not be transferred for a designated period of time (generally\none\nto\nthree years\n) defined at the date of grant\n.\nWe may also grant continuation awards in the form of restricted share units with cliff vesting and a performance measure that must be achieved for the restricted share units to vest.\nFor employee recipients, in the event of termination of employment due to early retirement, with consent of the Company, restricted shares and units granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination are forfeited, and other restricted shares and units vest on a pro-rata basis, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of termination of employment due to normal retirement at age\n65\n, restricted shares and units granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination are forfeited, and, for other restricted shares and units, the restriction period applicable to restricted shares will lapse and the shares will vest and be transferable and all unvested units will become vested in full, subject to the consent of the Compensation Committee. In the event of a recipient's disability or death, all restricted shares and units granted within\n12\nmonths prior to termination fully vest. Termination for any other reason prior to the lapse of any restrictions or vesting of units results in forfeiture of the shares or units.\nFor non-employee directors, all restrictions lapse in the event of disability or death of the non-employee director. Termination of service as a director for any other reason within one year of date of grant results in a pro-rata vesting of shares or units.\nAs shares or units are issued, stock-based compensation equivalent to the fair market value on the date of grant is expensed over the vesting period.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to restricted shares during 2022:\nAs of October 31, 2022, there was $\n331\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to restricted shares. The cost is expected to be amortized over a weighted average period of\n0.3\nyears. The amount charged to expense related to restricted shares was $\n1,096\n, $\n2,054\nand $\n3,956\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts included common share dividends of $\n19\n, $\n43\nand $\n87\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to restricted share units in 2022:\nAs of October 31, 2022, there was $\n8,790\nof remaining expense to be recognized related to outstanding restricted share units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of\n0.9\nyears. The amounts charged to expense related to restricted share units in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were $\n8,403\n, $\n6,264\nand $\n1,181\n, respectively. Restricted share unit expense increased in 2021 compared to prior years as the granting of restricted share units has generally replaced the granting of stock options for key employees.\nNordson Corporation 58\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nPerformance share incentive awards\n— Executive officers and selected other key employees are eligible to receive common share-based incentive awards. Payouts, in the form of unrestricted common shares, vary based on the degree to which corporate financial performance exceeds predetermined threshold, target and maximum performance goals over\nthree-year\nperformance periods. No payout will occur unless threshold performance is achieved\n.\nThe amount of compensation expense is based upon current performance projections and the percentage of the requisite service that has been rendered. The calculations are based upon the grant date fair value which is principally driven by the stock price on the date of grant or a Monte Carlo valuation for awards with market conditions. The per share values were $\n260.60\n, $\n273.50\nand $\n221.94\nfor 2022; $\n202.05\nfor 2021; and $\n201.50\nmodified per share value compared to original per share values of $\n160.02\n, $\n133.01\nand $\n184.04\nfor 2020. The amount charged to expense for executive officers and selected other key employees in 2022 was $\n13,626\nand $\n7,178\nin 2021 while the amount credited to expense in 2020 was $\n2,732\n. The cumulative amount recorded in shareholders’ equity at October 31, 2022 and 2021 was $\n20,641\nand $\n7,015\n, respectively. As of October 31, 2022, there was $\n8,029\nof unrecognized compensation cost related to performance share incentive awards.\nDeferred compensation\n— Our executive officers and other highly compensated employees may elect to defer up to\n100\npercent of their base pay and cash incentive compensation and, for executive officers, up to\n90\npercent of their share-based performance incentive award payout each year. Additional share units are credited for quarterly dividends paid on our common shares. Expense related to dividends paid under this plan was $\n72\n, $\n96\nand $\n276\nfor 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively\n.\nDeferred directors’ compensation\n— Non-employee directors may defer all or part of their cash and equity-based compensation until retirement. Cash compensation may be deferred as cash or as share equivalent units. Deferred cash amounts are recorded as liabilities, and share equivalent units are recorded as equity. Additional share equivalent units are earned when common share dividends are declared.\nThe following table summarizes activity related to director deferred compensation share equivalent units during 2022:\nThe amount charged to expense related to director deferred compensation was $\n305\n, $\n262\nand $\n175\nin 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nShares reserved for future issuance\n— At October 31, 2022, there were\n1,640\nof common shares reserved for future issuance through the exercise of outstanding options or rights\n.\nNote 16 —\nOperating segments and geographic area data\nWe conduct business in\nthree\nprimary operating segments: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. The composition of segments and measure of segment profitability is consistent with that used by our chief operating decision maker. The primary measure used by the chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions about allocating resources to the segments and assessing performance is operating profit, which equals sales less cost of sales and certain operating expenses. Items below the operating profit line of the Consolidated Statement of Income (interest and investment income, interest expense and other income/expense) are excluded from the measure of segment profitability reviewed by our chief operating decision maker and are not presented by operating segment. The accounting policies of the segments are the same as those described in Note 1, Significant Accounting Policies.\nEffective in the fourth quarter of 2022, we realigned our former\ntwo\noperating segments into\nthree\n: Industrial Precision Solutions, Medical and Fluid Solutions, and Advanced Technology Solutions. Existing product lines were unchanged as part of this new structure. We made changes to realign our management team and our operating segments. This realignment gives us better visibility into our medical and electronics platforms, which have grown significantly through both organic and acquisitive opportunities. The revised operating segments better reflect how we now manage the Company, allocate resources and assess performance of the businesses. Certain reclassifications have been made to our segment disclosures, principally related to this segment change. We also revised our geographic regions, such that the United States and Japan are now included in the Americas and Asia Pacific, respectively. As such, our geographical regions as used throughout this report include the Americas (United States, Canada, Mexico and Central and South America), Asia Pacific (including Japan) and Europe.\nNordson Corporation 59\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nIndustrial Precision Solutions:\nThis segment is focused on delivering proprietary dispensing and processing technology, both standard and highly customized equipment, to diverse end markets. Product lines commonly reduce material consumption, increase line efficiency through precision dispense and measurement and control, and enhance product brand and appearance. Components are used for dispensing adhesives, coatings, paint, finishes, sealants and other materials. This segment primarily serves the industrial, consumer durables and non-durables markets.\nMedical and Fluid Solutions:\nThis segment includes the Company’s fluid management solutions for medical, high-tech industrial and other diverse end markets. Related plastic tubing, balloons, catheters, syringes, cartridges, tips and fluid connection components are used to dispense or control fluids within customers’ medical devices or products, as well as production processes.\nAdvanced Technology Solutions:\nThis segment is focused on products serving electronics end markets.  Advanced Technology Solutions products integrate our proprietary product technologies found in progressive stages of an electronics customer’s production processes, such as surface treatment, precisely controlled dispensing of material and test and inspection to ensure quality and reliability. Applications include, but are not limited to, semiconductors, printed circuit boards, electronic components and automotive electronics.\nNo single customer accounted for 10 percent or more of sales in 2022, 2021 or 2020.\nThe following table presents information about our reportable segments:\n(a)\nCorporate assets are principally cash and cash equivalents, deferred income taxes, leases, headquarter facilities, the major portion of our enterprise management system and intangible assets. Includes assets held for sale in 2020, see Note 4.\n(b)\nOperating segment identifiable assets include notes and accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts, inventories net of reserves, property, plant and equipment net of accumulated depreciation and goodwill.\nNordson Corporation 60\nNotes to Consolidated Financial Statements\n—\n(Continued)\nWe have significant sales and long-lived assets in the following geographic areas:\nLong-lived assets includes property, plant and equipment - net and operating right of use lease assets, which were recorded as a result of the new lease standard as codified in ASC 842 and excludes amounts held for sale in 2020, see Note 4.\nA reconciliation of total assets for reportable segments to total consolidated assets is as follows:\nNote 17 —\nSupplemental information for the statement of cash flows\nNote 18 —\nContingencies\nWe are involved in pending or potential litigation regarding environmental, product liability, patent, contract, employee and other matters arising from the normal course of business.\nIncluding the environmental matter discussed below, after consultation with legal counsel, we do not believe that losses in excess of the amounts we have accrued would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition, quarterly or annual operating results or cash flows.\nWe have voluntarily agreed with the City of New Richmond, Wisconsin and other Potentially Responsible Parties to share costs associated with the remediation of the City of New Richmond municipal landfill (the “Site”) and the construction of a potable water delivery system serving the impacted area down gradient of the Site. At October 31, 2022 and October 31, 2021, our accrual for the ongoing operation, maintenance and monitoring obligation at the Site was $\n266\nand $\n319\n, respectively. The liability for environmental remediation represents management’s best estimate of the probable and reasonably estimable undiscounted costs related to known remediation obligations. The accuracy of our estimate of environmental liability is affected by several uncertainties such as additional requirements that may be identified in connection with remedial activities, the complexity and evolution of environmental laws and regulations, and the identification of presently unknown remediation requirements. Consequently, our liability could be greater than our current estimate. However, we do not expect that the costs associated with remediation will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations.\nNote 19 —\nSubsequent Events\nOn November 3, 2022, the Company completed the acquisition of CyberOptics Corporation (“CyberOptics”) pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 7, 2022, by and among the Company, Meta Merger Company and CyberOptics. CyberOptics is a leading global developer and manufacturer of high-precision 3D optical sensing technology solutions. The CyberOptics acquisition expanded our test and inspection platform, providing differentiated technology that expands our product offering in the semiconductor and electronics industries and will be reported in our Advanced Technology Solutions segment. The all-cash transaction of approximately $\n380,000\n, net of cash acquired, was funded using our revolving credit facility and is not expected to have a material impact on our Consolidated Financial Statements.\nNordson Corporation 61\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nThe management of Nordson Corporation is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting.\nUsing criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework), Nordson’s management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022.\nBased on our assessment, management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of October 31, 2022.\nThe independent registered public accounting firm, Ernst & Young LLP, has also audited the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022. Their report is included herein.\nNordson Corporation 62\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited Nordson Corporation’s internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Nordson Corporation (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of October 31, 2022, based on the COSO criteria.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of October 31, 2022 and 2021, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended October 31, 2022, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) and our report dated December 19, 2022 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.\nOur audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Ernst & Young LLP\nCleveland, Ohio\nDecember 19, 2022\nNordson Corporation 63\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareholders and the Board of Directors of Nordson Corporation\nOpinion on the Financial Statements\nWe have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Nordson Corporation (the Company) as of\nOctober 31, 2022\nand\n2021\n, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, shareholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nOctober 31, 2022\n, and the related notes and financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a) (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at\nOctober 31, 2022\nand\n2021\n, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended\nOctober 31, 2022\n, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.\nWe also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of\nOctober 31, 2022\n, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated\nDecember 19, 2022\nexpressed an unqualified opinion thereon.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company’s management.
