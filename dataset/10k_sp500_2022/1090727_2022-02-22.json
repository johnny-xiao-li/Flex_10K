    "text": "Overview\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc. (“UPS”), founded in 1907, is the world’s premier package delivery company and a leading provider of global supply chain management solutions. We offer a broad range of industry-leading products and services through our extensive presence in North America; Europe; the Indian sub-continent, Middle East and Africa (“ISMEA”); Asia Pacific and Latin America. Our services include transportation and delivery, distribution, contract logistics, ocean freight, air freight, customs brokerage and insurance.\nWe operate one of the largest airlines and one of the largest fleets of alternative fuel vehicles under a global UPS brand. We deliver packages each business day for approximately 1.7 million shipping customers to 11.8 million delivery customers in over 220 countries and territories. In 2021, we delivered an average of 25.2 million packages per day, totaling 6.4 billion packages during the year. Total revenue in 2021 was $97.3 billion.\nStrategy\nOur well-defined strategy focuses on growing in the parts of the market that value our end-to-end network, including business-to-business (\"B2B\"), healthcare, small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") and large enterprise accounts. We are on a journey to execute our\nCustomer First, People Led, Innovation Driven\nstrategy as we transform our business.\nCustomer First\nis about reducing the friction of doing business. We help our customers seize new opportunities, compete, and succeed by delivering the capabilities that they tell us matter the most: speed and ease.\nPeople Led\nspecifically focuses on how likely an employee is to recommend UPS employment to a friend or family member. We know successful outcomes are built from a strong culture, so we are striving to make UPS a great place to work. Through our transformation initiatives, we are creating fewer but more impactful jobs. We are also enhancing the employee value proposition to align with evolving market practices.\nInnovation Driven\nis designed to optimize the volume that flows through our network, to focus on increasing value share and driving business growth from higher-yielding opportunities in our target markets. We are using technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network. In our United States (\" U.S.\") Domestic Package segment, our aim is to improve revenue mix and lower our cost to serve. Within the International Package segment and Supply Chain Solutions businesses, we are focused on value share gains and growing operating profit.\n1\nCompetitive Strengths\nOur competitive strengths include:\nGlobal Smart Logistics Network.\nWe believe that our integrated global air and ground network is the most extensive in the industry. We provide all types of package services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) through a single pickup and delivery network. Our sophisticated engineering systems allow us to optimize network efficiency and asset utilization.\nGlobal Presence.\nWe serve more than 220 countries and territories. We have a significant presence in all of the world’s major economies, allowing us to effectively and efficiently operate around the world.\nCutting-Edge Technologies.\nWe are a global leader in developing technologies that help our customers enhance their shipping and logistics business processes to lower costs, improve service and increase efficiency. We offer a variety of online tools that enable our customers to integrate UPS functionality into their own websites, deepening our customer relationships. These tools allow customers to send, manage and track their shipments, and also to provide their customers with better information services.\nA Broad Portfolio of Services.\nOur portfolio of services helps customers choose their most appropriate delivery option. Increasingly, our customers benefit from UPS business solutions that integrate our services beyond package delivery. For example, supply chain services – such as freight forwarding, truckload brokerage, customs brokerage, order fulfillment and returns management – help improve the efficiency of our customers’ entire supply chain management process.\nCustomer Relationships.\nWe focus on building and maintaining long-term customer relationships. Providing value-added services beyond package delivery, and cross-selling small package and supply chain services across our customer base, are important retention tools and growth mechanisms for us.\nBrand Equity.\nWe have built a leading and trusted brand that stands for quality, reliability and service innovation. Our vehicles and the professional courtesy of our drivers are major contributors to our brand equity.\nDistinctive Culture.\nWe believe that the dedication of our employees comes in large part from our distinctive “employee-owner” culture. Our founders believed that employee stock ownership was a vital foundation for successful business, and the employee stock ownership tradition dates back to our first stock ownership program in 1927. Our legacy of fairness and equity is the bedrock of our culture and of our relationships with those we serve.\nFinancial Strength.\nOur financial strength allows us to generate value for our shareowners by investing in technology, transportation equipment, facilities and employee development; pursuing strategic opportunities that facilitate our growth and maintaining a strong credit rating that gives us flexibility in running the business.\nProducts and Services; Reporting Segments\nWe have two reporting segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. U.S. Domestic Package and International Package are together referred to as our global small package operations.\nGlobal Small Package\nOur global small package operations provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. These services are supported by numerous shipping, visibility and billing technologies. For example, our Digital Access Program makes it easier for SMBs to use our services by embedding our shipping solutions directly into leading e-commerce platforms.\nAll services (air, ground, domestic, international, commercial and residential) are managed through a single, global smart logistics network. We combine all packages within our network, unless dictated by specific service commitments. This enables us to efficiently pick up customers’ shipments for any services at a scheduled time each day. Our integrated network provides unique operational and capital efficiencies that have a lower environmental impact than single service network designs.\n2\nWe offer same-day pickup of air and ground packages seven days a week. Our global network offers approximately 188,000 entry points where customers can tender packages to us at locations and times convenient to them. This includes UPS drivers who can accept packages, UPS drop boxes, UPS Access Point locations, The UPS Store locations, authorized shipping outlets and commercial counters, alliance locations and customer centers attached to UPS facilities. Our UPS Access Point network includes local small businesses and national retailers. This network allows consumers to ship or redirect packages to an alternate delivery location or to drop off pre-labeled packages, including returns. The UPS Access Point network includes more than 20,000 locations within the U.S. and 52,000 globally.\nWe offer a portfolio of returns services in more than 140 countries. These services are driven by the continued growth of e-commerce that has increased our customers’ need for efficient and reliable returns, and are designed to promote efficiency and a friction-free consumer experience. This portfolio provides a range of cost-effective label and digital returns options and a broad network of consumer drop points. We also offer a selection of returns technologies, such as UPS Returns Manager, that promote systems integration, increase customer ease of use and visibility of inbound merchandise. These technologies help reduce costs and improve efficiency in our customers' reverse logistics processes.\nOur global air operations are based in Louisville, Kentucky, and are supported by air hubs across the United States and internationally. We operate international air hubs in Germany, China, Hong Kong, Canada and Florida (for Latin America and the Caribbean). This network design enables cost-effective package processing in our most technology-enabled facilities, which allows us to use fewer, larger and more fuel-efficient aircraft.\nU.S. Domestic Package\nWe are a leader in time-definite, guaranteed small package delivery services in the United States. We offer a full spectrum of U.S. domestic guaranteed air and ground package transportation services. Our U.S. ground fleet serves all business and residential zip codes in the contiguous United States.\n•\nOur air portfolio offers time-definite, same day, next day, two day and three day delivery alternatives.\n•\nOur ground network enables customers to ship using our day-definite guaranteed ground service. We deliver more ground packages in the U.S. than any other carrier, with average daily package volume of more than 17 million, most within one to three business days.\n•\nUPS SurePost provides residential ground service for customers with non-urgent, lightweight residential shipments. It offers the consistency and reliability of the UPS ground network, with final delivery often provided by the U.S. Postal Service.\nInternational Package\nInternational Package consists of our small package operations in Europe, Asia Pacific, Canada, Latin America and ISMEA. International high-growth markets are one of our identified growth opportunities. We offer a wide selection of guaranteed day- and time-definite international shipping services, including more guaranteed time-definite express options than any other carrier.\nFor international package shipments that do not require express services, UPS Worldwide Expedited offers a reliable, deferred, guaranteed day-definite service option. For cross-border ground package delivery, we offer UPS Standard delivery services within Europe, between the U.S. and Canada, and between the U.S. and Mexico. UPS Worldwide Express Freight is a premium international service for urgent, palletized shipments over 150 pounds.\nEurope is our largest region outside of the U.S. and, in 2021, accounted for nearly half of our international package segment revenue. We continue to make major European infrastructure investments to meet growing demand for our services and to improve transit times across the region. Customers can reach more than 80% of Europe's population within two business days using UPS Standard.\nWe serve more than 40 Asia Pacific countries and territories through more than two dozen alliances with local delivery companies that supplement our owned operations.\nThe introduction of a direct flight from the U.S. to Dubai has improved time-in-transit to key destinations in ISMEA for shippers throughout the U.S., Canada and Latin America. In India, we are investing in our network to improve transit times and extend pickup times, allowing businesses to gain faster access to markets in Europe and the United States.\n3\nSupply Chain Solutions\nSupply Chain Solutions consists of our forwarding, truckload brokerage, logistics and distribution, Roadie, UPS Capital and other businesses. Supply chain complexity creates demand for a global service offering that incorporates transportation, distribution and international trade and brokerage services, with complementary financial and information services. Many companies see value in outsourcing non-core logistics activity. With increased competition and growth opportunities in new markets, businesses require flexible and responsive supply chains to support their strategies. We meet this demand by offering a broad array of supply chain services in more than 200 countries and territories.\nThe divestiture of UPS Freight was completed on April 30, 2021. As a result of the divestiture, we renamed Supply Chain & Freight as Supply Chain Solutions. For additional information on the divestiture, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nForwarding\nWe are one of the largest U.S. domestic air freight carriers and among the top air freight forwarders globally. We offer a portfolio of guaranteed and non-guaranteed global air freight services. Additionally, as one of the world’s leading non-vessel operating common carriers, we provide ocean freight full-container load, less-than-container load and multimodal transportation services between most major ports around the world.\nTruckload Brokerage\nWe provide truckload brokerage services in the U.S. and Europe through our Coyote-branded subsidiaries. Access to the UPS fleet, combined with a broad third-party carrier network, creates customized capacity solutions for all markets and customers. Coyote customers can also access UPS services such as air freight, customs brokerage and global freight forwarding.\nLogistics & Distribution\nOur Logistics & Distribution business provides value-added fulfillment and transportation management services. We leverage a network of more than 1,000 facilities in over 120 countries to ensure products and parts are in the right place at the right time. We operate both multi-client and dedicated facilities across our network, many of which are strategically located near UPS air and ground transportation hubs to support rapid delivery to consumer and business markets.\nHealthcare logistics is one of our targeted areas for growth. We offer world-class technology, deep expertise and the most sophisticated suite of services in the industry. With a strategic focus on serving the unique, priority-handling needs of healthcare and life sciences customers, we have increased our cold-chain logistics capabilities to support the rapid deployment of COVID-19 vaccines both in the U.S. and internationally and we have delivered over one billion doses of COVID-19 vaccines.\nCustoms Brokerage\nWe are among the world’s largest customs brokers, as measured by both the number of shipments processed annually and by the number of dedicated brokerage employees worldwide. In addition to customs clearance services, we provide product classification, trade management, duty drawback and consulting services.\nRoadie\nOn October 1, 2021, we acquired Roadie, a technology platform that enables local same-day delivery with operations throughout the United States. The Roadie technology platform is purpose-built to connect merchants and consumers with contract drivers to enable efficient and scalable same-day local delivery services, including items that are not compatible with the UPS network.\nUPS Capital\nUPS Capital offers integrated supply chain insurance solutions for in-transit goods to both small and large businesses. UPS Capital also offers insured transportation of high value goods.\n4\nHuman Capital\nOur success is dependent upon our people, working together with a common purpose. We have approximately 534,000 employees (excluding temporary seasonal employees), of which 444,000 are in the U.S. and 90,000 are located internationally. Our global workforce includes approximately 89,000 management employees (44% of whom are part-time) and 445,000 hourly employees (51% of whom are part-time). More than 70% of our U.S. employees are represented by unions, primarily those employees handling or transporting packages. In addition, approximately 3,100 of our pilots are represented by the Independent Pilots Association.\nWe believe that UPS employees are among the most motivated, highest-performing people in the industry and provide us with a meaningful competitive advantage. To assist with employee recruitment and retention, we continue to review the competitiveness of our employee value proposition, including benefits and pay, the range of continuous training, talent development and promotional opportunities. For additional information on the importance of our human capital efforts, see \"Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Failure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us\".\nOversight and management\nWe believe in creating an inclusive and equitable environment that represents a broad spectrum of backgrounds, cultures and stakeholders. By leveraging diversity with respect to gender, age, ethnicity, skills and other factors, and creating inclusive environments, we believe we can improve organizational effectiveness, cultivate innovation and drive growth.\nOur Board of Directors and Board committees provide oversight on human capital matters through a variety of methods and processes. These include regular updates and discussion around human capital transformation efforts, technology initiatives impacting the workforce, health and safety matters, employee survey results related to culture and other matters, hiring and retention, employee demographics, labor relations and contract negotiations, compensation and benefits, succession planning and employee training initiatives. We believe the Board’s oversight of these matters helps identify and mitigate exposure to labor and human capital management risks, and is part of the broader framework that guides how we attract, retain and develop a workforce that aligns with our values and strategies.\nTransformation\nAs we expand and enter new markets, and seek to capture new opportunities and pursue growth, we need employees to grow and innovate along with us. We believe that transforming the UPS employee experience is foundational to our success. This requires a thoughtful balance between the culture we have cultivated over the years and new approaches to lead our business into the future.\nWe are investing in capabilities that will transform our business, including investments in employee opportunities to support growth. We provide training for management employees on professionalism and performance as well as unconscious bias and diversity and inclusion to ensure our actions match our values.\nAdditional information on our human capital efforts is contained in our annual sustainability report, which describes our activities that support our commitment to acting responsibly and contributing to society. This report is available under the heading \"Social Impact\" at\nwww.about.ups.com\n.\nCollective bargaining\nWe bargain in good faith with the unions that represent our employees. We frequently engage union leaders at the national level and at local chapters throughout the United States. We participate in works councils and associations outside the U.S., which allows us to respond to emerging regional issues. This work helps our operations to build and maintain productive relationships with our employees. For additional information regarding employees employed under collective bargaining agreements, see note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n5\nEmployee health and safety\nWe are committed to industry-leading employee health, safety and wellness programs across our growing workforce. We develop a culture of health and safety by:\n•\ninvesting in safety training and audits;\n•\npromoting wellness practices which mitigate risk; and\n•\noffering benefits designed to keep employees safe in the workplace and beyond.\nOur local health and safety committees coach employees on UPS’s safety processes and are able to share best practices across work groups. Our safety methods and procedures are increasingly focused on the variables associated with residential delivery environments, which have become more common with the growth in e-commerce. We monitor our performance in this area through various measurable targets including lost time injury frequency and the number of recorded auto accidents.\nCustomers\nBuilding and maintaining long-term customer relationships is a competitive strength of UPS. In 2021, we served 1.7 million shipping customers and more than 11.8 million delivery customers daily. For the year ended December 31, 2021, one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, represented approximately 11.7% of our consolidated revenues, substantially all of which was within our U.S. Domestic Package segment. For additional information on our customers, see “Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Changes in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us” and note 15 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nCompetition\nWe offer a broad array of transportation and logistics services and compete with many local, regional, national and international logistics providers as well as national postal services. We believe our strategy, network and competitive strengths position us well to compete in the marketplace. For additional information on our competitive environment, see \"Risk Factors - Business and Operating Risks - Our industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us\".\nGovernment Regulation\nWe are subject to numerous laws and regulations in the countries in which we operate. Continued compliance with increasingly stringent laws, regulations and policies in the U.S. and in the other countries in which we operate may result in materially increased costs, or we could be subject to substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations.\nAir Operations\nThe U.S. Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Federal Aviation Administration (“FAA”) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, through the Transportation Security Administration (“TSA”), have primary regulatory authority over our air transportation services.\nThe DOT’s authority primarily relates to economic aspects of air transportation, such as operating authority, insurance requirements, pricing, non-competitive practices, interlocking relations and cooperative agreements. The DOT also regulates international routes, fares, rates and practices and is authorized to investigate and take action against discriminatory treatment of U.S. air carriers abroad. International operating rights for U.S. airlines are usually subject to bilateral agreements between the U.S. and foreign governments or, in the absence of such agreements, by principles of reciprocity. We are also subject to current and potential aviation, health, customs and immigration regulations imposed by governments in other countries in which we operate, including registration and license requirements and security regulations. We have international route operating rights granted by the DOT and we may apply for additional authorities when those operating rights are available and are required for the efficient operation of our international network. The efficiency and flexibility of our international air transportation network is subject to DOT and foreign government regulations and operating restrictions.\nThe FAA’s authority primarily relates to operational, technical and safety aspects of air transportation, including certification, aircraft operating procedures, transportation of hazardous materials, record keeping standards and maintenance activities and personnel. In addition, we are subject to non-U.S. government regulation of aviation rights involving non-U.S. jurisdictions and non-U.S. customs regulation.\n6\nUPS's aircraft maintenance programs and procedures, including aircraft inspection and repair at periodic intervals, are approved for all aircraft under FAA regulations. The future cost of repairs pursuant to these programs may fluctuate according to aircraft condition, age and the enactment of additional FAA regulatory requirements.\nThe TSA regulates various security aspects of air cargo transportation. Our airport and off-airport locations, as well as our personnel, facilities and procedures involved in air cargo transportation must comply with TSA regulations.\nWe participate in the Civil Reserve Air Fleet (“CRAF”) program. Our participation in this program allows the U.S. Department of Defense (“DOD”) to requisition specified UPS aircraft for military use during a national defense emergency. The DOD is required to compensate us for any use of aircraft under the CRAF program. In addition, participation in the CRAF program entitles us to bid for other U.S. Government opportunities including small package and air freight.\nGround Operations\nOur ground transportation of packages in the U.S. is subject to regulation by the DOT and its agency, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (the “FMCSA”). Ground transportation also falls under state jurisdiction with respect to the regulation of operations, safety and insurance. Our ground transportation of hazardous materials in the U.S. is subject to regulation by the DOT's Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration. We also must comply with safety and fitness regulations promulgated by the FMCSA, including those relating to drug and alcohol testing and hours of service for drivers. Ground transportation of packages outside of the U.S. is subject to similar regulatory schemes in the countries in which we transport those packages.\nThe Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 created the U.S. Postal Service as an independent establishment of the executive branch of the federal government, and created the Postal Rate Commission, an independent agency, to recommend postal rates. The Postal Accountability and Enhancement Act of 2006 amended the 1970 Act to give the re-named Postal Regulatory Commission revised oversight authority over many aspects of the U.S. Postal Service, including postal rates, product offerings and service standards. We sometimes participate in proceedings before the Postal Regulatory Commission in an attempt to secure fair postal rates for competitive services.\nOur ground operations are also subject to compliance with various cargo-security and transportation regulations issued by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, including regulation by the TSA in the U.S., and similar regulations issued by foreign governments in other countries.\nCustoms\nWe are subject to the customs laws regarding the import and export of shipments in the countries in which we operate, including those related to the filing of documents on behalf of client importers and exporters. Our activities in the U.S., including customs brokerage and freight forwarding, are subject to regulation by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection, the TSA, the U.S. Federal Maritime Commission and the DOT. Our international operations are subject to similar regulatory structures in their respective jurisdictions.\nFor additional information, see “Risk Factors – Business and Operating    Risks – Increased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach, which could materially adversely affect us”.\nEnvironmental\nWe are subject to federal, state and local environmental laws and regulations across all of our operations. These laws and regulations cover a variety of processes, including, but not limited to: properly storing, handling and disposing of waste materials; appropriately managing waste water and storm water; monitoring and maintaining the integrity of underground storage tanks; complying with laws regarding clean air, including those governing emissions; protecting against and appropriately responding to spills and releases and communicating the presence of reportable quantities of hazardous materials to local responders. We maintain site- and activity-specific environmental compliance and pollution prevention programs to address our environmental responsibilities and remain compliant. In addition, we maintain numerous programs which seek to minimize waste and prevent pollution within our operations.\nPursuant to the Federal Aviation Act, the FAA, with the assistance of the Environmental Protection Agency is authorized to establish standards governing aircraft noise. Our aircraft fleet complies with current noise standards of the federal aviation regulations. Our international operations are also subject to noise regulations in certain other countries in which we operate.\nFor additional information, see “Risk Factors – Regulatory and Legal Risks – Increasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs”.\n7\nCommunications and Data Protection\nBecause of our use of radio and other communication facilities in our operations, we are subject to the Federal Communications Act of 1934, as amended. In addition, the Federal Communications Commission regulates and licenses our activities pertaining to satellite communications. There has recently been increased regulatory and enforcement focus on data protection in the U.S. (at both the state and federal level) and in other countries.\nFor additional information, see “Risk Factors – Business and Operating Risks – A significant data breach or information technology system disruption could materially adversely affect us”.\nHealth and Safety\nWe are subject to numerous federal, state and local laws and regulations governing employee health and safety, both in the U.S and in other countries.\nCompliance with changing laws and regulations from time to time, including those promulgated by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration, could result in materially increased operating costs and capital expenditures, and negatively impact our ability to attract and retain employees.\nFor additional information on governmental regulations and their potential impact on us generally, see “Risk Factors – Regulatory and Legal Risks”.\nWhere You Can Find More Information\nWe maintain websites for business and customer matters at\nwww.ups.com\n,\nand for investor relations matters at\nwww.investors.ups.com\n.

    "text": "Our business, financial condition and results of operations are and will remain subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. You should carefully consider the following risk factors, which may have materially affected or could materially affect us, including impacting our business, financial condition, results of operations, stock price, credit rating or reputation. You should read these risk factors in conjunction with \"Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\" in Item 7 and our \"Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\" in Item 8. These are not the only risks we face. We could also be affected by other unknown events, factors, uncertainties, or risks that we do not currently consider to be material.\nBusiness and Operating Risks\nThe outbreak and spread of the coronavirus COVID-19 has had a significant impact on us, as well as on the operations, financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers. We are unable to predict the full extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic, or variations thereof, will continue to impact us.\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has had a substantial impact on business and consumer activity, including a curtailment of business activities (including a decrease in demand for a broad variety of goods and services), and resulted in weakened economic conditions, significant supply chain disruptions, ongoing economic uncertainty and volatility in global financial markets. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have significantly impacted, and may continue to significantly impact us, and have had, and may continue to have, a material adverse impact on the operations, financial performance and liquidity of many of our customers.\nBecause the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and its consequences remain uncertain, are changing and difficult to predict, the future impact on our operations, financial condition and liquidity also remains uncertain and difficult to predict. The impact of the pandemic will continue to depend on evolving factors, many of which are not within our control, and to which we may not be able to effectively respond. These risks include, but are not limited to: a significant reduction in revenue due to renewed or extended curtailment of business activities; a significant increase in our expenses or a reduction in our operating margins due to long-term changes in the mix of our products and services; effects from governmental, business and individuals’ actions that have been and continue to be taken in response to the pandemic (including restrictions on travel and transportation and workforce pressures); reductions in operating effectiveness due to employees working remotely; unavailability of personnel; the delay or cancellation of capital projects and related delays in, or loss of, expected benefits therefrom; limited access to liquidity; increased volatility and pricing in the capital and commercial paper markets; further disruption of global supply chains; impairments in the fair value of our assets; increases in pension funding obligations; and reductions in our customers’ credit-worthiness. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the volatile regional and global economic conditions stemming from it, could also precipitate or aggravate risk factors that we identify herein or affect our operations and financial performance in a manner that is not presently known to us or that we currently do not consider material. The occurrence or continuation of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in general economic conditions, in the U.S. and internationally, may adversely affect us.\nWe conduct operations in over 220 countries and territories. Our operations are subject to cyclicality affecting national and international economies in general, as well as the local economic environments in which we operate. Changes in general economic conditions are beyond our control, and it may be difficult for us to adjust our business model to mitigate the impact of these factors. For example, we are affected by levels of industrial production, inflation, consumer spending and retail activity. We could be materially affected by adverse developments in these aspects of the economy, including without limitation the impact of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have also been, and may in the future be adversely impacted by, changes in economic conditions as a result of geopolitical uncertainty and/or conflicts in the countries and/or regions where we operate, including the United Kingdom, the European Union, the Ukraine, the Russian Federation and the Trans-Pacific region. Changes in general economic conditions, or our inability to accurately forecast these changes or mitigate the impact of these conditions on our business, could materially adversely affect us.\n9\nOur industry is rapidly evolving. We expect to continue to face significant competition, which could materially adversely affect us.\nOur industry is rapidly evolving, including demands for faster deliveries and increased visibility into shipments. We expect to continue to face significant competition on a local, regional, national and international basis. Competitors include the U. S. and other international postal services, various motor carriers, express companies, freight forwarders, air couriers, large transportation and e-commerce companies that have made and continue to make significant investments in their own logistics capabilities, some of whom are currently our customers. We also face competition from start ups and other smaller companies that combine technologies with crowdsourcing to focus on local market needs. Competition may also come from other sources in the future as new technologies are developed. Competitors have cost, operational and organizational structures that differ from ours and may offer services or pricing terms that we are not willing or able to offer. Additionally, to sustain the level of service and value that we deliver to our customers, from time to time we may raise prices and our customers may not be willing to accept these higher prices. If we do not timely and appropriately respond to competitive pressures, including replacing any lost volume or maintaining our profitability, we could be materially adversely affected.\nContinued transportation market growth may further increase competition. As a result, competitors may improve their financial capacity and strengthen their competitive positions. Business combinations could also result in competitors providing a wider variety of services and products at competitive prices, which could materially adversely affect us.\nChanges in our relationships with any of our significant customers, including the loss or reduction in business from one or more of them, could have a material adverse effect on us.\nFor the year ended December 31, 2021, business from one customer, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates, accounted for 11.7% of our consolidated revenues. Some of our other significant customers can account for a relatively significant portion of our revenues in a particular quarter or year. Customer impact on our revenue is based on factors such as: pricing terms; product launches; e-commerce or other industry trends, including those related to the holiday season; business combinations and the overall growth of a customer's underlying business; as well as any disruptions to their businesses. Customers could choose, and have in the past chosen\n,\nto divert all or a portion of their business with us to one of our competitors, demand pricing concessions for our services, require us to provide enhanced services that increase our costs, or develop their own logistics capabilities. In addition, certain of our significant customer contracts include termination rights of either party upon the occurrence of certain events or without cause upon advance notice to the other party. If all or a portion of our business relationships with one or more significant customers were to terminate or significantly change, this could materially adversely affect us.\nFailure to attract or retain qualified employees could materially adversely affect us.\nWe maintain a large workforce. We necessarily depend on the skills and continued service of our employees, including our executive leadership team. We also regularly hire a large number of part-time and seasonal workers. We must attract, engage, develop and retain a large and diverse global workforce, while controlling labor costs and maintaining an environment that supports our core values. Our ability to control labor costs is subject to numerous factors, including turnover, training costs, regulatory changes, market pressures, inflation, unemployment levels and healthcare and other benefit costs. If we are unable to hire, properly train and retain qualified employees, we could experience higher labor costs, reduced revenues, further increased workers' compensation and automobile liability claims, regulatory noncompliance, customer losses and diminution of our brand value or company culture, which could materially adversely affect us.\nIn addition, our strategic initiatives, including transformation, have led and are expected to continue to lead to the creation of fewer, but more impactful, jobs as we strive to lower our cost to serve. Our inability to continue to retain experienced and motivated employees may also materially adversely affect us.\nIncreased security requirements impose substantial costs on us and we could be the target of an attack or have a security breach, which could materially adversely affect us.\nAs a result of concerns about global terrorism and homeland security, various governments have adopted and may continue to adopt stricter security requirements resulting in increased operating costs in the transportation industry. Regulatory and legislative requirements may change periodically in response to evolving threats. We cannot determine the effect that any new requirements will have on our operations, cost structure or operating results, and new rules or other future security requirements may increase our operating costs and reduce operating efficiencies. Regardless of our compliance with security requirements or the steps we take to secure our facilities or fleet, we could also be the target of an attack or security breaches could occur, which could materially adversely affect us.\n10\nStrikes, work stoppages and slowdowns by our employees could materially adversely affect us.\nMany of our U.S. employees are employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (\"the Teamsters\"). Our airline pilots, airline mechanics, ground mechanics and certain other employees are employed under other collective bargaining agreements. In addition, some of our international employees are employed under collective bargaining or similar agreements. Strikes, work stoppages or slowdowns by our employees could adversely affect our ability to meet our customers' needs. As a result, customers may reduce their business or stop doing business with us if they believe that such actions or threatened actions may adversely affect our ability to provide services. We may permanently lose customers if we are unable to provide uninterrupted service, and this could materially adversely affect us. The terms of future collective bargaining agreements also may affect our competitive position and results of operations.\nFailure to maintain our brand image and corporate reputation could materially adversely affect us.\nOur success depends in part on our ability to maintain the image of the UPS brand and our reputation. Service quality issues, actual or perceived, could tarnish the image of our brand and may cause customers not to use UPS services. Also, adverse publicity or public sentiment surrounding labor relations, environmental and sustainability concerns, security matters, political activities and similar matters, or attempts to connect our company to such issues, either in the U.S. or other countries in which we operate, could negatively affect our overall reputation and demand for our services. Damage to our reputation and loss of brand equity could have a material adverse effect on us, and could require additional resources to rebuild our reputation and restore the value of our brand.\nA significant data breach or information technology system disruption could materially adversely affect us.\nWe rely on information technology networks and systems, including the internet and a number of internally-developed systems and applications. For example, we rely on information technology to receive package level information in advance of the physical receipt of packages, to move and track packages through our operations, to efficiently plan deliveries, to execute billing processes, and to track and report financial and operational data. Our franchise locations and subsidiaries also rely on information technology systems to manage their business processes and activities.\nIn addition, our services, and the operation of our networks and systems involve the collection, storage and transmission of significant amounts of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personal information of customers, employees and others. We regularly move data across national borders, and are subject to a variety of evolving laws and regulations in the U.S. and abroad regarding privacy, data protection and data security. The scope of the laws that may be applicable to us is often uncertain and may be conflicting, particularly with respect to foreign laws. For example, the E.U.'s General Data Protection Regulation greatly increases the jurisdictional reach of, and potential penalties under, E.U. law, and adds a broad array of requirements for handling personal data, including the public disclosure of significant data breaches. Other countries have also enacted or are enacting data localization laws that require data to stay within their borders. These evolving requirements impose significant costs that are likely to increase over time.\nInformation technology systems (ours, as well as those of our franchisees, acquired businesses, and third-party service providers) are susceptible to damage, disruptions or shutdowns due to programming errors, defects or other vulnerabilities, power outages, hardware failures, computer viruses, cyber-attacks, ransomware attacks, malware attacks, theft, misconduct by employees or other insiders, telecommunications failures, misuse, human errors or other catastrophic events. These events may, from time to time, cause service outages, allow inappropriate or block legitimate access to systems or information, or result in other interruptions in our business. In addition, breaches in security expose us, our customers and franchisees, or the individuals affected, to a risk of loss, disclosure or misuse of proprietary information and sensitive or confidential data, including personally identifiable information. The techniques used to obtain unauthorized access, disable or degrade service or sabotage systems change frequently, may be difficult to detect and often are not recognized until launched against a target. As a result, we may be unable to anticipate these techniques or to implement adequate measures to prevent any of the events described above.\n11\nWe also depend on and interact with the information technology networks and systems of third-parties for many aspects of our business operations, including our customers, franchisees and service providers such as cloud service providers and third-party delivery services. These third parties may have access to information we maintain about our company, operations, customers, employees and vendors, or operating systems that are critical to or can significantly impact our business operations. These third parties are subject to risks imposed by data breaches and information technology systems disruptions like those described above, and other events or actions that could damage, disrupt or close down their networks or systems. Security processes, protocols and standards that we implement and contractual provisions requiring security measures that we impose on such third-parties may not be sufficient or effective at preventing such events. These events could result in unauthorized access to, or disruptions or denials of access to, misuse or disclosure of, information or systems that are important to us, including proprietary information, sensitive or confidential data, and other information about our operations, customers, employees and suppliers, including personal information.\nAny of these events that impact our information technology networks or systems, franchisees, customers, service providers or other third-parties, could result in material disruptions in our business, the loss of existing or potential customers, damage to our brand and reputation, regulatory scrutiny, litigation and other potential liability. In addition, our customers’ confidence in our ability to protect data and systems and to provide services consistent with their expectations could be impacted, further disrupting our operations. Similarly, an actual or alleged failure to comply with applicable U.S. or foreign data protection regulations or other data protection standards may expose us to litigation, fines, sanctions or other penalties.\nWe have invested and expect to continue to invest in technology security initiatives, information technology risk management and disaster recovery plans. The cost and operational consequences of implementing, maintaining and enhancing further data or system protection measures could increase significantly to overcome increasingly frequent, complex and sophisticated cyber threats. Despite our best efforts, we are at risk from data breaches and system disruptions. Although to date we are unaware of any material data breach or system disruption, including a cyber-attack, we cannot provide any assurances that such events and impacts will not be material in the future.\nOur efforts to deter, identify, mitigate and/or eliminate future breaches may require significant additional effort and expense and may not be successful.\nGlobal climate change presents challenges to our business which could materially adversely affect us.\nThe effects of climate change create financial and operational risks to our business, both directly and indirectly. We have made several public statements regarding our intended reduction of carbon emissions, including our most recent goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 and our other short- and mid-term environmental sustainability goals. We may be required to expend significant additional resources to acquire assets or on remediation efforts to meet these goals, which could significantly increase our operational costs. We could also be required to write down the carrying value of assets, which could result in impairment charges.\nFurther, there can be no assurance of the extent to which any of our goals will be achieved, or that any future investments we make will meet investor expectations or any legal standards regarding sustainability performance. In particular, our ability to meet our goals depends in part on significant technological advancements with respect to the development and availability of reliable, affordable and sustainable alternative solutions, including aviation fuel and alternative fuel vehicles. Moreover, we may determine that it is in our best interests to prioritize other business, social, governance or sustainable investments over the achievement of our current goals based on economic, regulatory or social factors, business strategy or other factors. If we do not meet these goals, then, in addition to regulatory and legal risks related to compliance, we could incur adverse publicity and reaction, which could adversely impact our reputation, and in turn adversely impact our results of operations. While we remain committed to being responsive to climate change and reducing our carbon footprint, there can be no assurance that our goals and strategic plans to achieve those goals will be successful, that the costs related to climate transition will not be higher than expected, that the necessary technological advancements will occur in the timeframe we expect, or at all, or that proposed regulation or deregulation related to climate change will not have a negative competitive impact, any one of which could have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures, operating margins and results of operations.\nSevere weather or other natural or man-made disasters could materially adversely affect us.\nSevere weather conditions or other natural or man-made disasters, including storms, floods, fires, earthquakes, epidemics, pandemics, conflicts, unrest, or terrorist attacks, have in the past and may in the future disrupt our business. Customers may reduce shipments, or our costs to operate our business may increase, either of which could have a material adverse effect on us. Any such event affecting one of our major facilities could result in a significant interruption in or disruption of our business.\n12\nEconomic, political, or social developments and other risks associated with international operations could materially adversely affect us.\nWe have significant international operations. We are exposed to changing economic, political and social developments that are beyond our control. Emerging markets are typically more volatile than those in other countries, and any broad-based downturn in these markets could reduce our revenues and materially adversely affect our business, financial condition and results of operations. We are subject to many laws governing our international operations, including those that prohibit improper payments to government officials and commercial customers, govern our environmental impact or labor matters, and restrict where we can do business, our shipments to certain countries and the information that we can provide to non-U.S. governments. Our failure to manage and anticipate these and other risks associated with our international operations could materially adversely affect us.\nOur inability to effectively integrate any acquired operations and realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisitions, joint ventures, strategic alliances or dispositions could materially adversely affect us.\nFrom time to time we acquire businesses, form joint ventures and strategic alliances, and dispose of operations. Whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these transactions will depend, in part, upon the successful integration between the businesses involved, the performance of the underlying operations, capabilities or technologies and the management of the acquired operations. Accordingly, our financial results could be materially adversely affected by our failure to effectively integrate acquired operations, unanticipated performance issues or transaction-related charges.\nFinancial Risks\nWe are exposed to the effects of changing fuel and energy prices, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel, and interruptions in supplies of these commodities.\nChanging fuel and energy costs have a significant impact on our operations. We require significant quantities of fuel for our aircraft and delivery vehicles and are exposed to the risks associated with variations in the market price for petroleum products, including gasoline, diesel and jet fuel. We seek to mitigate our exposure to changing fuel prices through fuel surcharges and utilizing hedging transactions from time to time. If we are unable to maintain or increase our fuel surcharges, higher fuel costs could materially adversely impact our operating results. Even if we are able to offset changes in fuel costs with surcharges, high fuel surcharges have in the past, and may in the future result in a shift from our higher-yielding products to lower-yielding products or an overall reduction in volume, revenue and profitability. There can also be no assurance that our hedging transactions will be effective. Moreover, we could experience a disruption in energy supplies as a result of war, weather-related events or natural disasters, actions by producers (including as part of their own sustainability efforts) or other factors beyond our control, which could have a material adverse effect on us.\nChanges in exchange rates or interest rates may have a material adverse effect on us.\nWe conduct business in a number of countries, with a significant portion of our revenue derived from operations outside the United States. Our international operations are affected by changes in the exchange rates for local currencies, in particular the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar.\nWe are exposed to changes in interest rates, primarily on our short-term debt and that portion of our long-term debt that carries floating interest rates. Additionally, changes in interest rates impact the valuation of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and the related benefit cost recognized in the statements of consolidated income. The impact of changes in interest rates on our pension and postretirement benefit obligations and costs, and affecting our debt, is discussed further in Part I, \"Item 7 - Critical Accounting Estimates,\" and Part II, “Item 7A - Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk,” respectively, of this report.\nWe monitor and manage currency exchange rates and interest rate exposure, and use derivative instruments to mitigate the impact of changes in these rates on our financial condition and results of operations; however, changes in exchange rates and interest rates cannot always be predicted or effectively hedged, and may have a material adverse effect on us\n.\n13\nOur business requires significant capital and other investments; if we do not accurately forecast our future investment needs, we could be materially adversely affected.\nOur business requires significant capital investments, including in aircraft, vehicles, technology, facilities and sortation and other equipment. In addition to forecasting our capital investment requirements, we adjust other elements of our operations and cost structure in response to economic and regulatory conditions, and consistent with our long-term strategy and commitments. These investments support both our existing business and anticipated growth. Forecasting projected volume involves many factors which are subject to uncertainty, such as general economic trends, changes in governmental regulation and competition. If we do not accurately forecast our future capital investment needs, we could have excess capacity or insufficient capacity, either of which would negatively affect our revenues and profitability.\nEmployee health and retiree health and pension benefit costs represent a significant expense to us; further cost increases could materially adversely affect us.\nOur employee health, retiree health and pension benefit expenses are significant. In recent years, we have experienced significant increases in some of these costs, in particular, ongoing increases in healthcare costs in excess of the rate of inflation and historically low discount rates that we use to value our company-sponsored defined benefit plan obligations. Increasing healthcare costs, volatility in investment returns and discount rates, as well as changes in laws, regulations and assumptions used to calculate retiree health and pension benefit expenses, may materially adversely affect our business, financial condition, or results of operations, and have required, and may in the future require significant contributions to our benefit plans. Our national master agreement with the Teamsters includes provisions that are designed to mitigate certain healthcare expenses, but there can be no assurance that our efforts will be successful or that these efforts will not materially adversely affect us.\nWe participate in various trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period. The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants. Future contribution amounts to multiemployer benefit plans will be determined through collective bargaining. However, in future collective bargaining negotiations, we could agree to make significantly higher future contributions to one or more of these plans. At this time, we are unable to determine the amount of additional future contributions, if any, or whether any material adverse effect on us could result from our participation in these plans.\nIn addition to our ongoing multiemployer pension plan obligations, we may have an obligation in the future to pay significant coordinating benefits previously earned by UPS employees in the Central States Pension Fund (the \"CSPF\"). For additional information on our potential liabilities related to the CSPF, see note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nInsurance and claims expense could materially adversely affect us.\nWe have a combination of both self-insurance and high-deductible insurance programs for the risks arising out of the services we provide and the nature of our global operations, including claims exposure resulting from cargo loss, personal injury, property damage, aircraft and related liabilities, business interruption and workers' compensation. Self-insured workers' compensation, automobile and general liabilities are determined using actuarial estimates of the aggregate liability for claims incurred and an estimate of incurred but not reported claims, on an undiscounted basis. Our accruals for insurance reserves reflect certain actuarial assumptions and management judgments, which are subject to a high degree of variability. If the number or severity of claims for which we are retaining risk continues to increase, which has occurred in recent periods, our financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected. If we lose our ability to self-insure these risks, our insurance cost could materially increase and we may find it difficult to obtain adequate levels of insurance coverage.\nChanges in markets and our business plans have resulted, and may in the future result, in substantial write-downs of the carrying value of our assets, thereby reducing our net income.\nOur regular review of the carrying value of our assets, changes in business strategy, government regulations, including related to climate change, and economic or market conditions have resulted from time to time, and may in the future result, in substantial impairments of our intangible, fixed or other assets. In addition, we have been and may be required in the future to recognize increased depreciation and amortization charges if we determine that the useful lives of our fixed assets or intangible assets are shorter than we originally estimated. Such changes have in the past, and may in the future, reduce our net income.\n14\nWe may have significant additional tax liabilities that could materially adversely affect us.\nWe are subject to income taxes in the U.S. and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain.\nWe are regularly under audit by tax authorities in many jurisdictions. Economic and political pressures to increase tax revenue may make resolving tax disputes more difficult. The final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. In addition, changes in U.S. federal and state or international tax laws, other fundamental law changes currently being considered by many countries, and changes in taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies and positions may materially adversely impact our tax expense and cash flows.\nRegulatory and Legal Risks\nIncreasingly complex and stringent laws, regulations and policies could materially increase our operating costs.\nWe are subject to complex and stringent aviation, transportation, environmental, security, labor, employment, safety, privacy and data protection and other governmental laws, regulations and policies, both in the U.S. and internationally. In addition, we are impacted by laws, regulations and policies that affect global trade, including tariff and trade policies, export requirements, taxes, monetary policies and other restrictions and charges. Trade discussions between the U.S. and various of its trading partners are fluid, and existing and future trade agreements are, and are expected to continue to be, subject to a number of uncertainties, including the imposition of new tariffs or adjustments and changes to the products covered by existing tariffs. The impact of new laws, regulations and policies or decisions or interpretations by authorities applying those laws and regulations, cannot be predicted. Compliance with any new laws, regulations or policies may increase our operating costs or require significant capital expenditures. Any failure to comply with applicable laws, regulations or policies in the U.S. or other countries could result in substantial fines or possible revocation of our authority to conduct our operations, which could materially adversely affect us.\nIncreasingly stringent regulations related to climate change could materially increase our operating costs.\nRegulation of greenhouse gas (\"GHG\")  emissions exposes us to potentially significant new taxes, fees and other costs. Compliance with such regulation, and any increased or additional regulation, or the associated costs is further complicated by the fact that various countries and regions may adopt different approaches to climate change regulation.\nFor example, in 2016, the International Civil Aviation Organization (“ICAO”) adopted the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (“CORSIA”), which is a global, market-based emissions offset program to encourage carbon-neutral growth. A voluntary participation pilot phase began in 2021, and full mandatory participation is scheduled to begin in 2027. ICAO continues to develop details regarding implementation, but compliance with CORSIA will increase our operating costs.\nIn the U.S., Congress has considered but, to date, not passed various bills that would regulate GHG emissions. Nevertheless, we believe some form of federal climate change legislation is possible in the future. Even in the absence of such legislation, the Environmental Protection Agency could determine to regulate GHG emissions, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, and this could impose substantial costs on us.\nIn addition, the impact that the recent re-entry into the Paris climate accord may have on future U.S. policy regarding GHG emissions, on CORSIA and on other GHG regulation remains uncertain. The extent to which other countries implement that accord could also have a material adverse effect on us.\nIncreased regulation relating to GHG emissions in the U.S. or abroad, especially aircraft or diesel engine emissions, could increase the cost of fuel and other energy we purchase and the capital costs associated with updating or replacing our aircraft or vehicles prematurely. We cannot predict the impact any future regulation would have on our cost structure or our operating results. It is likely that such regulation could significantly increase our operating costs and that we may not be willing or able to pass such costs along to our customers. Moreover, even without such regulation, increased awareness and any adverse publicity in the global marketplace about the GHGs emitted by companies in the airline and transportation industries could harm our reputation and reduce customer demand for our services, especially our air services.\n15\nWe may be subject to various claims and lawsuits that could result in significant expenditures which may materially adversely affect us.\nThe nature of our business exposes us to the potential for various claims and litigation related to labor and employment, personal injury, property damage, business practices, environmental liability and other matters. Any material litigation or a catastrophic accident or series of accidents could result in significant expenditures and have a material adverse effect on us."

    "text": "Overview\nWe are on a journey to execute our\nCustomer First, People Led, Innovation Driven\nstrategy within our\nBetter not Bigger\nframework. We are focused on improving revenue quality, reducing our cost to serve, growing operating profit and allocating capital in a disciplined fashion. The\nCustomer First\ncomponent of our strategy focuses on, among other things, enhancing the capabilities that we believe our customers value the most: speed and ease of access to our services. The\nPeople Led\ncomponent of our strategy aims to enhance the employee value proposition. Our\nInnovation Driven\nstrategic approach utilizes technology and automation to deliver sustainable improvements to our network and to enhance the customer experience.\nWe have two reportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. For the year, we increased average daily volume, revenue per piece and operating margin within global small package operations, with growth led by small- and medium-sized businesses (\"SMBs\") as we executed on our strategy. The COVID-19 pandemic continued to have, and is expected to continue to have, an impact on our business. We experienced a year-over-year increase in commercial volume as business returned to pre-pandemic levels, while business-to-consumer volume declined, partly due to the surge in e-commerce at the onset of the pandemic. In the second half of the year, COVID-19 resulted in a reduction in the number of flights we operated in Asia relative to our expectations, which contributed to an overall decline in international volume in the fourth quarter. Within Supply Chain Solutions, operating margin increased with demand for our services particularly strong in Forwarding and healthcare logistics, including COVID-19 relief efforts.\nThe overall economic environment continues to be challenging. Global supply chain disruption continues, and resulted in capacity constraints that drove higher transportation costs, particularly in our Supply Chain Solutions businesses. Rising inflation and labor market challenges continue to cause wage pressures in certain markets. We continue to monitor the impacts of these external conditions on our business; however, we anticipate that demand for our services will remain strong.\nDuring the first quarter of 2021, following enactment of the American Rescue Plan Act (\"ARPA\"), we remeasured the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan. This resulted in a $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain in the first quarter. We completed the divestiture of UPS Freight on April 30, 2021, and used the cash proceeds of $848 million to reduce outstanding indebtedness. We recognized a pre-tax gain of $46 million for the year in respect of this transaction. The divestiture triggered a remeasurement of certain of our U.S. defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans, which had only an immaterial impact on results of operations for the year. For additional information on this divestiture, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. Following the divestiture, we renamed our Supply Chain & Freight businesses Supply Chain Solutions.\nIn October 2021, we completed the acquisition of Roadie, a technology platform focused on same-day delivery services, for $586 million. The results of Roadie are reported within Supply Chain Solutions. The acquisition did not have a material impact on our results of operations for the year. See note 9 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for additional information on this transaction.\n21\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nHighlights of our results for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, which are discussed in more detail in the sections that follow, include:\n•\nRevenue increased in all segments, with double digit revenue per piece growth in both U.S. Domestic Package and International Package.\n•\nAverage daily package volume increases were driven by growth in SMB and business-to-business volume.\n•\nOperating expenses increased, primarily driven by fuel and third-party transportation costs.\n•\nOperating profit and operating margin increased in global small package and Supply Chain Solutions.\n•\nWe reported net income of $12.9 billion and diluted earnings per share of $14.68. Adjusted diluted earnings per share was $12.13 after adjusting for the after-tax impacts of:\n◦\na gain on the divestiture of UPS Freight of $35 million or $0.04 per diluted share;\n◦\ntransformation strategy costs of $285 million or $0.32 per diluted share; and\n◦\na pension mark-to-market gain recognized outside of a 10% corridor of $2.5 billion or $2.83 per share.\nIn the U.S. Domestic Package segment, volume increases were driven by strong growth from SMBs. Revenue and revenue per piece increased through execution of our revenue quality initiatives, with favorable shifts in customer and product mix and base rate increases, as well as increases in fuel and demand-related surcharges. Expenses increased primarily due to higher fuel prices and increases in employee compensation and benefit costs, which were slightly offset by productivity improvements.\nThe International Package segment also experienced volume growth for the year, driven by business-to-business volume. Revenue and revenue per piece increased due to fuel and demand-related surcharges, base rate increases, shifts in customer and product mix and favorable currency movements. Expense increases were primarily due to higher network costs, driven by higher fuel prices, and volume growth, which resulted in additional third-party pickup and delivery expense.\nIn Supply Chain Solutions, the impact of divesting UPS Freight was more than offset by revenue growth from the remaining businesses, primarily Forwarding and Logistics. Forwarding growth was driven by higher volumes in our air and ocean freight businesses and market rate and base pricing increases. Within Logistics, we experienced strong growth in our healthcare operations. Expense increases in Supply Chain Solutions were primarily due to higher third-party transportation costs.\n2020 compared to 2019\nSee\nItem 7. Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations\nof the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 22, 2021.\n22\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSupplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability\nWe supplement the reporting of our financial information determined under generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (\"GAAP\") with certain non-GAAP financial measures. These include: \"adjusted\" compensation and benefits; operating expenses; operating profit; operating margin; other income and (expense); income before income taxes; income tax expense; effective tax rate; net income; and earnings per share. Adjusted financial measures may exclude the impact of period over period exchange rate changes and hedging activities, amounts related to mark-to-market gains or losses, transformation and other charges, goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures, as described below.\nWe believe that these non-GAAP measures provide additional meaningful information to assist users of our financial statements in more fully understanding our financial results and assessing our ongoing performance, because they exclude items that may not be indicative of, or are unrelated to, our underlying operations, and may provide a useful baseline for analyzing trends in our underlying businesses. These non-GAAP measures are used internally by management for business unit operating performance analysis, business unit resource allocation and in connection with incentive compensation award determinations.\nAdjusted financial measures should be considered in addition to, and not as an alternative for, our reported results prepared in accordance with GAAP. Our adjusted financial measures do not represent a comprehensive basis of accounting. Therefore, our adjusted financial measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies.\nAdjusted amounts reflect the following (in millions):\nThese items have been excluded from comparisons of \"adjusted\" compensation and benefits, operating expenses, operating profit, operating margin, other income and (expense), income tax expense and effective tax rate in the discussion that follows. The income tax impacts from transformation and other charges; mark-to-market gains and losses; goodwill and asset impairment charges, and divestitures are calculated by multiplying the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction, including the U.S. federal jurisdiction and various U.S. state and non-U.S. jurisdictions, by the tax-deductible adjustments. The blended average effective tax rates in 2021 and 2020 were 23.8% and 22.5%, respectively.\n23\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nTransformation and Other Charges, Goodwill and Asset Impairment Charges, and Divestitures\nWe supplement the presentation of our operating profit, operating margin, income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of charges related to transformation activities, goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures. For more information regarding transformation activities, see note 19 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. For more information regarding goodwill and asset impairment charges and divestitures, see note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nChanges in Foreign Currency Exchange Rates and Hedging Activities\nWe also supplement the reporting of revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit with adjusted measures that exclude the period over period impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes and hedging activities. We believe currency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit information allows users of our financial statements to understand growth trends in our products and results. We evaluate the performance of International Package and Supply Chain Solutions on this currency-neutral basis.\nCurrency-neutral revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit are calculated by dividing current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit by the current period average exchange rates to derive current period local currency revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit. The derived amounts are then multiplied by the average foreign currency exchange rates used to translate the comparable results for each month in the prior year period (including the period over period impact of foreign currency hedging activities). The difference between the current period reported U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit and the derived current period U.S. dollar revenue, revenue per piece and operating profit is the period over period impact of currency fluctuations.\nDefined Benefit Plans Mark-to-Market Impacts\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains and losses in excess of a 10% corridor for our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans immediately as part of\nInvestment income (expense) and other\nwithin\nOther Income and (Expense)\n. We supplement the presentation of our income before income taxes, net income and earnings per share with non-GAAP measures that exclude the impact of these gains and losses and the related income tax effects. We believe excluding these mark-to-market impacts provides important supplemental information by removing the volatility associated with short-term changes in market interest rates, equity values and similar factors.\nInvestment income (expense) and other\nreflects the actual return on plan assets (9.11% in 2021 and 12.54% in 2020) and the discount rate used to measure the projected benefit obligation at the December 31st measurement date (3.11% in 2021 and 2.87% in 2020).\nAdjusted Investment income (expense) and other\nutilizes the expected return on plan assets (6.40% in 2021 and 7.70% in 2020) and the discount rate used to determine net periodic benefit cost (2.87% in 2021 and 3.55% in 2020).\nThe remeasurement of our pension and postretirement defined benefit plans' assets and liabilities resulted in a $3.3 billion mark-to-market gain in 2021 and $6.5 billion loss in 2020.\n24\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe table below shows the amounts associated with each component of the pre-tax mark-to-market gain (loss), as well as the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine our net periodic benefit cost, for each year:\nThe pre-tax mark-to-market gains and losses for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 consisted of the following:\n2021 - $3.3 billion pre-tax mark-to-market gain:\n•\nDiscount Rates\n($1.9 billion pre-tax gain):\nThis gain was driven by the interim remeasurement of the UPS/IBT Plan in the first quarter of 2021. The weighted-average discount rate for our UPS/IBT Plan increased from 2.98% as of December 31, 2020 to 3.70% as of March 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in U.S. treasury yields.\n•\nReturn on Assets\n($0.3 billion pre-tax loss): This loss was primarily driven by the interim remeasurement of the UPS/IBT Plan in the first quarter of 2021. As of March 2021, the actual rate of return on the plan assets was approximately 220 basis points lower than our expected rate of return, primarily due to weak global equity and U.S. bond market performance.\n•\nDemographic and Other Assumption Changes\n($0.1 billion pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.\n•\nCoordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund\n($1.8 billion pre-tax gain): This represents the reduction of the liability for potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund.\n2020 - $6.5 billion pre-tax mark-to-market loss:\n•\nDiscount Rates\n($6.5 billion pre-tax loss):\nThe weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from 3.55% as of December 31, 2019 to 2.87% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n•\nReturn on Assets\n($2.4 billion pre-tax gain): In 2020, the actual rate of return on plan assets was higher than our expected rate of return, primarily due to strong global equity and U.S. bond market performance.\n•\nDemographic and Other Assumption Changes\n($0.4 billion pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation rate increases and rates of termination, retirement and mortality.\n•\nCoordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund\n($2.0 billion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund.\n25\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nExpense Allocations\nCertain operating expenses are allocated between our operating segments using activity-based costing methods. These activity-based costing methods require us to make estimates that impact the amount of each expense category that is attributed to each segment. Changes in these estimates would directly impact the amount of expense allocated to each segment, and therefore the operating profit of each reporting segment. Our allocation methodologies are refined periodically, as necessary, to reflect changes in our businesses.\nIn the first quarter of 2021, we updated our cost allocation methodology for aircraft engine maintenance expense to better align with aircraft utilization by segment. This change resulted in a reallocation of expense from our U.S. Domestic Package segment to our International Package segment of approximately $73 million for the year.\nUpon the divestiture of UPS Freight, revenue and costs associated with the Ground with Freight Pricing (\"GFP\") product began to be reported in U.S. Domestic Package.\n26\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nU.S. Domestic Package\nRevenue\nThe change in revenue was due to the following factors:\nVolume\nAverage daily volume increased slightly, driven by SMB customer volume growth of 18% as a result of the continued execution of the\nCustomer First\ncomponent of our strategy, which was partially offset by a decline in Ground residential volume from our large customers. We anticipate this decline will moderate in 2022 and be offset by growth in Ground residential volume from our SMB customers. We expect overall volume growth levels in 2022 will remain consistent with 2021.\n27\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nBusiness-to-consumer shipments represented approximately 60.7% of average daily volume compared to 63.6% in 2020. The decrease in 2021 was attributable to elevated e-commerce spending and a reduction in business-to-business activity in 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Business-to-business shipments increased 9.4%, primarily in our Ground commercial product, as business activity largely recovered from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic.\nAverage daily volume in our Next Day Air product increased as a result of the increase in business-to-business activity from SMBs and large customers. Higher residential demand also contributed to the growth in Next Day Air. Deferred volume decreased but remained slightly above pre-pandemic levels, with shifts in customer mix impacting product demand.\nSurePost average daily volume decreased 10.7%, driven by declines in volume from large customers. Ground commercial volume increased 7.0%, with growth in all customer segments.\nRates and Product Mix\nOverall revenue per piece increased in all customer segments, driven by increases in base rates and the increase in commercial volume discussed above. Revenue per piece was favorably impacted by the growth in SMB volume resulting from continued execution of our strategy, and from demand-related and fuel surcharges. Rates for ground and air services increased an average of 4.9% in December 2020, and our SurePost rates also increased at that time. We anticipate demand-related surcharges will remain largely unchanged in 2022.\nRevenue per piece for our Next Day Air and Deferred products increased as a result of the factors described above. The increase was slightly offset by the impact of a reduction in average billable weight per piece. Revenue per piece for our Ground product increased due to an increase in average billable weight per piece in addition to the factors described above.\nWe are focused on continuing to grow revenue per piece through execution of our strategy.\nFuel Surcharges\nWe apply a fuel surcharge on our domestic air and ground services that is adjusted weekly. The air fuel surcharge is based on the U.S. Department of Energy’s (“DOE”) Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel, while the ground fuel surcharge is based on the DOE’s On-Highway Diesel Fuel Price. Based on published rates, the average fuel surcharge rates for domestic Air and Ground products were as follows:\nWhile fluctuations in fuel surcharges can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges are only one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and additional charges for these services and the pricing discounts offered.\nTotal domestic fuel surcharge revenue increased by $1.3 billion, driven by a significant increase in fuel surcharge indices. We expect the impact of these increases will continue in 2022.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses, and operating expenses excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased, driven by a $1.7 billion increase in the cost of operating our integrated air and ground network and a $1.7 billion increase in pickup and delivery costs. In addition, the cost of package sorting increased $514 million and other indirect operating costs increased by $245 million. The increase in expense was driven by:\n•\nHigher fuel costs, primarily attributable to increases in the price of jet fuel, diesel and gasoline, which we expect to persist.\n•\nHigher employee benefit expense for our union workforce due to contractual contribution rate increases to multiemployer plans and additional headcount becoming eligible for health, welfare and retirement benefits.\n28\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nAdditional compensation expense due to contractual rate increases for our union workforce. Cost of living and wage-rate adjustments driven by inflation and other market factors also drove higher compensation costs. Volume growth also contributed to the increase. These increases were partially offset by productivity improvements. Management payroll increased, primarily due to incentive compensation and commission payments.\n•\nHigher third-party transportation costs as a result of our investments to improve time-in-transit within our ground network partially offset by lower third-party carrier costs for SurePost and rail due to lower volumes.\n•\nThe reallocation of expense for the GFP product following the divestiture of UPS Freight resulted in an increase of $281 million in segment operating expenses.\nTotal cost per piece, and adjusted cost per piece excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased 7.4%. We anticipate that overall costs and cost per piece may continue to increase during 2022 as a result of contractual cost increases and market factors, including inflation and the availability and cost of labor. We expect this expense growth to moderate in 2022 due to additional operational improvements.\nOperating Profit and Margin\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit increased $2.5 billion, with operating margin increasing 340 basis points to 10.7%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, adjusted operating profit increased $2.6 billion, with adjusting operating margin increasing 340 basis points to 11.1%.\n29\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nInternational Package\nRevenue\nThe change in revenue was due to the following:\n30\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nVolume\nAverage daily volume increased for both domestic and export products, with growth primarily in the first half of the year. Volume declined in the fourth quarter, largely due to the year-over-year impacts of COVID-19 on consumer behavior. For the year, we experienced growth from both SMBs and large customers, primarily in the retail, manufacturing and technology sectors. Business-to-business volume increased 10.8% as commercial activity largely returned to pre-pandemic levels. Business-to-consumer volume increased 5.1%, with growth primarily in the first quarter when COVID-19 driven volume was not present in the comparative period. We expect overall volume growth to accelerate in 2022.\nExport volume increased for the year, led by Europe and the Americas, while Asia volume was largely unchanged. Volume growth was strongest on intra-Europe trade lanes, as well as from Europe and the Americas to the United States. Trade between Europe and the United Kingdom declined throughout the year as a result of Brexit, which became effective on January 1, 2021. Asia export volume grew significantly in the first quarter, but was then impacted in the second quarter by a reduction in shipments of personal protective equipment relative to 2020. Additionally, COVID-19 impacts within the region reduced the number of flights operated in the second half of the year.\nPremium products saw volume growth of 14.9%, driven by Worldwide Express and Transborder Express products. Volume for non-premium products increased 6.9%, driven by growth in our Transborder Standard product. Worldwide Standard volume increased primarily as a result of Brexit, with shipments between the United Kingdom and the European Union that are now subject to duties and taxes shifting from Transborder to Worldwide products.\nDomestic volume increased for the year in many markets, with the strongest growth in the United Kingdom and Western Europe, largely due to the impact of COVID-19 on business-to-consumer demand. During the fourth quarter, domestic volume declined, driven by a reduction in e-commerce resulting in fewer residential deliveries, that was slightly offset by growth in commercial volume.\nRates and Product Mix\nIn December 2020, we implemented an average 4.9% net increase in base and accessorial rates for international shipments originating in the United States. Rate changes for shipments originating outside the U.S. are made throughout the year and vary by geographic market. In response to capacity constraints resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to apply demand-related surcharges on certain lanes in the second quarter of 2020. These surcharges are expected to remain elevated in 2022.\nTotal revenue per piece increased 14.4%, driven by changes in base pricing, fuel and demand-related surcharges and favorable shifts in customer and product mix. Currency movements contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year, but had a negative impact in the fourth quarter. Excluding the impact of currency, revenue per piece increased 12.0% for the year.\nExport revenue per piece increased 15.1% as a result of the factors described above. Excluding the impact of currency movements, export revenue per piece increased 13.2%.\nDomestic revenue per piece increased 9.9% due to changes in base pricing, fuel surcharges and customer and product mix. Although currency movements negatively impacted revenue per piece in the fourth quarter, they contributed to the increase in revenue per piece for the year. Excluding the impact of currency movements, revenue per piece increased 5.6%.\nWe expect revenue per piece growth to moderate in 2022.\nFuel Surcharges\nThe fuel surcharge for international air services originating inside or outside the U.S. is largely indexed to the DOE's Gulf Coast spot price for a gallon of kerosene-type jet fuel. The fuel surcharges for ground services originating outside the U.S. are indexed to fuel prices in the region or country where the shipment originates.\nWhile fluctuations can be significant from period to period, fuel surcharges represent one of the many individual components of our market pricing strategy that impact our overall revenue and yield. Additional components include the mix of services sold, the base price and extra service charges and any pricing discounts offered. Total international fuel surcharge revenue increased by $866 million, primarily due to increases in fuel surcharge indices, as well as overall volume growth and changes in customer and product mix.\n31\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses, and operating expenses excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased. The costs of operating our integrated international air and ground network increased $1.2 billion driven by the impact of higher fuel prices and volume growth. We expect these trends to continue in 2022.\nIn addition to variability in usage and market prices, the manner in which we purchase fuel also influences the net impact of costs on our results. The majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for fuel. Because of this, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our earnings either positively or negatively in the short-term.\nPickup and delivery costs increased $718 million, primarily due to volume growth that drove additional third-party transportation expense. Package sorting costs increased $198 million, also as a result of overall volume growth. We anticipate that these operating expenses may continue to increase due to volume growth and external market factors, such as fuel prices and inflation.\nThe remaining increase in operating expenses was due to increases in other indirect operating costs.\nOperating Profit and Margin\nAs a result of the factors described above, operating profit increased $1.2 billion, with operating margin increasing 230 basis points to 23.8%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, adjusted operating profit also increased $1.2 billion, with operating margin increasing 200 basis points to 24.2%.\n32\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSupply Chain Solutions\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight. For the year ended December 31, 2021, we recognized a pre-tax gain of $46 million related to this divestiture. See note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for additional information.\n33\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nRevenue\nTotal revenue for Supply Chain Solutions increased $2.2 billion.\nForwarding revenue increased for the year. In our international air freight business, revenue growth was driven by higher volume as a result of strong outbound demand globally. Demand-related surcharges and rate increases also contributed to revenue growth as demand continued to exceed capacity in the market. We expect the elevated level of demand to persist. Ocean freight forwarding revenue increased, driven by Asia-export volume and higher market rates throughout the year. We expect surcharges for ocean freight forwarding to be lower in 2022 relative to 2021 as supply and demand within the market begins to normalize. Revenue in our truckload brokerage business increased due to market rate increases and the continued execution of our strategy, slightly offset by a reduction in volume.\nWithin Logistics, our healthcare operations experienced strong revenue growth across a broad range of customers, including COVID-19 relief efforts. Revenue in our mail services business increased as a result of rate increases and a favorable shift in product characteristics, partially offset by lower volumes. Our other distribution operations experienced year-over-year revenue increases, driven by new business growth.\nAs a result of the divestiture, UPS Freight revenue decreased $2.1 billion for the year.\nRevenue from the other businesses within Supply Chain Solutions increased, driven by services provided to the acquirer of UPS Freight under certain transition services agreements and by growth in our logistics consulting services, UPS Capital and additional volume from service contracts with the U.S. Postal Service.\nOperating Expenses\nTotal operating expenses for Supply Chain Solutions, and operating expenses excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased in 2021.\nForwarding operating expenses increased $2.6 billion, driven by an increase in purchased transportation of $2.5 billion. This increase was primarily due to higher market rates across all of our forwarding businesses that were driven by supply constraints and demand-related surcharges, as well as volume growth in our international air freight and ocean freight forwarding businesses. Capacity constraints are expected to persist, resulting in purchased transportation cost remaining elevated.\nLogistics operating expenses increased $538 million, due to higher purchased transportation expense and operational expense growth in our healthcare operations as a result of COVID-19 relief efforts and strong demand for our healthcare logistics services. Carrier rate increases drove higher expense within mail services and business growth in our other distribution operations also resulted in additional purchased transportation expense.\nUPS Freight operating expenses decreased $2.8 billion as a result of the divestiture.\nExpense for the other businesses within Supply Chain Solutions increased, primarily due to higher third-party transportation expense in logistics consulting and transportation and other costs incurred under transition services agreements with the acquirer of UPS Freight.\nOperating Profit and Margin\nAs a result of the factors described above, total operating profit increased $1.4 billion, with operating margin increasing 750 basis points to 9.9%. Excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges and other gains, adjusted operating profit increased $649 million, with adjusted operating margin increasing 280 basis points to 9.8%.\n34\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nConsolidated Operating Expenses\n35\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCompensation and Benefits\nTotal compensation and benefits, and total compensation and benefits excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased in 2021.\nTotal compensation costs, and total compensation costs excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, increased $1.0 billion or 3.8%, primarily as a result of:\n•\nU.S. Domestic compensation increased $704 million as a result of higher direct labor costs due to contractual rate increases for our union workforce, as well as wage-rate and cost of living adjustments driven by inflation and other market factors. Volume growth drove additional headcount and an increase in average daily union hours, which was partially offset by productivity improvements.\n•\nInternational cost increased $380 million, primarily due to volume growth, as well as the impacts of operational disruption last year that resulted from COVID-19 restrictions.\n•\nManagement compensation increased $416 million due to salary increases, higher incentive compensation and sales commissions and workforce growth that was primarily from additional part-time positions.\n•\nThese increases were partially offset by the impact of divesting UPS Freight, which decreased cost by $583 million.\nBenefits costs increased $1.3 billion. Excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, adjusted benefits increased $1.2 billion as a result of:\n•\nHealth and welfare costs increased $530 million, driven by increased contributions to multiemployer plans resulting from growth in the eligible workforce and contractual rate increases.\n•\nPension and postretirement benefits increased $374 million due to an increase in the overall size of the workforce, increased contributions to multiemployer plans as a result of contractually-mandated rate increases and higher service costs for company-sponsored plans.\n•\nVacation, excused absence, payroll taxes and other expenses increased $212 million, primarily driven by salary increases, increases in the overall size of the workforce and additional discretionary payments to certain employees.\n•\nWorkers' compensation expense increased $51 million due to an increase in total hours worked and higher claim counts, partially offset by improved claims trends relative to the previous year and lower activity resulting from the divestiture of UPS Freight.\nRepairs and Maintenance\nThe increase in repairs and maintenance expense was driven by additional aircraft engine maintenance cost, primarily due to the increase in operating activity. Routine repairs and maintenance for buildings and facilities, and maintenance costs for our other transportation equipment, increased slightly.\nDepreciation and Amortization\nDepreciation and amortization expense increased as a result of additional operating facilities coming into service and investments in internally developed software, as well as growth in the size of our vehicle and aircraft fleets.\nPurchased Transportation\nThe increase in purchased transportation expense charged to us by third-party air, ocean and truck carriers was primarily driven by:\n•\nSupply Chain Solutions expense increased $2.2 billion, primarily due to market rate and volume increases in our international air freight and ocean freight businesses and rate increases in our truckload brokerage business. These increases were partially offset by the impact of the divestiture of UPS Freight, which reduced third-party transportation costs by $596 million.\n•\nInternational Package expense increased $617 million, primarily due to additional volume being handled by third-party pickup and delivery services in Asia and Europe. Currency movements also negatively impacted expense, primarily in Europe.\n36\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n•\nU.S. Domestic Package expense increased $310 million due to ongoing investments to improve time-in-transit in our U.S. ground network and overall increases in per-shipment costs. These impacts were partially offset by decreases in rail and SurePost volumes for the year.\nFuel\nHigher fuel prices increased expense $1.2 billion. Increases in usage from additional aircraft block hours and miles driven were partly offset by the impact of the divestiture of UPS Freight.\nOther Occupancy\nThe increase in other occupancy expense, and other occupancy expense excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation and other charges, was due to higher utilities costs, rent and property tax increases and ongoing facility maintenance.\nOther Expenses\nOther expenses, and other expenses excluding the year-over-year impact of transformation strategy costs and goodwill, asset impairment charges and divestitures, increased as a result of:\n•\nOther operational expenses, including vehicle and equipment rentals, increased $214 million, primarily driven by business growth.\n•\nThe cost of business services that support our operating segments increased $129 million, driven by business growth and the expansion of services provided.\n•\nCustomer claims increased $108 million, driven by changes to our claims policy, which resulted in higher claims for lost packages.\n•\nOther increases included the cost of goods provided under transitional service agreements to the acquirer of UPS Freight, information technology expenses, payment processing fees and the write down of certain construction in progress activities.\nThese increases were partially offset by reductions in self-insured automobile liability claims due to improvements in claims experience, a reduction in our allowance for credit losses and a reduction in purchases of COVID-related safety and cleaning supplies.\n37\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nOther Income and (Expense)\nThe following table sets forth investment income (expense) and other and interest expense for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nInvestment Income (Expense) and Other\nInvestment and other income increased $9.6 billion, primarily due to a net $3.3 billion mark-to-market gain from remeasurements of our defined benefit plans in 2021 compared to a $6.5 billion loss in 2020. Excluding the impact of these mark-to-market gains and losses, adjusted investment and other income decreased $138 million, driven by a decrease in other pension income which includes expected returns on pension assets, net of interest cost on projected benefit obligations and prior service costs.\n•\nExpected returns on pension assets decreased due to a reduction in our expected rate of return assumption. This was partially offset by a higher asset base due to discretionary contributions and positive asset returns in 2020.\n•\nPension interest cost decreased, driven by a reduction in projected benefit obligations following interim plan remeasurements. The interim plan remeasurements were triggered by the signing into law of the ARPA in March 2021 and by the divestiture of UPS Freight in April 2021. We also experienced a reduction in prior service cost.\nThe remaining items in other income decreased due to foreign currency losses, partially offset by net gains from certain non-current investments.\nInterest Expense\nInterest expense for the year decreased due to lower average outstanding debt balances and lower effective interest rates on floating rate debt and commercial paper, partially offset by a reduction in capitalization of interest.\n38\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Tax Expense\nThe following table sets forth income tax expense and our effective tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nFor additional information on income tax expense and our effective tax rate, see note 16 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\n39\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nLiquidity and Capital Resources\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $10.6 billion in cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. We believe that these positions, expected cash from operations, access to commercial paper programs and capital markets and other available liquidity options will be adequate to fund our material short- and long-term cash requirements, including our business operations, planned capital expenditures and pension contributions, transformation strategy costs, debt obligations and planned shareowner returns. We regularly evaluate opportunities to optimize our capital structure, including through issuances of debt to refinance existing debt and to fund operations. We deploy a disciplined and balanced approach to capital allocation, including returns to shareowners through dividends and share repurchases.\nCash Flows From Operating Activities\nThe following is a summary of the significant sources (uses) of cash from operating activities (in millions):\n(a) Represents depreciation and amortization, gains and losses on derivative transactions and foreign currency exchange, deferred income taxes, allowances for expected credit losses, amortization of operating lease assets, pension and postretirement benefit plan (income) expense, stock compensation expense, changes in casualty self-insurance reserves, goodwill and other asset impairment charges and other non-cash items.\nNet cash from operating activities increased $4.5 billion year to date, primarily due to improved performance. Additional impacts included:\n•\nContributions to our company-sponsored pension and U.S. postretirement medical benefit plans totaled $576 million and $3.1 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively. This included discretionary contributions of $200 million and $2.8 billion, respectively.\n•\nOur net hedge margin collateral position increased by $779 million due to changes in the fair value of derivative contracts used in our currency and interest rate hedging programs.\n•\nCash payments for income taxes were $1.9 billion and $1.1 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively, with changes primarily driven by an increase in income.\n•\nDuring 2020, our working capital benefited from a one-time deferral of employer payroll taxes of approximately $1.1 billion under the CARES Act. During the fourth quarter of 2021, we paid $577 million of these deferred employer payroll taxes. Other changes in working capital were driven by business growth and the timing of duty and tax settlements.\nAs part of our ongoing efforts to improve our working capital efficiency, certain financial institutions offer a Supply Chain Finance (\"SCF\") program to certain of our suppliers. We agree to commercial terms with our suppliers, including prices, quantities and payment terms, regardless of whether the supplier elects to participate in the SCF program. Suppliers issue invoices to us based on the agreed-upon contractual terms. If they participate in the SCF program, our suppliers, at their sole discretion, determine which invoices, if any, to sell to the financial institutions. Our suppliers’ voluntary inclusion of invoices in the SCF program has no bearing on our payment terms. No guarantees are provided by us under the SCF program. We have no economic interest in a supplier’s decision to participate, and we have no direct financial relationship with the financial institutions, as it relates to the SCF program.\n40\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAmounts due to our suppliers that participate in the SCF program are included in\nAccounts payable\nin our consolidated balance sheets. We have been informed by the participating financial institutions that as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, suppliers sold them $545 and $639 million, respectively, of our outstanding payment obligations. Amounts due to suppliers that participate in the SCF program may be reflected in cash flows from operating activities or cash flows from investing activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows. The amounts settled through the SCF program were approximately $1.7 and $1.8 billion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nAs of December 31, 2021, approximately $3.1 billion of our total worldwide holdings of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign subsidiaries. The amount of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by our U.S. and foreign subsidiaries fluctuates throughout the year due to a variety of factors, including the timing of cash receipts and disbursements in the normal course of business. Cash provided by operating activities in the U.S. continues to be our primary source of funds to finance domestic operating needs, capital expenditures, share repurchases, pension contributions and dividend payments to shareowners. All cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities held by foreign subsidiaries are generally available for distribution to the U.S. without any U.S. federal income taxes. Any such distributions may be subject to foreign withholding and U.S. state taxes. When amounts earned by foreign subsidiaries are expected to be indefinitely reinvested, no accrual for taxes is provided.\n41\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash Flows From Investing Activities\nOur primary sources (uses) of cash from investing activities for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIn addition to capital expenditures of $4.2 and $5.4 billion in 2021 and 2020, respectively, there were capital expenditures relating to principal repayments of finance lease obligations of $208 and $192 million, respectively. These are included in cash flows from financing activities.\nWe have commitments for the purchase of aircraft, vehicles, equipment and real estate to provide for the replacement of existing capacity and anticipated future growth. Future capital spending for anticipated growth and replacement assets will depend on a variety of factors, including economic and industry conditions. Our current investment program anticipates investments in technology initiatives and enhanced network capabilities, including over $1 billion of projects to support our environmental sustainability goals. It also provides for maintenance of buildings, facilities and plant equipment and replacement of certain aircraft within our fleet. We currently expect that our capital expenditures will be approximately $5.5 billion in 2022, of which approximately 60 percent will be allocated to expansion projects.\nIn 2021, capital expenditures on buildings, facilities and operating equipment decreased in our global small package business, as we reduced spending on facility expansion projects. Capital spending on aircraft increased slightly as final payments associated with the delivery of aircraft were largely offset by reductions in contract deposits on open aircraft orders. Capital expenditures on information technology decreased due to the timing of projects.\nProceeds from the disposal of businesses, property, plant and equipment increased as we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight for cash proceeds of $848 million in the second quarter. The proceeds were used to reduce outstanding indebtedness.\nThe net change in finance receivables was primarily due to reductions in outstanding balances within our finance portfolios. Purchases and sales of marketable securities are largely determined by liquidity needs and the periodic rebalancing of investment types, and will fluctuate from period to period.\nCash paid for business acquisitions in 2021 was primarily attributable to the acquisition of Roadie and the purchase of development areas for The UPS Store. Cash paid for business acquisitions in 2020 related to the purchase of development areas for The UPS Store. Other investing activities were impacted by changes in our non-current investments, purchase contract deposits and various other items.\n42\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCash Flows From Financing Activities\nOur primary sources (uses) of cash for financing activities were as follows (amounts in millions, except per share data):\nWe repurchased 2.6 million shares of class B common stock for $500 million under our stock repurchase program in 2021. We repurchased 2.1 million shares of class A and class B common stock for $217 million in 2020 ($224 million in repurchases is reported on the statement of cash flows for 2020 due to the timing of settlements). For additional information on our share repurchase activities, see note 13 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nFor the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, dividends reported within shareowners' equity include $167 and $178 million, respectively, of non-cash dividends that were settled in shares of class A common stock.\nThe declaration of dividends is subject to the discretion of the Board and depends on various factors, including our net income, financial condition, cash requirements, future prospects and other relevant factors. In the first quarter of 2022, we increased our quarterly dividend from $1.02 to $1.52 per share.\n43\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIssuances of debt in 2021 consisted of short-term borrowings under our commercial paper program, of which none remained outstanding as of December 31, 2021. Issuances of debt in 2020 consisted of borrowings under our commercial paper program and issuances of fixed-rate senior notes as follows (in millions):\nRepayments of debt in 2021 included our $1.5 billion 3.125% senior notes, our $700 million 2.050% senior notes and our $350 million floating rate senior notes. We also reduced our commercial paper balances and made scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations. Repayments of debt in 2020 included our $424 million 8.375% debentures and our €500 million floating rate senior notes. We also paid down commercial paper balances and made scheduled principal payments on our finance lease obligations.\nWe have $2.0 billion of fixed and floating rate notes that mature in 2022. We may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings, depending on various factors. We consider the overall fixed and floating interest rate mix of our portfolio and the related overall cost of borrowing when planning for future issuances and non-scheduled repayments of debt.\nThe amount of commercial paper outstanding fluctuates throughout the year based on daily liquidity needs. The following is a summary of our commercial paper program (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had no outstanding balances under our U.S. and European commercial paper program.\nExcept as disclosed in note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we do not have guarantees or other off-balance sheet financing arrangements, including variable interest entities, which we believe could have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\nThe variation in cash received from common stock issuances was driven by the number of stock options exercised by employees and movements in other employee-related plans in 2021 and 2020.\nOther financing activities includes cash used to repurchase shares to satisfy tax withholding obligations on vested stock awards of $358 and $340 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively. The increase in cash used was driven by changes in payment levels for certain of our awards.\n44\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSources of Credit\nSee note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of our available credit and debt covenants.\nContractual Commitments\nWe have material cash requirements for known contractual obligations and commitments in the form of finance leases, operating leases, debt obligations, purchase commitments and certain other liabilities that are disclosed in the notes to the audited, consolidated financial statements and discussed below. We expect to fund these obligations and other discretionary payments, including expected returns to shareowners, primarily through cash from operations.\nWe anticipate making discretionary contributions to our company-sponsored U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans of approximately $1.9 billion in 2022, which are included within\nExpected employer contributions to plan trusts\nshown in note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. There are currently no anticipated required minimum cash contributions to our qualified U.S. pension plans. The amount of any minimum funding requirement, as applicable, for these plans could change significantly in future periods depending on many factors, including plan asset returns, discount rates, other actuarial assumptions, changes to pension plan funding regulations and the discretionary contributions that we make. Actual contributions made in future years could materially differ and consequently required minimum contributions beyond 2022 cannot be reasonably estimated.\nAs discussed in note 7 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, we are not currently subject to any minimum contributions or surcharges with respect to the multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans in which we participate. Contribution rates to these multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans are established through the collective bargaining process.\nWe have outstanding letters of credit and surety bonds that are discussed in note 10 to the audited, consolidated financial statements. Additionally, we have $2.0 billion of fixed- and floating-rate senior notes that mature in 2022. We may repay these amounts when due with cash generated from operations or other borrowings, depending on various factors. Annual principal payments on our long-term debt, estimated debt interest obligations and purchase commitments are also set out in note 10.\nIncluded within purchase commitments as disclosed in note 10, we have firm commitments to purchase two new Boeing 747-8F aircraft to be delivered in 2022 and 19 new Boeing 767-300 aircraft to be delivered between 2023 and 2025. We have an option to purchase an additional 8 new Boeing 767-300 aircraft for delivery in 2025 and 2026 which are not reflected in our purchase commitments.\nOur finance lease obligations, including purchase options that are reasonably certain to be exercised, relate primarily to leases on aircraft and real estate. These obligations, together with our obligations under operating leases are set out in note 12 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nUnder provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the \"Tax Act\"), we elected to pay a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries over eight years through 2025. Additionally, we have uncertain tax positions that are further discussed in note 16 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nIn 2022, we will pay $558 million of employer payroll taxes that we deferred under the CARES Act.\nContingencies\nSee note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of pension related matters and note 11 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business activities.\n45\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

These agreements set forth the annual contribution rate increases for the plans that we participate in.\nNew Accounting Pronouncements\nRecently Adopted Accounting Standards\nSee note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of recently adopted accounting standards.\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective\nSee note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for a discussion of accounting standards issued, but not yet effective.\nRate Adjustments\nFrom time to time we adjust published rates applicable to our services. These rates, when published, are made available on our website at\nwww.ups.com\n. We provide the address to our internet site solely for information. We do not intend for this address to be an active link or to otherwise incorporate the contents of any website into this or any other report we file with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n46\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nCritical Accounting Estimates\nThe amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses reported in our financial statements are affected by estimates and judgments that are necessary to comply with GAAP. We base our estimates on prior experience, current trends, various other assumptions and third-party input that we consider reasonable to our circumstances. Actual results could differ materially from our estimates, which would affect the related amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements. While estimates and judgments are applied in arriving at many reported amounts, we believe that the following critical accounting estimates involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity.\nContingencies\nFrom time to time, we are involved in various legal proceedings and have exposure to various other contingent obligations. The events that may impact our contingent liabilities are often unique and generally are not predictable. At the time a contingency is identified, we consider all relevant facts as part of our evaluation. We apply judgment when establishing a range of reasonably possible losses for our contingencies. Our judgment is influenced by our understanding of information currently available for legal actions and potential outcomes of these actions, including the advice from our internal counsel, external counsel and senior management\n.\nWe record a liability for a loss when the loss is probable of occurring and reasonably estimable. For such accruals, we record the amount we consider to be the best estimate within a range of potential losses; however, when there appears to be a range of equally possible losses, our accrual is based on the low-end of this range. The likelihood of a loss with respect to a particular contingency is often difficult to predict and determining a reasonable estimate of the loss or a range of loss may not be practicable based on the information available. Additionally, events may arise that were not anticipated and, as a result, the outcome of a contingency may result in a loss that differs materially from our previously estimated liability. Except as disclosed in note 11 to the audited, consolidated financial statements, contingent losses that were probable and estimable were not material to our financial position or results of operations as of, or for the year ended, December 31, 2021. In addition, we have certain contingent liabilities that have not been recognized as of, or for the year ended, December 31, 2021, because a loss was not reasonably estimable. Obligations relating to income taxes and self-insurance are discussed below.\nGoodwill and Intangible Asset Impairments\nWe assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level. The determination of reporting units requires judgment, and if we changed the definition of our reporting units, it is possible that we would have reached different conclusions when performing our impairment tests.\nWe initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we quantitatively assess the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment. This assessment uses a combination of income and market approaches:\n•\nThe income approach uses a discounted cash flow (“DCF”) model, which requires us to make a number of significant assumptions to produce an estimate of future cash flows. These assumptions include projections of future revenue, costs, capital expenditures, working capital and the cost of capital. We are also required to make assumptions relating to our overall business and operating strategy, and the regulatory and market environment. Changes in any of these assumptions could significantly impact the fair value of any one of our reporting units. The projections that we use in our DCF model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions for each of our reporting units.\n•\nThe market approach uses observable market data of comparable public companies to estimate fair value utilizing financial metrics (such as enterprise value to net sales). We apply judgment to select appropriate comparison companies based on the business operations, size and operating results of our reporting units. Changes to our selection of comparable companies may result in changes to the estimates of fair value of our reporting units.\nFor reporting units tested using a quantitative model during 2021, we concluded the fair value of each reporting unit exceeded its carrying value by more than 10 percent. Our truckload brokerage reporting unit was most sensitive to changes in valuation assumptions. The ratio of excess fair value of this reporting unit to its carrying value would decrease by approximately one percentage point if the cost of capital increased by ten basis points.\n47\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nGoodwill impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. None of our reporting units incurred any goodwill impairment charges in 2021. During 2020, we recognized a goodwill impairment charge of $494 million in our UPS Freight reporting unit in conjunction with our evaluation of assets held for sale, which is discussed in note 4 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nWe evaluate the indefinite-lived trade name associated with our truckload brokerage business for impairment using the relief from royalty method. This valuation approach requires that we make a number of assumptions to estimate fair value, including projections of future revenues, market royalty rates, tax rates, discount rates and other relevant variables. The projections we use in the model are updated annually and will change over time based on the historical performance and changing business conditions. If the carrying value of the trade name exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge would be recognized for the excess amount.\nOur annual impairment test for the current year indicated that the fair value of the indefinite-lived trade name remained greater than its carrying value, although this excess was less than 10 percent. Our valuation estimate was most sensitive to changes in royalty rates and the cost of capital. The ratio of excess fair value to carrying value would decrease by approximately one percentage point if the royalty rate decreased by five basis points or the cost of capital increased by ten basis points. Our truckload brokerage business has been negatively impacted by increases in the market rates at which it purchases transportation, which has in turn negatively impacted its operating margins. Business performance below current forecasts or unfavorable changes in valuation assumptions, such as a lower royalty rate or higher cost of capital, could result in an impairment of the trade name in the future.\nOur finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairment tests for these assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the intangible is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are estimated using a DCF model. If impairment indicators are present, the resulting impairment charges could have a material impact on our results of operations. See note 8 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for details of finite-lived intangible asset impairments.\nSelf-Insurance Accruals\nWe base self-insurance reserves on actuarial estimates, which are determined, with the assistance of third-party actuaries, through a complex process that includes the application of various actuarial methods and assumptions. The process incorporates actual loss experience and judgments about expected future development based on historical experience, recent and projected trends in claim frequency and severity, and changes in claims handling practices, among other factors.\nWorkers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to resolve. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to resolve a claim. Several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in healthcare costs, the results of any related litigation and changes in legislation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior policy period at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. All these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We increased our total reserves related to prior year claims by $34 million and $169 million in 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nDue to the complexity and inherent uncertainty associated with the estimation of our workers’ compensation, automobile and general liability claims, the third-party actuary develops a range of expected losses. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate; however, actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity of a claim could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.\nWe also sponsor several health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. Liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, global health events, anticipated utilization by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation. We believe our estimates are reasonable and appropriate. Actual experience may differ materially from these estimates and, therefore, produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results.\n48\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nSelf-insurance reserves as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\n(1)\nIncluded within Other Non-Current Liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets.\nA five percent reduction or improvement in the assumed claim severity and claim frequency rates used to estimate our self-insurance reserves would result in an increase or decrease of approximately $290 million, respectively, in our reserves and expenses as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2021.\nPension and Other Postretirement Medical Benefits\nOur pension and other postretirement medical benefit costs are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies. These assumptions include discount rates, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increases, expected returns on plan assets, mortality rates, regulatory requirements and other factors. The assumptions utilized in recording the obligations under our plans represent our best estimates, and we believe that they are reasonable, based on information as to historical experience and performance as well as other factors that might cause future expectations to differ from past trends.\nDifferences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension and other postretirement obligations and future expenses. The primary factors contributing to actuarial gains and losses each year are:\n•\nChanges in the discount rate used to value pension and postretirement benefit obligations as of the measurement date;\n•\nDifferences between expected and the actual return on plan assets;\n•\nChanges in demographic assumptions including mortality;\n•\nDifferences in participant experience from demographic assumptions; and\n•\nChanges in coordinating benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS.\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plans' projected benefit obligations) in pension expense upon remeasurement of a plan. The remaining components of pension expense (referred to as \"ongoing net periodic benefit cost\"), primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are reported on a quarterly basis.\n49\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThe following sensitivity analysis shows the impact of a 25 basis point change in the assumed discount rate and return on assets for our pension and postretirement benefit plans, and the resulting increase (decrease) in our obligations and expense as of, and for the year ended, December 31, 2021 (in millions):\n(1)\nAmount calculated based on 25 basis point increase / decrease in the expected return on assets.\n(2)\nAmount calculated based on 25 basis point increase / decrease in the actual return on assets.\nRefer to note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for information on our potential liability for coordinating benefits related to the Central States Pension Fund.\nDepreciation, Residual Value and Impairment of Fixed Assets\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had $33.5 billion of net fixed assets, the most significant category of which was aircraft. In accounting for fixed assets, we make estimates of the expected useful lives and residual values. We evaluate the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based on our usage, maintenance and replacement policies, and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets. Our accounting policy for long-lived assets is set out in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nIn estimating the useful lives and expected residual values of aircraft, we consider actual experience with the same or similar aircraft types and future volume projections for our air products. Adverse changes in volume forecasts, or a shortfall in our actual volume compared with our projections, could result in our current aircraft capacity exceeding current or projected demand. This situation could lead to an excess of a particular aircraft, resulting in an impairment charge or a reduction of the expected useful life of an aircraft that may result in increased depreciation expense. Revisions to estimates of useful lives and residual values could also be caused by changes to our maintenance programs, governmental regulations on aging aircraft and changing market prices of new and used aircraft of the same or similar types. We periodically evaluate these estimates and assumptions, and adjust them as necessary. Adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis through depreciation expense.\nWe monitor our long-lived assets for indicators of impairment which may include, but are not limited to, a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset. If circumstances are present that indicate the carrying value of our long-lived assets may not be recoverable, we then perform impairment testing at the asset group level.\n50\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nAsset groups represent the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified. Determining the asset group requires judgment and changes in the way asset groups are defined could have material impact to the results of impairment testing. We perform recoverability testing by comparing the undiscounted cash flows of the asset group to the carrying value of the asset group. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. Details of long-lived asset impairments are included in note 5 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nFair Value Measurements\nIn the normal course of business, we hold and issue financial instruments that contain elements of market risk, including derivatives, marketable securities, finance receivables, pension assets, other investments and debt. Certain of these financial instruments are required to be recorded at fair value, principally derivatives, marketable securities, pension assets and certain other investments. These financial instruments are measured and reported at fair value on a recurring basis based upon a fair value hierarchy (Levels 1, 2 and 3). Fair values are based on listed market prices (Level 1), when such prices are available. To the extent that listed market prices are not available, fair value is determined based on other relevant factors, including dealer price quotations (Level 2). If listed market prices or other relevant factors are not available, inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability (Level 3). Certain financial instruments, including over-the-counter derivative instruments, are valued using pricing models that consider, among other factors, contractual and market prices, correlations, time value, credit spreads and yield curve volatility factors. Changes in the fixed income, foreign currency exchange and commodity markets will impact our estimates of fair value in the future, potentially affecting our results of operations. Further information on our accounting polices relating to fair value measurements can be found in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the majority of our financial instruments were categorized as either Level 1 or Level 2. Refer to notes 3, 10 and 18 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on these instruments. A quantitative sensitivity analysis of our exposure to changes in commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates is presented in the\nQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Market Risk\nsection of this report.\nWithin our pension assets, we hold investments in hedge, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate funds which are primarily measured using net asset value (\"NAV\") as a practical expedient for fair value, as appropriate. These investments were valued at $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2021. In order to estimate NAV, we evaluate audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers and make adjustments for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these assumptions. If our estimates of activity changed, this could have a material impact on the reported value of these investments and on the return on assets that we report. Refer to note 6 to the audited, consolidated financial statements for further information on our pension assets.\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment or when an asset or disposal group is classified as held for sale.\nIn accounting for business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values. Estimating the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed requires judgment, especially with respect to identified intangible assets as there may be limited or no observable transactions within the market, requiring us to develop internal models to estimate fair value. For example, estimating the fair value of identified intangible assets may require us to develop valuation assumptions, including but not limited to, future expected cash flows from identified intangible assets, synergies and the cost of capital. Certain inputs require us to determine assumptions that are reflective of a market participant view of fair value. Changes in any of these assumptions may materially impact the amount we recognize for identifiable assets and liabilities, in addition to the residual amount allocated to goodwill.\n51\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nIncome Taxes\nWe make certain estimates and judgments in determining income tax expense for financial statement purposes. These estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of income by legal entity and jurisdiction, tax credits, benefits and deductions, and in the calculation of deferred tax assets and liabilities, which arise from differences in the timing of recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial statement purposes, as well as tax, interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions. Significant changes to these estimates may result in an increase or decrease to our tax provision in a subsequent period.\nWe assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets. If recovery is not likely, we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable. We believe that we will ultimately recover a substantial majority of the deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheets. However, should there be a change in our ability to recover our deferred tax assets, our tax provision would increase in the period in which we determined that the recovery was not likely.\nThe calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations. We recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\n52\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

    "text": "We are exposed to market risk from changes in certain commodity prices, foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices. All of these market risks arise in the normal course of business, as we do not engage in speculative trading activities. In order to manage the risk arising from these exposures, we may utilize a variety of commodity, foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate forward contracts, options and swaps. A discussion of our accounting policy for derivative instruments is provided in note 1 to the audited, consolidated financial statements.\nCommodity Price Risk\nWe are exposed to changes in the prices of refined fuels, principally jet-A, diesel and unleaded gasoline, as well as changes in the price of natural gas and other alternative fuels. Currently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package services are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers, we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage services. The majority of our contracts for fuel purchases utilize index-based pricing formulas plus or minus a fixed locational/supplier differential. While many of the indices are aligned, each index may fluctuate at a different pace, driving variability in the prices paid for fuel. Because of this, our operating results may be affected should the market price of fuel suddenly change by a significant amount or change by amounts that do not result in an adjustment in our fuel surcharges, which can significantly affect our results either positively or negatively in the short-term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had no commodity contracts outstanding.\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\nWe have foreign currency risks related to our revenue, operating expenses and financing transactions in currencies other than the local currencies in which we operate. We are exposed to currency risk from the potential changes in functional currency values of our foreign currency-denominated assets, liabilities and cash flows. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar. We may use forward contracts as well as a combination of purchased and written options to hedge forecasted cash flow currency exposures. These derivative instruments generally cover forecasted foreign currency exposures for periods of 12 to 48 months. We also utilize forward contracts to hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement.\nInterest Rate Risk\nWe have issued debt instruments and debt associated with finance leases that accrue expense at fixed and floating rates of interest. We use interest rate swaps as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. The notional amount, interest payment and maturity dates of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt. We may also utilize forward starting swaps and similar instruments to lock in all or a portion of the borrowing cost of anticipated debt issuances. Our floating-rate debt and interest rate swaps subject us to risk resulting from changes in short-term interest rates.\nWe also are subject to interest rate risk with respect to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations, as changes in interest rates will effectively increase or decrease our liabilities associated with these benefit plans, which also results in changes to the amount of pension and postretirement benefit expense recognized in future periods.\nWe have investments in debt securities, as well as cash-equivalent instruments, some of which accrue income at variable rates of interest. Additionally, we hold a portfolio of finance receivables that accrue income at fixed and floating rates of interest.\nSensitivity Analysis\nThe following analysis provides quantitative information regarding our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk embedded in our existing financial instruments. We utilize valuation models to evaluate the sensitivity of the fair value of financial instruments with exposure to market risk that assume instantaneous, parallel shifts in exchange rates, interest rate yield curves and commodity and equity prices. For options and instruments with non-linear returns, models appropriate to the instrument are utilized to determine the impact of market shifts.\n53\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nMANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND\nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\nThere are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented, primarily due to the assumption that foreign currency exchange rates change in a parallel fashion and that interest rates change instantaneously. In addition, the analyses are unable to reflect the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled. While this is our best estimate of the impact of the specified interest rate scenarios, these estimates should not be viewed as forecasts. We adjust the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities in response to changes in market conditions. Additionally, changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives and commodity derivatives are offset by changes in the cash flows of the underlying hedged foreign currency and commodity transactions.\n(1)\nThe potential change in fair value from a hypothetical 10% weakening of the U.S. Dollar against local currency exchange rates across all maturities.\n(2)\nThe potential change in annual interest expense resulting from a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in short-term interest rates, applied to our variable rate debt and swap instruments (excluding hedges of anticipated debt issuances).\nThe sensitivity of our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to changes in interest rates is quantified in\nCritical Accounting Estimates\n.

In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report dated February 21, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal control over financial reporting.\nBasis for Opinion\nThese financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company's financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nCritical Audit Matters\nThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statements that were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosures that are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments. The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as a whole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical audit matters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.\n56\nValuation of U.S. hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments — Refer to Note 6, Company-Sponsored Employee Benefit Plans (Fair Value Measurements), to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nThe Company’s U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans (the “U.S. Plans”) held hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments valued at $9.6 billion as of December 31, 2021.\nThe Company determines the reported values of the U.S. Plans’ investments in hedge, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate funds primarily based on the estimated net asset value (“NAV”) of the fund.  In order to estimate NAV, the Company evaluates audited and unaudited financial reports from fund managers, and makes adjustments, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st.  These investments are not actively traded, and their values can only be estimated using these subjective assumptions.\nAuditing the estimated NAV of these hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments requires a high degree of auditor judgment and subjectivity to evaluate the completeness, reliability and relevance of the inputs used by management.\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the inputs used by management to estimate the NAV of the U.S. Plans’ hedge fund, risk parity, private debt, private equity and real estate investments included the following, among others:\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls, including those related to the reliability of values reported by fund managers, the relevance of asset class benchmark returns, and the completeness and accuracy of unobservable inputs related to the underlying assets of the funds.\n•\nFor certain investments, we confirmed directly with the respective fund manager its preliminary estimate of the fund’s NAV as of December 31, 2021.\n•\nFor certain investments, we inquired of management to understand year-over-year changes in the fund manager’s estimate of NAV and compared the fund’s return on investment to other available qualitative and quantitative information relevant to the fund.\n•\nWe evaluated the Company’s historical ability to accurately estimate NAV for these funds by comparing each fund’s recorded valuation as of its prior fiscal year end to the NAV per the audited fund financial statements (which are received in arrears of the Company’s reporting timetable).\nRevenue — Refer to Note 2, Revenue Recognition, to the financial statements\nCritical Audit Matter Description\nApproximately 82 percent of the Company’s revenues are from its global small package operations that provide time-definite delivery services for express letters, documents, small packages and palletized freight via air and ground services. The Company’s global small package revenues are comprised of a significant volume of low-dollar transactions sourced from systems that were primarily developed by the Company. The processing of transactions, including the recording of them, is highly automated and based on contractual terms with the Company’s customers.\nAuditing global small package revenue required a significant extent of effort and the involvement of professionals with expertise in information technology (“IT”) necessary for us to identify, test, and evaluate the Company’s systems, software applications and automated controls.\n57\nHow the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the Audit\nOur audit procedures related to the Company’s systems to process global small package revenue transactions included the following, among others:\n•\nWith the assistance of our IT specialists, we:\n–\nIdentified the significant systems used to process global small package revenue transactions and tested the effectiveness of the general IT controls over each of these systems, including testing of user access controls, change management controls, and IT operations controls.\n–\nTested the effectiveness of system interface controls and automated controls within the global small package revenue stream, as well as the controls designed to ensure the accuracy and completeness of revenue.\n•\nWe tested the effectiveness of controls over the relevant global small package revenue business processes, including those in place to reconcile the various systems to the Company’s general ledger.\n•\nWe performed analytical procedures to evaluate the Company’s recorded revenue and evaluate trends.\n•\nFor a sample of customers, we read the Company’s contract with the customer and evaluated the Company’s pattern of revenue recognition for the customer.  In addition, we evaluated the accuracy of the Company’s recorded global small package revenue for a sample of customer invoices.\n/s/\nDeloitte & Touche LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 21, 2022\nWe have served as the Company's auditor since 1969.\n58\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS\n(In millions)\nSee notes to audited, consolidated financial statements.\n59\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED INCOME\n(In millions, except per share amounts)\nSTATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)\n(In millions)\nSee notes to audited, consolidated financial statements.\n60\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nSTATEMENTS OF CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOWS\n(In millions)\nSee notes to audited, consolidated financial statements.\n61\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 1.\nSUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES\nBasis of Financial Statements and Business Activities\nThe accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (\"GAAP\"), and include the accounts of United Parcel Service, Inc., and all of its consolidated subsidiaries (collectively \"UPS\" or the \"Company\"). All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nWe provide transportation services, primarily domestic and international letter and package delivery. Through our Supply Chain Solutions subsidiaries, we are also a global provider of transportation, logistics and related services.\nUse of Estimates\nThe preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the reported amounts of revenues and expenses and the disclosure of contingencies. Estimates have been prepared on the basis of the most current and best information, and actual results could differ materially from those estimates. In particular, a number of estimates have been and will continue to be affected by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and its economic consequences remain uncertain, are changing and are difficult to predict. As a result, our accounting estimates and assumptions may change over time.\nRevenue Recognition\nUnited States (\"U.S.\") Domestic and International Package Operations:\nRevenue is recognized over time as we perform the services in the contract.\nForwarding:\nFreight forwarding revenue and the expense related to the transportation of freight are recognized over time as we perform the services. Truckload brokerage revenue and related transportation costs are recognized over time as we perform the services. Customs brokerage revenue is recognized upon completing documents necessary for customs entry purposes.\nLogistics & Distribution:\nIn our Logistics & Distribution business we have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date, and as such we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.\nUPS Freight:\nPrior to divestiture,\nrevenue was recognized over time as we performed the services in the contract. Refer to note 4 for discussion of the divestiture.\nFinancial Services:\nIncome on loans and direct finance leases is recognized on the effective interest method. Accrual of interest income is suspended at the earlier of the time at which collection of an account becomes doubtful or the account becomes 90 days delinquent. Income on operating leases is recognized on the straight-line method over the terms of the underlying leases.\nRefer to note 2 for further discussion of our revenue recognition policies.\nCash and Cash Equivalents\nCash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash. We consider securities with maturities of three months or less, when purchased, to be cash equivalents. The carrying amount of these securities approximates fair value because of the short-term maturity of these instruments.\n62\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestments\nDebt securities are either classified as trading or available-for-sale securities and are carried at fair value. Unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are reported as\nInvestment income (expense) and other\non the statements of consolidated income. Unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are reported as other comprehensive income, a separate component of shareowners’ equity. The amortized cost of debt securities is adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts to maturity. Such amortization and accretion is included in\nInvestment income (expense) and other\n, along with interest and dividends. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific identification method; realized gains and losses resulting from such sales are included in\nInvestment income (expense) and other\n.\nWe periodically review our available-for-sale investments for indications of other-than-temporary impairment considering many factors, including the extent and duration to which a security’s fair value has been less than its cost, overall economic and market conditions and the financial condition and specific prospects for the issuer. Impairment of available-for-sale securities results in a charge to income when a market decline below cost is other-than-temporary.\nInventories\nFuel and other materials and supplies inventories are recognized as inventory when purchased, and then charged to expense when used in our operations. Jet fuel, diesel and unleaded gasoline inventories are valued at the lower of average cost or net realizable value. Total inventories were $\n717\nand $\n620\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, and are included in\nOther current assets\nin the consolidated balance sheets.\nProperty, Plant and Equipment\nProperty, plant and equipment are carried at cost. We evaluate the useful lives of our property, plant and equipment based on our usage, maintenance and replacement policies, and taking into account physical and economic factors that may affect the useful lives of the assets.\nDepreciation and amortization are provided by the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are as follows:\n•\nAircraft:\n7\nto\n40\nyears, based on aircraft type and original aircraft manufacture date\n•\nBuildings:\n10\nto\n40\nyears\n•\nLeasehold Improvements: lesser of asset useful life or lease term\n•\nPlant Equipment:\n3\nto\n20\nyears\n•\nTechnology Equipment:\n3\nto\n10\nyears\n•\nVehicles:\n5\nto\n15\nyears\nFor substantially all of our aircraft, the costs of major airframe and engine overhauls, as well as routine maintenance and repairs, are charged to expense as incurred.\nInterest incurred during the construction period of certain property, plant and equipment is capitalized until the underlying assets are placed in service, at which time amortization of the capitalized interest begins, straight-line, over the estimated useful lives of the related assets. Capitalized interest was $\n58\nand $\n87\nmillion for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\nWe review long-lived assets for impairment when circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable based on its undiscounted future cash flows. If the carrying amount of the asset is determined not to be recoverable, a write-down to fair value is recorded. Fair values are determined based on quoted market values, discounted cash flows or external appraisals, as appropriate. We test long-lived assets for impairment at the asset group level, which is the lowest level at which independent cash flows can be identified. Refer to note 5 for a discussion of impairments of property, plant and equipment recognized during the year.\nLeased Assets\nFor a discussion of our accounting policies related to leased assets, refer to note 12.\n63\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGoodwill and Intangible Assets\nCosts of purchased businesses in excess of net identifiable assets acquired (goodwill) and indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment at least annually, unless changes in circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred sooner. We are required to test goodwill on a reporting unit basis and we complete our annual goodwill impairment evaluation as of July 1st.\nIn assessing goodwill for impairment, we initially evaluate qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. We consider several factors, including macroeconomic conditions, industry and market conditions, overall financial performance of the reporting unit, changes in management, strategy or customers and relevant reporting unit-specific events such as a change in the carrying amount of net assets, a more likely than not expectation of selling or disposing of all, or a portion of, a reporting unit, and the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit. If this qualitative assessment results in a conclusion that it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds the carrying value, then no further testing is performed for that reporting unit.\nIf the qualitative assessment is not conclusive, we quantitatively assess the fair value of a reporting unit to test goodwill for impairment. We assess the fair value of a reporting unit using a combination of discounted cash flow modeling and observable valuation multiples for comparable companies. If the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value, we record the excess amount as goodwill impairment, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to the reporting unit.\nWhen performing impairment tests of indefinite-lived intangible assets, the estimated fair value is compared to the carrying value of the asset. If the carrying value of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value, an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value.\nFinite-lived intangible assets, including trademarks, licenses, patents, customer lists, non-compete agreements and franchise rights are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which range from\n2\nto\n22\nyears. Capitalized software is generally amortized over\n7\nyears.\nAssets Held for Sale\nWe classify long-lived assets or disposal groups as held for sale in the period when all of the following conditions have been met:\n•\nwe have approved and committed to a plan to sell the assets or disposal group;\n•\nthe asset or disposal group is available for immediate sale in its present condition;\n•\nan active program to locate a buyer and other actions required to complete the sale have been initiated;\n•\nthe sale of the asset or disposal group is probable and expected to be completed within one year;\n•\nthe asset or disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value; and\n•\nit is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn.\nWe initially measure a long-lived asset or disposal group that is classified as held for sale at the lower of its carrying value or fair value less any costs to sell and recognize any loss in the period in which the held for sale criteria are met. Gains are not recognized until the date of sale. We cease depreciation and amortization of a long-lived asset, or assets within a disposal group, upon their designation as held for sale and subsequently assess fair value less any costs to sell at each reporting period until the asset or disposal group is no longer classified as held for sale.\nSelf-Insurance Accruals\nWe self-insure costs associated with workers’ compensation claims, automobile liability, health and welfare and general business liabilities, up to certain limits. Self-insurance reserves are established for estimates of the loss that we will ultimately incur on reported claims, as well as estimates of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported. The expected ultimate cost for claims incurred is estimated based upon historical loss experience and judgments about the present and expected levels of cost per claim. Trends in actual experience are a significant factor in the determination of our reserves.\n64\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWorkers’ compensation, automobile liability and general liability insurance claims may take several years to completely resolve. Consequently, actuarial estimates are required to project the ultimate cost that will be incurred to fully resolve a claim. Several factors can affect the actual cost, or severity, of a claim, including the length of time the claim remains open, trends in healthcare costs, the results of any related litigation and changes in legislation. Furthermore, claims may emerge in a future year for events that occurred in a prior year at a rate that differs from actuarial projections. All these factors can result in revisions to actuarial projections and produce a material difference between estimated and actual operating results. We believe our estimated reserves for such claims are adequate, but actual experience in claim frequency and/or severity could materially differ from our estimates and affect our results of operations.\nWe also sponsor a number of health and welfare insurance plans for our employees. Liabilities and expenses related to these plans are based on estimates of the number of employees and eligible dependents covered under the plans, global health events, anticipated medical usage by participants and overall trends in medical costs and inflation.\nPension and Postretirement Benefits\nWe incur certain employment-related expenses associated with pension and postretirement medical benefits. These pension and postretirement medical benefit costs for company-sponsored defined benefit plans are calculated using various actuarial assumptions and methodologies, including discount rates, expected returns on plan assets, healthcare cost trend rates, inflation, compensation increase rates, mortality rates and coordination of benefits with plans not sponsored by UPS. Actuarial assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis, unless circumstances require an interim remeasurement of any of our plans.\nWe recognize changes in the fair value of plan assets and net actuarial gains or losses in excess of a corridor (defined as\n10\n% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets or the plan's projected benefit obligation) in\nInvestment income (expense) and other\nupon remeasurement of a plan. The remaining components of pension expense, primarily service and interest costs and the expected return on plan assets, are recorded ratably on a quarterly basis.\nWe recognize expense for required contributions to defined contribution plans quarterly, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid within\nAccrued group welfare and retirement plan contributions\n.\nWe participate in a number of trustee-managed multiemployer pension and health and welfare plans for employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. Our contributions to these plans are determined in accordance with the respective collective bargaining agreements. We recognize expense for the contractually required contribution for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid within\nAccrued group welfare and retirement plan contributions\n.\nIncome Taxes\nIncome taxes are accounted for on an asset and liability approach that requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns. In estimating future tax consequences, we generally consider all expected future events other than proposed changes in the tax law or rates. Valuation allowances are provided if it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized. Our current accounting policy for releasing income tax effects from other comprehensive income is based on a portfolio approach.\nWe recognize liabilities for uncertain tax positions based on a two-step process. The first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit, including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes, if any. Once it is determined that the position meets the recognition threshold, the second step requires us to estimate and measure the largest amount of tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized upon ultimate settlement. The difference between the amount of recognizable tax benefit and the total amount of tax benefit from positions filed or to be filed with the tax authorities is recorded as a liability for uncertain tax benefits. It is inherently difficult and subjective to estimate such amounts, as we have to determine the probability of various possible outcomes. We reevaluate uncertain tax positions on a quarterly basis. This evaluation is based on factors including, but not limited to, changes in facts or circumstances, changes in tax law, effectively settled issues under audit and new audit activity. Such a change in recognition or measurement could result in the recognition of a tax benefit or an additional charge to the tax provision.\n65\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nForeign Currency Translation and Remeasurement\nWe translate the results of operations of our foreign subsidiaries using average exchange rates during each period, whereas balance sheet accounts are translated using exchange rates at the end of each period. Balance sheet currency translation adjustments are recorded in other comprehensive income. Pre-tax foreign currency transaction gains (losses) from remeasurement, net of hedging, included in\nInvestment income (expense) and other\nwere $(\n36\n), $\n9\nand $(\n6\n) million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nStock-Based Compensation\nAll share-based awards to employees are measured based on their fair values and expensed over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award (the vesting period), less estimated forfeitures. We have issued employee share-based awards under various incentive compensation plans that contain vesting conditions, including service conditions, where the awards cliff vest or vest ratably over a one, three, or five year period (the \"nominal vesting period\") or at the date the employee retires (as defined by the plan), if earlier. Compensation cost is generally recognized immediately for awards granted to retirement-eligible employees, or over the period from the grant date to the date retirement eligibility is achieved, if that is expected to occur during the nominal vesting period. We estimate forfeiture rates based on historical rates of forfeitures for awards with similar characteristics, historical and projected rates of employee turnover and the nature and terms of the vesting conditions of the awards. We reevaluate our forfeiture rates on an annual basis.\nFair Value Measurements\nOur financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy. Level 1 inputs utilize quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 inputs are based on other observable market data, such as quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities, and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rates and yield curves. Level 3 inputs are developed from unobservable data reflecting our own assumptions, and include situations where there is little or no market activity for the asset or liability.\nCertain non-financial assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis, including property, plant, and equipment, goodwill and intangible assets. These assets are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances, such as when there is evidence of an impairment. A general description of the valuation methodologies used for assets and liabilities measured at fair value, including the general classification of such assets and liabilities pursuant to the valuation hierarchy, is included in each footnote with fair value measurements present.\nFor business acquisitions, we allocate the fair value of purchase consideration to the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values. The excess of the fair value of purchase consideration over the fair values of these identifiable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. During the measurement period, which is one year from the acquisition date, we may record adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset to goodwill. Following the conclusion of the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded to earnings.\nDerivative Instruments\nWe recognize all derivative instruments as assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether it has been designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For those derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as hedging instruments, we designate the derivative as a cash flow hedge, a fair value hedge or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation based upon the exposure being hedged.\nA cash flow hedge refers to hedging the exposure to variability in expected future cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of other comprehensive income, and reclassified into earnings in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings.\nA fair value hedge refers to hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of an existing asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk. For derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is recognized during the current period, as well as the offsetting gain or loss on the hedged item.\n66\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nA net investment hedge refers to the use of cross currency swaps, forward contracts or foreign currency denominated debt to hedge portions of net investments in foreign operations. For instruments that meet the hedge accounting requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in the foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income, and are recorded in the income statement when the hedged item affects earnings.\nAdoption of New Accounting Standards\nIn June 2016, the FASB issued an ASU introducing an expected credit loss methodology for the measurement of financial assets not accounted for at fair value. The methodology replaced the probable, incurred loss model for those assets. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020 by updating our process for calculating our allowance for credit losses to include reasonable and supportable forecasts that could affect expected collectability. As of December 31, 2021, we decreased our allowance for credit losses by $\n10\nmillion, primarily based upon improvements in customer collections.\nIn January 2017, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for goodwill impairment by eliminating the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill using a hypothetical purchase price allocation. Under this ASU, goodwill impairment is the amount by which a reporting unit’s carrying value exceeds its fair value, not to exceed the carrying amount of goodwill. We adopted this standard on January 1, 2020, applying the simplified approach to calculate the goodwill impairment charge of $\n494\nmillion that we recorded in 2020 in conjunction with the divestiture of UPS Freight.\nIn December 2019, the FASB issued an ASU to simplify the accounting for income taxes. The update removes certain exceptions to the general income tax principles. Effective October 1, 2020, we early adopted this ASU. It did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nIn March 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-04, Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848), to temporarily ease the potential burden in accounting for reference rate reform. The standard provides optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to contracts, hedging relationships and other transactions affected by reference rate reform. The guidance was effective upon issuance and at present can generally be applied through December 31, 2022. We are evaluating the potential impacts of reference rate reform on our various contractual positions to determine whether we may apply any of the practical expedients set forth in this standard; however, we do not expect reference rate reform to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nOther accounting pronouncements adopted during the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\nAccounting Standards Issued But Not Yet Effective\nAccounting pronouncements issued, but not effective until after December 31, 2021, are not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position, results of operations or cash flows.\n67\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 2.\nREVENUE RECOGNITION\nRevenue Recognition\nSubstantially all of our revenues are from contracts associated with the pickup, transportation and delivery of packages and freight (“transportation services”) domestically and internationally. These services may be carried out by or arranged by us and generally occur over a short period of time. Additionally, we provide value-added logistics services to customers, both domestically and internationally, through our global network of company-owned and leased distribution centers and field stocking locations.\nDisaggregation of Revenue\nWe account for a contract when both parties have approved the contract and are committed to perform their obligations, the rights of the parties are identified, payment terms are identified, the contract has commercial substance and collectability of consideration is probable.\nPerformance Obligations\nA performance obligation is a promise in a contract to transfer a distinct good or service to the customer, and is the basis of revenue recognition in accordance with GAAP. To determine the proper revenue recognition method for contracts, we evaluate whether two or more contracts should be combined and accounted for as a single contract, and whether the combined or single contract should be accounted for as more than one performance obligation. This evaluation requires judgment, and the decision to combine a group of contracts or separate the combined or single contract into multiple performance obligations could change the amount of revenue and profit recorded in a given period. Within most of our contracts, the customer contracts with us to provide distinct services, such as transportation services. The vast majority of our contracts with customers for transportation services include only one performance obligation; the transportation services themselves. However, if a contract is separated into more than one performance obligation, we allocate the total transaction price to each performance obligation based on the estimated relative standalone selling prices of the promised goods or services underlying each performance obligation. We frequently sell standard transportation services with observable standalone sales prices. In these instances, the observable standalone sales are used to determine the standalone selling price.\n68\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn certain business units, such as Logistics, we sell customized, customer-specific solutions in which we integrate a complex set of tasks and components into a single capability (even if that single capability results in the delivery of multiple units). Hence, the entire contract is accounted for as one performance obligation. In these cases we typically use the expected cost plus a margin approach to estimate the standalone selling price of each performance obligation.\nSatisfaction of Performance Obligations\nWe generally recognize revenue over time as we perform the services in the contract because of the continuous transfer of control to the customer. Our customers receive the benefit of our services as the goods are transported from one location to another. Further, if we were unable to complete delivery to the final location, another entity would not need to reperform the transportation service already performed.\nAs control transfers over time, revenue is recognized based on the extent of progress towards completion of the performance obligation. The selection of the method to measure progress towards completion requires judgment and is based on the nature of the products or services to be provided. We use the cost-to-cost measure of progress for our package delivery contracts because it best depicts the transfer of control to the customer which occurs as we incur costs on our contracts. Under the cost-to-cost measure of progress, the extent of progress towards completion is measured based on the ratio of costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs at completion of the performance obligation. Revenues, including ancillary or accessorial fees and reductions for estimated customer incentives, are recorded proportionally as costs are incurred. Costs to fulfill include labor and other direct costs and an allocation of indirect costs. For our freight forwarding contracts, an output method of progress based on time-in-transit is utilized as the timing of costs incurred does not best depict the transfer of control to the customer. In our Logistics business we have a right to consideration from customers in an amount that corresponds directly with the value to the customers of our performance completed to date; therefore we recognize revenue in the amount to which we have a right to invoice the customer.\nVariable Consideration\nIt is common for our contracts to contain customer incentives, guaranteed service refunds or other provisions that can either increase or decrease the transaction price. These variable amounts are generally dependent upon achievement of certain incentive tiers or performance metrics. We estimate variable consideration at the most likely amount to which we expect to be entitled. We include estimated amounts of revenue, which may be reduced by incentives or other contract provisions, in the transaction price to the extent it is probable that a significant reversal of cumulative revenue recognized will not occur when the uncertainty associated with the variable consideration is resolved. Our estimates of variable consideration and determination of whether to include estimated amounts in the transaction price are based on an assessment of anticipated customer spending and all information (historical, current and forecasted) that is reasonably available to us.\nContract Modifications\nContracts are often modified to account for changes in the rates we charge our customers or to add additional, distinct services. We consider contract modifications to exist when the modification either creates new, or changes the existing, enforceable rights and obligations. Contract modifications that add distinct goods or services are treated as separate contracts. Contract modifications that do not add distinct goods or services typically change the price of existing services. These contract modifications are accounted for prospectively as the remaining performance obligations are distinct.\nPayment Terms\nUnder the typical payment terms of our customer contracts, the customer pays at periodic intervals, which are generally seven days within our U.S. Domestic Package business, for shipments included on invoices received. Invoices are generated each week on the week-ending day, which is Saturday for the majority of our U.S. Domestic Package business, but could be another day depending on the business unit or the specific agreement with the customer. It is not customary business practice to extend payment terms past 90 days, and as such, we do not have a practice of including a significant financing component within our contracts with customers.\n69\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nPrincipal vs. Agent Considerations\nIn our transportation businesses, we utilize independent contractors and third-party carriers in the performance of some transportation services. GAAP requires us to evaluate, using a control model, whether our businesses themselves promise to transfer services to the customer (as the principal) or to arrange for services to be provided by another party (as an agent). Based on our evaluation of the control model, we determined that all of our major businesses act as the principal rather than an agent within their revenue arrangements. Revenue and the associated purchased transportation costs are both reported on a gross basis within our statements of consolidated income.\nAccounts Receivable, Net\nAccounts receivable, net\n, include amounts billed and currently due from customers. The amounts due are stated at their net estimated realizable value. Losses on accounts receivable are recognized when reasonable and supportable forecasts affect the expected collectability. This requires us to make our best estimate of the current expected losses inherent in our accounts receivable at each balance sheet date. These estimates require consideration of historical loss experience, adjusted for current conditions, forward-looking indicators, trends in customer payment frequency, and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data, including present and future economic conditions and the financial health of specific customers and market sectors. Our risk management process includes standards and policies for reviewing major account exposures and concentrations of risk.\nWe decreased our allowance for expected credit losses by $\n10\nmillion during 2021 based upon current forecasts that reflect changes in the economic outlook. Our allowance for credit losses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n128\nand $\n138\nmillion, respectively. Amounts for credit losses charged to expense before recoveries during the twelve months ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 were $\n175\nand $\n254\nmillion, respectively.\nContract Assets and Liabilities\nContract assets include billed and unbilled amounts resulting from in-transit packages, as we have an unconditional right to payment only once all performance obligations have been completed (i.e., packages have been delivered) and our right to payment is not solely based on the passage of time. Amounts may not exceed their net realizable value. Contract assets are generally classified as current and the full balance is converted each quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions.\nContract liabilities consist of advance payments and billings in excess of revenue as well as deferred revenue. Advance payments and billings in excess of revenue represent payments received from our customers that will be earned over the contract term. Deferred revenue represents the amount of consideration due from customers related to in-transit shipments that has not yet been recognized as revenue based on our selected measure of progress. We classify advance payments and billings in excess of revenue as either current or long-term, depending on the period over which the advance payment will be earned. We classify deferred revenue as current based on the timing of when we expect to recognize revenue, which typically occurs within a short window after period-end. The full balance of deferred revenue is converted each quarter based on the short-term nature of the transactions. Our contract assets and liabilities are reported in a net position on a contract-by-contract basis at the end of each reporting period. In order to determine revenue recognized in the period from contract liabilities, we first allocate revenue to the individual contract liability balance outstanding at the beginning of the period until the revenue exceeds that deferred revenue balance.\nContract assets related to in-transit packages were $\n304\nand $\n279\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, net of deferred revenue related to in-transit packages of $\n314\nand $\n279\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Contract assets are included within\nOther current assets\nin the consolidated balance sheets. Short-term contract liabilities related to advance payments from customers were $\n27\nand $\n21\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Short-term contract liabilities are included within\nOther current liabilities\nin the consolidated balance sheets. Long-term contract liabilities related to advance payments from customers were $\n25\nand $\n26\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Long-term contract liabilities are included within\nOther Non-Current Liabilities\nin the consolidated balance sheets.\n70\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

The gross realized losses on sales of available-for-sale marketable securities totaled $\n2\n, $\n0\nand $\n2\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nThere were\nno\nmaterial impairment losses recognized on marketable securities during 2021, 2020 or 2019.\n71\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInvestment Impairments\nWe have concluded that\nno\nmaterial impairment losses existed as of December 31, 2021. In making this determination, we considered the financial condition and prospects of each issuer, the magnitude of the losses compared with the cost, the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security, the credit rating of the security and our ability and intent to hold these investments until the anticipated recovery in market value occurs.\nUnrealized Losses\nThe following table presents the age of gross unrealized losses and fair value by investment category for all securities in a loss position as of December 31, 2021 (in millions):\nThe unrealized losses for the U.S. government and agency debt securities are primarily due to changes in market interest rates. We have both the intent and ability to hold these securities for the time necessary to recover the cost basis.\nMaturity Information\nThe amortized cost and estimated fair value of marketable securities as of December 31, 2021, by contractual maturity, are shown below (in millions). Actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations with or without prepayment penalties.\nNon-Current Investments and Restricted Cash\nWe hold an investment in a variable life insurance policy to fund benefits for the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan. The investment had a fair market value of $\n23\nmillion as of both December 31, 2021 and 2020. Changes in investment fair value are recognized in\nInvestment income (expense) and other\nin the statements of consolidated income. Additionally, we held cash in escrow related to the acquisition and disposition of certain assets of $\n3\nand $\n2\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. These amounts are classified as\nInvestments and Restricted Cash\nin the consolidated balance sheets.\nA reconciliation of cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash from the consolidated balance sheets to the statements of consolidated cash flows is shown below (in millions):\n72\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

Marketable securities valued utilizing Level 2 inputs include asset-backed securities, corporate bonds and municipal bonds. These securities are valued using market corroborated pricing, matrix pricing or other models that utilize observable inputs such as yield curves.\nThe following table presents information about our investments measured at fair value on a recurring basis as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and indicates the fair value hierarchy of the valuation techniques utilized to determine such fair value (in millions):\nThere were no material transfers of investments between Level 1 and Level 2 during 2021 or 2020.\n73\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 4.\nASSETS HELD FOR SALE\nAs previously disclosed, on January 24, 2021, we entered into an agreement to divest our UPS Freight business to TFI International Inc. for $\n800\nmillion, subject to working capital and other adjustments.\nAs of December 31, 2020, we classified UPS Freight as held for sale and, as a result, recognized a total pre-tax impairment charge of $\n686\nmillion ($\n629\nmillion after tax), comprised of a goodwill impairment charge of $\n494\nmillion and a valuation allowance of $\n192\nmillion to adjust the carrying value of the disposal group to fair value less cost to sell. As of March 31, 2021, we increased the valuation allowance by $\n66\nmillion ($\n50\nmillion after tax) to adjust the carrying value of the disposal group to our revised estimate of fair value less cost to sell.\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture for cash proceeds of $\n848\nmillion, which included our estimate of working capital and other adjustments. Self-insurance reserves for UPS Freight and obligations for benefits earned within UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans were retained by us. In connection with the completion of the divestiture, we remeasured and amended certain of our company-sponsored U.S. pension and postretirement medical benefit plans, resulting in a $\n2.1\nbillion reduction in the obligations included in our consolidated balance sheet. Also in connection with the completion of the divestiture, we recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n101\nmillion ($\n77\nmillion after tax), which included the impact of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments.\nFor the twelve months ended December 31, 2021, we recorded a net pre-tax gain of $\n46\nmillion ($\n35\nmillion after tax). The activity was recognized within\nOther expenses\nin the statements of consolidated income.\nUPS and TFI also entered into an agreement for UPS Freight to continue to utilize our U.S. Domestic Package network to fulfill shipments for an initial period of five years. UPS also agreed to provide certain other services to TFI for a transitional period. We recognize our performance under commercial agreements as revenue in the statements of consolidated income, with the associated expenses presented in the respective line items of operating expenses.\nThe following table summarizes the carrying values of the assets and liabilities classified as held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n74\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

Additionally, we monitor all other property, plant and equipment categories for any indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We recognized impairment charges of $\n71\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021, due to the reevaluation of certain facility projects. There were\nno\nmaterial impairment charges during the year ended December 31, 2020.\n75\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 6.\nCOMPANY-SPONSORED EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nWe sponsor various retirement and pension plans, including defined benefit and defined contribution plans which cover our employees worldwide.\nU.S. Pension Benefits\nIn the U.S. we maintain the following single-employer defined benefit pension plans: the UPS Retirement Plan, the UPS Pension Plan, the UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan, a non-qualified plan.\nThe UPS Retirement Plan is noncontributory and includes substantially all eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries hired prior to July 1, 2016 who are not members of a collective bargaining unit, as well as certain employees covered by a collective bargaining agreement. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on average compensation earned by employees prior to retirement. Benefits payable under this plan are subject to maximum compensation limits and the annual benefit limits for a tax-qualified defined benefit plan as prescribed by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”).\nThe UPS Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes certain eligible employees of participating domestic subsidiaries and members of collective bargaining units that elect to participate in the plan. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\nThe UPS/IBT Full-Time Employee Pension Plan is noncontributory and includes employees that were previously members of the Central States Pension Fund (\"CSPF\"), a multiemployer pension plan, in addition to other eligible employees who are covered under certain collective bargaining agreements. This plan generally provides for retirement benefits based on service credits earned by employees prior to retirement.\nThe UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS Retirement Plan, hired prior to July 1, 2016, for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above.\nThe UPS Retirement Plan and the UPS Excess Coordinating Benefit Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for non-union participants effective January 1, 2023.\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2019, certain former U.S. employees were offered the option to receive a one-time payment of their vested pension benefit. Approximately\n18,800\nformer employees accepted this option, accelerating $\n820\nmillion in benefit payments during 2019 while reducing the number of participants who are due future payments from U.S. pension plans. As the cost of these settlements did not exceed the plans' service cost and interest cost for the year, the impact of the settlement was not recognized in earnings.\nOn April 30, 2021, we completed the divestiture of UPS Freight as discussed in note 4. The divestiture triggered an interim remeasurement of certain UPS-sponsored pension and postretirement medical benefit plans under Accounting Standards Codification Topic 715- Compensation- Retirement Benefits (“ASC 715”). Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and benefit obligations of the UPS Pension Plan, UPS Retirement Plan and UPS Retired Employee Health Care Plan as of April 30, 2021.\nThe interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $\n2.1\nbillion. The actuarial gain reflects a $\n3.7\nbillion benefit from a\n49\nbasis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020 and a $\n0.1\nbillion benefit related to workforce reductions associated with the divestiture, offset by a $\n1.7\nbillion loss resulting from actual returns being approximately\n430\nbasis points below expected returns. The $\n2.1\nbillion actuarial gain was recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income (\"AOCI\") within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. A pre-tax actuarial gain of $\n69\nmillion ($\n52\nmillion after tax) was immediately recognized for a prior service credit related to the divested group in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter. We also amended certain benefit terms within these plans as of April 30, 2021. The amendment to the UPS Pension Plan resulted in the immediate recognition of a $\n66\nmillion ($\n50\nmillion after tax) loss in the statement of consolidated income for the second quarter.\nThe impacts of the plan remeasurements and plan amendments are included within\nOther expenses\nin the statements of consolidated income as components of the divestiture of UPS Freight.\n76\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nInternational Pension Benefits\nWe also sponsor various defined benefit plans covering certain of our international employees. The majority of our international obligations are for defined benefit plans in Canada and the United Kingdom. In addition, many of our international employees are covered by government-sponsored retirement and pension plans. We are not directly responsible for providing benefits to participants of government-sponsored plans.\nU.S. Postretirement Medical Benefits\nWe also sponsor postretirement medical plans in the U.S. that provide healthcare benefits to our non-union retirees, as well as select union retirees who meet certain eligibility requirements and who are not otherwise covered by multiemployer plans. Generally, this includes employees with at least\n10\nyears of service who have reached age\n55\nand employees who are eligible for postretirement medical benefits from a Company-sponsored plan pursuant to collective bargaining agreements. We have the right to modify or terminate certain of these plans. These benefits have been provided to certain retirees on a noncontributory basis; however, in many cases, retirees are required to contribute all or a portion of the total cost of the coverage.\nDefined Contribution Plans\nWe sponsor a defined contribution plan for employees not covered under collective bargaining agreements, and several smaller defined contribution plans for certain employees covered under collective bargaining agreements. We match, in shares of UPS common stock or cash, a portion of the participating employees’ contributions. Matching contributions charged to expense were\n$\n153\n, $\n139\nand $\n130\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nIn addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, non-union employees hired after July 1, 2016, receive a retirement contribution. UPS contributes\n3\n% to\n8\n% of eligible pay to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service and business unit. Contributions under this plan are subject to maximum compensation and contribution limits for a tax-qualified defined contribution plan as prescribed by the IRS. The UPS Restoration Savings Plan is a non-qualified plan that provides benefits to certain participants in the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan for amounts that exceed the benefit limits described above. Contributions charged to expense were\n$\n107\n, $\n84\nand $\n67\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019 respectively.\nOn June 23, 2017, the Company amended the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan so that non-union employees who currently participate in the UPS Retirement Plan will, in addition to current benefits under the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan, earn a retirement contribution beginning January 1, 2023. UPS will contribute\n5\n% to\n8\n% of eligible compensation to the UPS 401(k) Savings Plan based on years of vesting service. The amendment also provides for transition contributions for certain participants. There was\nno\nimpact to the statements of consolidated income for 2021, 2020 and 2019 as a result of this change.\nContributions are also made to defined contribution money purchase plans under certain collective bargaining agreements. Amounts charged to expense were\n$\n112\n, $\n107\nand $\n97\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nNet Periodic Benefit Cost\nInformation about net periodic benefit cost for the company-sponsored pension and postretirement defined benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\n77\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nActuarial Assumptions\nThe table below provides the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the net periodic benefit cost:\nThe table below provides the weighted-average actuarial assumptions used to determine the benefit obligations of our plans:\nA discount rate is used to determine the present value of our future benefit obligations. To determine the discount rate for our U.S. pension and postretirement benefit plans, we use a bond matching approach to select specific bonds that would satisfy our projected benefit payments. We believe the bond matching approach reflects the process we would employ to settle our pension and postretirement benefit obligations. For our international plans, the discount rate is determined by matching the expected cash flows of the plan, where available, or of a sample plan of similar duration, to a yield curve based on long-term, high quality fixed income debt instruments available as of the measurement date. These assumptions are updated each measurement date, which is typically annually.\nAs of December 31, 2021, the impact of each basis point change in the discount rate on the projected benefit obligation of our pension and postretirement medical benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\nThe Society of Actuaries (\"SOA\") published mortality tables and improvement scales are used in developing the best estimate of mortality for our U.S. plans. In October 2021, the SOA published an updated improvement scale which slightly increased expected mortality improvements from previously published improvement scales. Based on our perspective of future longevity, we updated the mortality assumptions to incorporate the improvement scale for purposes of measuring pension and other postretirement benefit obligations.\nAssumptions for the expected return on plan assets are used to determine a component of net periodic benefit cost for the year. The assumption for our U.S. plans is developed using a long-term projection of returns for each asset class. Our asset allocation targets are reviewed and, if necessary, updated taking into consideration plan changes, funded status and actual performance. The expected return for each asset class is a function of passive, long-term capital market assumptions and excess returns generated from active management. The capital market assumptions used are provided by independent investment advisors, while excess return assumptions are supported by historical performance, fund mandates and investment expectations.\nFor plans outside the U.S., consideration is given to local market expectations of long-term returns. Strategic asset allocations are determined by plan, based on the nature of liabilities and considering the demographic composition of the plan participants.\n78\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nActuarial Assumptions - Central States Pension Fund\nUPS was a contributing employer to the CSPF until 2007 at which time UPS withdrew from the CSPF and paid a $\n6.1\nbillion withdrawal liability to satisfy our allocable share of unfunded vested benefits. Under a collective bargaining agreement with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters (“IBT”), UPS agreed to provide coordinating benefits in the UPS/IBT Full Time Employee Pension Plan (“UPS/IBT Plan”) for UPS participants whose last employer was UPS and who had not retired as of January 1, 2008 (“the UPS Transfer Group”) in the event that benefits are lawfully reduced by the CSPF in the future consistent with the terms of our withdrawal agreement with the CSPF.\nUnder this withdrawal agreement, benefits to the UPS Transfer Group cannot be reduced without our consent and can only be reduced in accordance with applicable law. The financial crisis of 2008 created extensive asset losses at the CSPF, contributing to the plan’s projected insolvency, at which time benefits would be reduced to the legally permitted Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (\"PBGC\") limits, triggering the coordination of benefits provision in the collective bargaining agreement.\nIn 2014, Congress passed the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act (“MPRA”). This change in law for the first time permitted multiemployer pension plans to reduce benefit payments to retirees, subject to specific guidelines in the statute and government approval. In 2015, the CSPF submitted a proposed pension benefit reduction plan to the U.S. Department of the Treasury (“Treasury”). In 2016, Treasury rejected the proposed plan submitted by the CSPF.\nIn light of its financial difficulties, the CSPF stated that it believed a legislative solution to its funded status would be necessary or that it would become insolvent in 2025, at which time benefits would be reduced to the applicable PBGC benefit levels.\nWe account for the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits to the UPS Transfer Group under ASC 715, which requires us to provide a best estimate of various actuarial assumptions, including the eventual outcome of this matter, in measuring our pension benefit obligation at the December 31st measurement date and at interim periods when a significant event occurs. ASC 715 does not permit anticipation of changes in law when developing a best estimate.\nAt the December 31, 2020 measurement date, we developed our best estimate for the potential obligation to pay coordinating benefits to the UPS Transfer Group using a deterministic cash flow projection that reflected estimated CSPF cash flows and investment earnings, the lack of legislative action having been taken, the expectation of payment of guaranteed benefits by the PBGC and the lack of a benefit reduction plan under MPRA having been filed by the CSPF. As a result, our best estimate at that time of the obligation for coordinating benefits that may have been required to be directly provided by the UPS/IBT Plan to the UPS Transfer Group was $\n5.5\nbillion.\nIn March 2021, the American Rescue Plan Act (“ARPA”) was enacted into law. The ARPA contains provisions that allow for qualifying financially distressed multiemployer pension plans to apply for special financial assistance (\"SFA\") from the PBGC, which will be funded by Treasury. Following approval of an application, a qualifying multiemployer pension plan will receive a lump sum payment to enable it to continue paying unreduced benefits through 2051. The multiemployer plan is not obligated to repay the SFA. The ARPA is intended to prevent both the PBGC and certain financially distressed multiemployer pension plans, including the CSPF, from becoming insolvent through 2051. On July 9, 2021, the PBGC issued interim final regulations implementing the SFA program established under the ARPA. We believe the CSPF will meet the eligibility requirements and will be allowed to apply for SFA beginning April 1, 2022. We expect that the CSPF will apply for SFA during 2022 in order to continue payment of unreduced benefits through 2051.\nThe passage of the ARPA and the expected receipt of SFA by the CSPF currently eliminates our obligation to provide additional coordinating benefits to the UPS Transfer Group through 2051. These matters also triggered a remeasurement under ASC 715. Accordingly, we remeasured the plan assets and pension benefit obligation of the UPS/IBT Plan as of March 31, 2021.\n79\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe March 31, 2021 interim remeasurement resulted in an actuarial gain of $\n6.4\nbillion, reflecting reduction of the liability for coordinating benefits of $\n5.1\nbillion and a gain from other updated actuarial assumptions of $\n1.3\nbillion. The assumption gain reflects a $\n1.6\nbillion benefit from a\n72\nbasis point increase in the discount rate compared to December 31, 2020, offset by $\n0.3\nbillion asset loss resulting from actual asset returns approximately\n220\nbasis points below our expected return. As a result, $\n3.1\nbillion of the actuarial gain was recorded in AOCI within the equity section of the consolidated balance sheet. The remaining pre-tax actuarial gain of $\n3.3\nbillion ($\n2.5\nbillion after tax) that exceeded the corridor (defined as 10% of the greater of the fair value of plan assets and the plan's projected benefit obligation) was recognized as a mark-to-market gain in the statement of consolidated income.\nThe future value of this estimate will continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including interpretations of the ARPA, future legislative actions, actuarial assumptions and the ability of the PBGC to sustain its commitments. Actual events may result in a change in our best estimate of the projected benefit obligation. We will continue to assess the impact of these uncertainties in accordance with ASC 715.\nOther Actuarial Assumptions\nHealthcare cost trends are used to project future postretirement medical benefits payable from our plans. For purposes of measuring our U.S. plan obligations as of December 31, 2021, a\n6.25\n% annual rate of increase in the postretirement medical benefit costs was assumed; the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to\n4.5\n% by the year 2029 and to remain at that level thereafter.\nFunded Status\nThe following table discloses the funded status of our plans and the amounts recognized in our consolidated balance sheets as of December 31 (in millions):\nThe accumulated benefit obligation for our pension plans as of the measurement dates in 2021 and 2020 was\n$\n62.7\nand $\n66.9\nbillion, respectively. The accumulated benefit obligation for our postretirement medical benefit plans as of the measurement dates in 2021 and 2020 was\n$\n2.6\nand $\n2.8\nbillion, respectively.\nBenefit payments under the pension plans include\n$\n29\na\nnd $\n26\nmillion paid from employer assets in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Benefit payments (net of participant contributions) under the postretirement medical benefit plans includ\ne $\n63\nand $\n77\nmillion paid from employer assets in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Such benefit payments from employer assets are also categorized as employer contributions.\n80\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, the projected benefit obligation, the accumulated benefit obligation and the fair value of plan assets for pension plans with benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were as follows (in millions):\nThe accumulated postretirement benefit obligation presented in the funded status table exceeds plan assets for all U.S. postretirement medical benefit plans.\n81\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBenefit Obligations and Fair Value of Plan Assets\nThe following tables provide a reconciliation of the changes in the plans’ benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets as of the respective measurement dates in each year (in millions):\n2021 -\n$\n6.5\nbillion pre-tax actuarial gain related to benefit obligation:\n•\nDiscount Rates\n(\n$\n2.4\nbillion pre-tax gain): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans increased from\n2.87\n% as of December 31, 2020 to\n3.11\n% as of December 31, 2021, primarily due to an increase in U.S. treasury yields, slightly offset by a decrease in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n•\nCoordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund\n(\n$\n5.1\nbillion pre-tax gain): This represents the reduction in our best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the CSPF before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n•\nDemographic and Assumption Changes\n($\n973\nmillion pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\n82\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2020 - $\n10.1\nbillion pre-tax actuarial loss related to benefit obligation:\n•\nDiscount Rates\n($\n7.3\nbillion pre-tax loss): The weighted-average discount rate for our pension and postretirement medical plans decreased from\n3.55\n% as of December 31, 2019 to\n2.87\n% as of December 31, 2020, primarily due to a decline in U.S. treasury yields that was slightly offset by an increase in credit spreads on AA-rated corporate bonds.\n•\nCoordinating benefits attributable to the Central States Pension Fund\n($\n2.3\nbillion pre-tax loss): This represents our current best estimate of additional potential coordinating benefits that may be required to be paid related to the Central States Pension Fund before taking into account the impact of the change in discount rates.\n•\nDemographic and Assumption Changes\n($\n513\nmillion pre-tax loss): This represents the difference between actual and estimated participant data and demographic factors, including items such as healthcare cost trends, compensation changes, rates of termination, retirement, mortality and other changes.\nPension and Postretirement Plan Assets\nPension assets are invested in accordance with applicable laws and regulations, as well as investment guidelines established by plan trustees. The strategic asset mixes are specifically tailored for each plan given distinct factors, including liability and liquidity needs. Equities, alternative investments, and other higher yielding assets are utilized to generate returns and promote growth. Derivatives, repurchase/reverse repurchase agreements and fixed income securities are utilized as tools for duration management, mitigating interest rate risk, and minimizing funded status volatility.\nThe primary long-term investment objectives for pension assets are to provide for a reasonable amount of long-term growth of capital to meet future obligations while minimizing risk exposures and reducing funded status volatility. To meet these objectives, investment managers are engaged to actively manage assets within the guidelines and strategies set forth by the Investment Committee. Active managers are monitored regularly and their performance is compared to applicable benchmarks. As a result of our long-term U.S. investment objectives for pension assets, the weighted-average long-term expected rate of return on assets decreased from\n7.77\n% during 2020 to\n6.50\n% in 2021.\nFair Value Measurements\nPlan assets valued utilizing Level 1 inputs include equity investments, corporate debt instruments and U.S. government securities. Fair values were determined by closing prices for those securities traded on national stock exchanges, while securities traded in the over-the-counter market and listed securities for which no sale was reported on the valuation date are valued at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices.\nLevel 2 assets include fixed income securities that are valued based on yields currently available on comparable securities of other issues with similar credit ratings; mortgage-backed securities that are valued based on cash flow and yield models using acceptable modeling and pricing conventions; and certain investments that are pooled with other investments in a commingled fund. We value our investments in commingled funds by taking the percentage ownership of the underlying assets, each of which has a readily determinable fair value.\nFair value estimates for certain investments are based on unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by observable market data and are thus classified as Level 3.\nInvestments that do not have a readily determinable fair value, and which provide a net asset value (\"NAV\") or its equivalent developed consistent with FASB measurement principles, are valued using NAV as a practical expedient. These investments are not classified in Levels 1, 2, or 3 of the fair value hierarchy but instead included within the subtotals by asset category. Such investments include hedge funds, risk parity funds, real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds. Investments in hedge funds and risk parity funds are valued using the reported NAV as of December 31st. Real estate investments, private debt and private equity funds are valued at NAV per the most recent partnership audited financial reports, and adjusted, as appropriate, for investment activity between the date of the financial reports and December 31st. Due to the inherent limitations in obtaining a readily determinable fair value measurement for alternative investments, the fair values reported may differ from the values that would have been used had readily available market information for the alternative investments existed. These investments are described further below:\n•\nHedge Funds:\nPlan assets are invested in hedge funds that pursue multiple strategies to diversify risk and reduce volatility. Most of these hedge funds allow redemptions either quarterly or semi-annually after a two to three month notice period, while others allow for redemption after only a brief notification period with no restriction on redemption frequency. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to hedge funds as of December 31, 2021.\n83\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n•\nRisk Parity Funds:\nPlan assets are invested in risk parity strategies in order to provide diversification and balance risk/return objectives. These strategies reflect a multi-asset class balanced risk approach generally consisting of equity, interest rates, credit and commodities. These funds allow for monthly redemptions with only a brief notification period. No unfunded commitments existed with respect to risk parity funds as of December 31, 2021.\n•\nReal Estate, Private Debt and Private Equity Funds:\nPlan assets are invested in limited partnership interests in various private equity, private debt and real estate funds. Limited provision exists for the redemption of these interests by the limited partners that invest in these funds until the end of the term of the partnerships, typically ranging between\n10\nand\n15\nyears from the date of inception. An active secondary market exists for similar partnership interests, although no particular value (discount or premium) can be guaranteed. As of December 31, 2021, unfunded commitments to such limited partnerships totaling approximately $\n3.0\nbillion are expected to be contributed over the remaining investment period, typically ranging between\nthree\nand\nsix years\n.\n84\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe fair values of U.S. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category as of December 31, 2021 are presented below (in millions), as well as the percentage that each category comprises of our total plan assets and the respective target allocations:\n(1)\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy but are included in the category totals.\n(2)\nLevel 2 U.S. Government Securities includes repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements.\n(3)\nRepresents mortgage and asset-backed securities.\n85\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe fair values of U.S. and international pension and postretirement benefit plan assets by asset category as of December 31, 2020 are presented below (in millions), as well as the percentage that each category comprises of our total plan assets and the respective target allocations:\n(1)\nCertain investments that are measured at fair value using the NAV per share (or its equivalent) practical expedient have not been classified in the fair value hierarchy but are included in the category totals.\n(2)\nRepresents mortgage and asset-backed securities.\n86\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table presents the changes in the Level 3 instruments measured on a recurring basis for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nThere were\nno\nshares of UPS class A or B common stock directly held in plan assets as of December 31, 2021 or December 31, 2020.\nExpected Cash Flows\nInformation about expected cash flows for the pension and postretirement medical benefit plans is as follows (in millions):\nOur current funding policy guideline for U.S. plans is to contribute amounts annually that are at least equal to the amounts required by applicable laws and regulations. International plans will be funded in accordance with local regulations. Additional discretionary contributions may be made when deemed appropriate to meet the long-term obligations of the plans. Expected benefit payments for pensions will be primarily paid from plan trusts. Expected benefit payments for postretirement medical benefits will be paid from plan trusts and corporate assets.\n87\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 7.\nMULTIEMPLOYER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS\nWe contribute to a number of multiemployer defined benefit plans under the terms of collective bargaining agreements that cover our union-represented employees. These plans generally provide for retirement, death and/or termination benefits for eligible employees within the applicable collective bargaining units, based on specific eligibility and participation requirements, vesting periods and benefit formulas. The risks of participating in multiemployer plans are different from single-employer plans in the following respects:\n•\nAssets contributed to a multiemployer plan by one employer may be used to provide benefits to employees of other participating employers.\n•\nIf we negotiate to cease participating in a multiemployer plan, we may be required to pay that plan an amount based on our allocable share of its underfunded status, referred to as a \"withdrawal liability\". However, cessation of participation in a multiemployer plan and subsequent payment of any withdrawal liability is subject to the collective bargaining process.\n•\nIf any of the multiemployer pension plans in which we participate enter critical status, and our contributions are not sufficient to satisfy any rehabilitation plan funding schedule, we could be required under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 to make additional surcharge contributions to the multiemployer pension plan in the amount of five to ten percent of the existing contributions required by our labor agreement. Such surcharges would cease upon the ratification of a new collective bargaining agreement and could not recur unless a plan re-entered critical status at a later date.\nThe discussion that follows sets forth the financial impact on our results of operations and cash flows for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, from our participation in multiemployer benefit plans. As part of the overall collective bargaining process for wage and benefit levels, we have agreed to contribute certain amounts to the multiemployer benefit plans during the contract period. The multiemployer benefit plans set benefit levels and are responsible for benefit delivery to participants. Future contributions to multiemployer benefit plans are determined only through collective bargaining, and we have no additional legal or constructive obligation to increase contributions beyond the agreed-upon amounts (except potential surcharges under the Pension Protection Act of 2006 described above).\nThe number of employees covered by our multiemployer pension plans has increased with the growth in our business. There have been no other significant changes that affect the comparability of 2021, 2020 and 2019 contributions. We recognize expense for the contractually-required contribution for each period, and we recognize a liability for any contributions due and unpaid at the end of a reporting period.\nStatus of Collective Bargaining Agreements\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had approximately\n327,000\nemployees employed under a national master agreement and various supplemental agreements with local unions affiliated with the Teamsters. These agreements run through July 31, 2023.\nWe have approximately\n3,200\npilots who are employed under a collective bargaining agreement with the Independent Pilots Association (\"IPA\"). This collective bargaining agreement becomes amendable September 1, 2023.\nWe have approximately\n1,700\nairline mechanics who are covered by a collective bargaining agreement with Teamsters Local 2727 which becomes amendable November 1, 2023. In addition, approximately\n3,300\nof our auto and maintenance mechanics who are not employed under agreements with the Teamsters are employed under collective bargaining agreements with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (\"IAM\"). The collective bargaining agreement with the IAM runs through July 31, 2024.\nMultiemployer Pension Plans\nThe following table outlines our participation in multiemployer pension plans for December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, and sets forth our calendar year contributions and accruals for each plan. The “EIN/Pension Plan Number” column provides the Employer Identification Number (“EIN”) and the three-digit plan number. The most recent Pension Protection Act zone status available in 2021 and 2020 relates to the plans’ two most recent fiscal year ends. The zone status is based on information that we received from the plans’ administrators and is certified by each plan’s actuary. Plans certified in the red zone are generally less than\n65\n% funded; plans certified in the orange zone are both less than\n80\n% funded and have an accumulated funding deficiency, or are expected to have a deficiency in any of the next\nsix\nplan years; plans certified in the yellow zone are less than\n80\n% funded; and plans certified in the green zone are at least\n80\n% funded. The “FIP / RP Status Pending / Implemented” column indicates whether a financial improvement plan (“FIP”) for yellow/orange zone plans, or a rehabilitation plan (“RP”) for red zone plans, is either pending or has been implemented. As of December 31, 2021, all plans that have either a FIP or RP requirement have had the respective plan implemented.\n88\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur collectively-bargained contributions satisfy the requirements of all implemented FIPs and RPs and do not currently require the payment of any surcharges. In addition, minimum contributions outside of the agreed upon contractual rates are not required. For the plans detailed in the following table, the expiration date of the associated collective bargaining agreements is July 31, 2023, with the exception of the IAM National Pension Fund / National Pension Plan, which has a July 31, 2024 expiration date. For all plans detailed in the following table, we provided more than\n5\n% of the total plan contributions from all employers for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (as disclosed in the annual filing with the Department of Labor for each respective plan).\nCertain plans have been aggregated in the “All Other Multiemployer Pension Plans” line in the following table, as contributions to each of these individual plans are not material.\nAgreement with the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund\nIn 2012, we reached an agreement with the New England Teamsters and Trucking Industry Pension Fund (\"NETTI Fund\"), a multiemployer pension plan in which UPS is a participant, to restructure the pension liabilities for approximately\n10,200\nUPS employees represented by the Teamsters. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $\n830\nand $\n837\nmillion, respectively, recognized in Other Non-Current Liabilities as well as $\n8\nand $\n7\nmillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively, recorded in\nOther current liabilities\nin our consolidated balance sheets, representing the remaining balance of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability. This liability is payable in equal monthly installments over a remaining term of approximately\n41\nyears. Based on the borrowing rates currently available to us for long-term financing of a similar maturity, the fair value of the NETTI Fund withdrawal liability as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was $\n963\nmillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy to determine the fair value of this liability.\n89\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMultiemployer Health and Welfare Plans\nWe also contribute to a number of multiemployer health and welfare plans covering both active and retired employees. Healthcare benefits are provided to participants who meet certain eligibility requirements as covered under the applicable collective bargaining unit. The following table sets forth our calendar year plan contributions and accruals. Certain plans have been aggregated in the \"All Other Multiemployer Health and Welfare Plans\" line, as the contributions to each of these individual plans are not material.\n90\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 8.\nGOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS\nThe following table indicates the allocation of goodwill (in millions):\n2021 Goodwill Activity\nThe goodwill acquired in U.S. Domestic Package and Supply Chain Solutions related to our October 2021 acquisition of Roadie. The purchase price allocation for acquired businesses may be modified for up to one year from the date of acquisition if additional facts or circumstances lead to changes in our preliminary purchase accounting estimates. See note 9 for further discussion of business acquisitions.\nThe remaining change in goodwill for both Supply Chain Solutions and International Package was attributable to the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar on the translation of non-U.S. Dollar goodwill balances.\n2020 Goodwill Activity\nAs of December 31, 2020 we classified our UPS Freight reporting unit as held for sale, which resulted in a goodwill impairment charge of $\n494\nmillion within Supply Chain Solutions.\nThe remaining change in goodwill for both Supply Chain Solutions and International Package was due to immaterial purchase accounting adjustments and the impact of changes in the value of the U.S. Dollar on the translation of non-U.S. Dollar goodwill balances.\nGoodwill Impairment\nWe did not record any impairments of goodwill during 2021. In the fourth quarter of 2020, we determined that our UPS Freight reporting unit should be classified as held for sale. Accordingly, we tested goodwill for impairment as of December 31, 2020, and determined that the fair value of the reporting unit had decreased. For the year ended December 31, 2020, a goodwill impairment charge of $\n494\nmillion, representing the remaining goodwill balance for UPS Freight, is included within\nOther expenses\nin the statements of consolidated income. We did\nno\nt record any goodwill impairments during 2019. Cumulatively, we have recorded $\n1.1\nbillion of goodwill impairment charges in Supply Chain Solutions, while our International and U.S. Domestic Package segments have\nno\nt recorded any goodwill impairment charges.\n91\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIntangible Assets\nThe following is a summary of intangible assets as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nA trade name and licenses with carrying values of $\n200\nand $\n4\nmillion, respectively, as of December 31, 2021 are deemed to be indefinite-lived intangible assets, and therefore are not amortized. Impairment tests for indefinite-lived intangible assets are performed annually. Our annual impairment test as of July 1, 2021 indicated that the fair value of the trade name, which is associated with our truckload brokerage business, remained greater than its carrying value, but that the excess was less than 10 percent. There were no events or changes in circumstances that would indicate the carrying amount of our indefinite-lived intangible assets may have been impaired as of December 31, 2021.\nAll of our other recorded intangible assets are deemed to be finite-lived intangibles, and are amortized over their estimated useful lives. Impairment tests for these intangible assets are only performed when a triggering event occurs that may indicate that the carrying value of the intangible may not be recoverable. Impairments of finite-lived intangible assets were $\n19\n, $\n13\n, and $\n2\nmillion in 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.\nAmortization of intangible assets was $\n475\n, $\n416\nand $\n377\nmillion in each of 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Expected amortization of finite-lived intangible assets recorded as of December 31, 2021 for the next five years is as follows (in millions): 2022—$\n540\n; 2023—$\n472\n; 2024—$\n392\n; 2025—$\n314\n; 2026—$\n222\n. Amortization expense in future periods will be affected by business acquisitions and divestitures, software development, licensing agreements, purchase of development areas or similar franchise rights and other factors.\n92\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 9.\nBUSINESS ACQUISITIONS\nIn October 2021, we acquired Roadie, Inc. (\"Roadie\"), a technology platform that provides local same-day delivery with operations throughout the United States. The Roadie technology platform is purpose-built to connect merchants and consumers with contract drivers to enable efficient and scalable same-day local delivery services for items that are not compatible with the UPS network. The acquisition was funded using cash from operations. We report Roadie within Supply Chain Solutions. The financial results of the acquired business were not material to our results of operations for the fourth quarter or the year.\nThe estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed are subject to change based on completion of our purchase accounting. The purchase price allocation for acquired companies can be modified for up to one year from the date of acquisition.\nThe following table summarizes the estimated fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the acquisition date (in millions):\nGoodwill recognized of approximately $\n375\nmillion is attributable to expected synergies from future growth, including synergies to our U.S. Domestic Package segment. We have allocated $\n243\nand $\n132\nmillion of the recognized goodwill to Supply Chain Solutions and the U.S. Domestic Package segment, respectively. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.\nThe intangible assets acquired of approximately $\n231\nmillion primarily consist of $\n145\nmillion of technology (amortized over\n8\nyears), $\n67\nmillion of trade name (amortized over\n10\nyears), and an additional $\n19\nmillion in other intangibles (amortized over an average of\n8\nyears). The carrying value of accounts receivable approximates fair value.\nAcquisition related costs were not material, and were expensed as incurred and included in\nOther expenses\nwithin the statements of consolidated income.\n93\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 10.\nDEBT AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS\nThe carrying value of our outstanding debt obligations, as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 consists of the following (in millions)\n:\n(1)\nOn April 1, 2020, the interest rate on these debentures decreased from\n8.375\n% to\n7.620\n% for the remaining\n10\nyears until maturity.\n94\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nCommercial Paper\nWe are authorized to borrow up to $\n10.0\nbillion under a U.S. commercial paper program and €\n5.0\nbillion (in a variety of currencies) under a European commercial paper program. As of December 31, 2021 we had\nno\noutstanding balances under these commercial paper programs. The amount of commercial paper outstanding under these programs in 2022 is expected to fluctuate.\nDebt Repayments\nOn January 15, 2021, our\n3.125\n% senior notes with a principal balance of $\n1.5\nbillion matured and were repaid in full. On April 1, 2021, our\n2.050\n% fixed-rate senior notes with a principal balance of $\n700\nmillion and our floating rate senior notes with a principal balance of $\n350\nmillion matured and were both repaid in full.\nFixed-Rate Senior Notes\nAll of our fixed-rate notes pay interest semi-annually, and allow for redemption by UPS at any time by paying the greater of the principal amount or a “make-whole” amount, plus accrued interest. We subsequently entered into interest rate swaps on certain of these notes, which effectively converted the fixed interest rates on the notes to variable interest rates.\nThe average interest rates payable on the notes where fixed interest rates were swapped to variable interest rates, including the impact of the interest rate swaps, for 2021 and 2020 were as follows:\n7.620\n% Debentures\nThe $\n276\nmillion debentures have a maturity of April 1, 2030. These debentures had an interest rate of\n8.375\n% until April 1, 2020, at which time the interest rate decreased to\n7.620\n% for the remaining term. These debentures are redeemable in whole or in part at our option at any time. The redemption price is equal to the greater of the principal amount plus accrued interest, or the present value of remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark treasury yield plus five basis points, plus accrued interest. Interest is payable semi-annually in April and October, and the debentures are not subject to sinking fund requirements.\nFloating-Rate Senior Notes\nOur floating-rate senior notes bear interest at rates that reference the London Interbank Offer Rate (\"LIBOR\") for U.S. Dollars. As part of a broader program of reference rate reform, it is expected that U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates will cease to be published after June 2023.\nWe have floating-rate senior notes in the principal amounts of $\n400\nand $\n500\nmillion that bear interest at three-month LIBOR, plus a spread of\n38\nand\n45\nbasis points, respectively. These notes are not callable. The $\n400\nmillion notes mature in 2022 and the $\n500\nmillion notes mature in 2023, prior to the expected discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR. The average interest rate for 2021 and 2020, including interest on the $\n350\nmillion floating-rate senior notes that matured on April 1, 2021, was\n0.58\n% and\n1.29\n%, respectively.\nThe remaining floating-rate senior notes, with principal amounts totaling $\n1.0\nbillion, bear interest at either one or three-month LIBOR, less a spread ranging from\n30\nto\n45\nbasis points. These notes have maturities ranging from 2049 through 2067 and will be impacted by the discontinuance of U.S. Dollar LIBOR rates in June 2023. We are currently working to transition these notes to an alternative reference rate. We anticipate that the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (\"SOFR\") will be adopted in accordance with recommendations of the Alternative Reference Rates Committee.\nThe average interest rate on the remaining floating-rate senior notes for 2021 and 2020 was\n0.00\n% and\n0.40\n%, respectively. These notes are callable at various times after\n30\nyears at a stated percentage of par value, and redeemable at the option of the note holders at various times after\none year\nat a stated percentage of par value.  We have classified these floating-rate senior notes as long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets, due to our intent and ability to refinance the debt if the put option is exercised.\n95\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFinance Lease Obligations\nWe have certain property, plant and equipment subject to finance leases. For additional information on finance lease obligations, see note 12.\nFacility Notes and Bonds\nWe have entered into agreements with certain municipalities or related entities to finance the construction of, or improvements to, facilities that support our operations in the United States. These facilities are located around airport properties in Louisville, Kentucky; Dallas, Texas; and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Under these arrangements, we enter into a lease or loan agreement that covers the debt service obligations on the bonds issued by these entities, as follows:\n•\nBonds with a principal balance of $\n149\nmillion issued by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority associated with our Worldport facility in Louisville, Kentucky. The bonds, which are due in January 2029, bear interest at a variable rate, and the average interest rates for 2021 and 2020 were\n0.05\n% and\n0.50\n%, respectively.\n•\nBonds with a principal balance of $\n42\nmillion and due in November 2036 issued by the Louisville Regional Airport Authority associated with our air freight facility in Louisville, Kentucky.

These notes are callable at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount, or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark German government bond yield plus\n20\nbasis points, plus accrued interest.\n•\nNotes with principal amounts of €\n700\nmillion and €\n500\nmillion accrue interest at\n0.375\n% and\n1.50\n% fixed rates, respectively, and are due in November 2023 and November 2032, respectively. Interest on these notes is payable annually. The notes are callable at our option at a redemption price equal to the greater of the principal amount, or the present value of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon discounted to the date of redemption at a benchmark comparable government bond yield plus\n10\nand\n20\nbasis points, respectively, plus accrued interest.\nContractual Commitments\nThe following table sets forth the aggregate annual principal and anticipated interest payments on our long-term debt and our projected aggregate annual purchase commitments (in millions):\n(1)\nDebt interest and purchase commitments include estimates of future amounts yet to be recognized in our financial statements.\nThe amount of interest on our debt was calculated as the contractual interest payments due on our fixed-rate debt and variable-rate debt based on interest rates as of December 31, 2021, taking into account the effect of any interest rate swap agreements. For debt denominated in a foreign currency, the U.S. Dollar equivalent principal amount of the debt at the end of the year was used as the basis to project future interest payments.\nPurchase commitments represent contractual agreements to purchase assets, goods or services that are legally binding, including contracts for aircraft, construction of new or expanded facilities and orders for technology equipment and vehicles.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately $\n1.7\nbillion issued in connection with our self-insurance reserves and other routine business requirements. We also issue surety bonds as an alternative to letters of credit in certain instances, and as of December 31, 2021, we had $\n1.5\nbillion of surety bonds written.\nSources of Credit\nWe maintain\ntwo\ncredit agreements with a consortium of banks. The first of these agreements provides revolving credit facilities of $\n1.0\nbillion and expires on December 6, 2022. Amounts outstanding under this agreement bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the term SOFR rate, plus\n0.10\n% per annum and an applicable margin based on our then-current credit rating. The applicable margin from the credit pricing grid as of December 31, 2021 was\n0.875\n%. Alternatively, a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in the United States; (2) the Federal Funds effective rate plus\n0.50\n%; or (3) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for a one month interest period plus\n1\n%, may be used at our discretion.\n97\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe second agreement provides revolving credit facilities of $\n2.0\nbillion and expires on December 7, 2026. Amounts outstanding under this facility bear interest at a periodic fixed rate equal to the term SOFR rate plus\n0.10\n% per annum and an applicable margin based on our then-current credit rating. The applicable margin from the credit pricing grid as of December 31, 2021 was\n0.875\n%. Alternatively, a fluctuating rate of interest equal to the highest of (1) the rate of interest last quoted by The Wall Street Journal as the prime rate in the United States; (2) the Federal Funds effective rate plus\n0.50\n%; and (3) the Adjusted Term SOFR Rate for a one-month interest period plus\n1.00\n%, plus an applicable margin, may be used at our discretion.\nIf the credit ratings established by S&P and Moody’s differ, the higher rating will be used, except in cases where the lower rating is two or more levels lower. In these circumstances, the rating one step below the higher rating will be used. We are also able to request advances under these facilities based on competitive bids for the applicable interest rate. There were\nno\namounts outstanding under these facilities as of December 31, 2021.\nDebt Covenants\nOur existing debt instruments and credit facilities subject us to certain financial covenants. As of December 31, 2021 and for all prior periods presented, we have satisfied these financial covenants. These covenants limit the amount of secured indebtedness that we may incur, and limit the amount of attributable debt in sale-leaseback transactions, to\n10\n% of net tangible assets. As of December 31, 2021,\n10\n% of net tangible assets is equivalent to $\n4.6\nbillion; however, we have no covered sale-leaseback transactions or secured indebtedness outstanding. We do not expect these covenants to have a material impact on our financial condition or liquidity.\nFair Value of Debt\nBased on the borrowing rates currently available to us for long-term debt with similar terms and maturities, the fair value of long-term debt, including current maturities, was approximately $\n25.1\nbillion and $\n28.3\nbillion as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We utilized Level 2 inputs in the fair value hierarchy of valuation techniques to determine the fair value of all of our debt instruments.\n98\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 11.\nLEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CONTINGENCIES\nWe are involved in a number of judicial proceedings and other matters arising from the conduct of our business.\nAlthough there can be no assurance as to the ultimate outcome, we have generally denied, or believe we have meritorious defenses and will deny, liability in all pending matters, including (except as otherwise noted herein) the matters described below, and we intend to vigorously defend each matter. We accrue amounts associated with legal proceedings when and to the extent a loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated. The actual costs of resolving legal proceedings may be substantially higher or lower than the amounts accrued on those claims.\nFor matters as to which we are not able to estimate a possible loss or range of losses, we are not able to determine whether any such loss will have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. For these matters, we have described the reasons that we are unable to estimate a possible loss or range of losses.\nJudicial Proceedings\nWe are a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in state and federal courts containing various class action allegations under state wage-and-hour laws. At this time, we do not believe that any loss associated with any such matter will have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. One of these matters, Hughes v. UPS Supply Chain Solutions, Inc. and United Parcel Service, Inc. had previously been certified as a class action in Kentucky state court. In the second quarter of 2019, the court granted our motion for judgment on the pleadings related to the wage-and-hour claims. The plaintiffs appealed this decision. The appeal was denied; however, plaintiffs have sought discretionary review by the Kentucky Supreme Court.\nOther Matters\nIn October 2015, the Department of Justice (\"DOJ\") informed us of an industry-wide inquiry into the transportation of mail under the United States Postal Service (\"USPS\") International Commercial Air contracts. In October 2017, we received a Civil Investigative Demand seeking certain information relating to our contracts. The DOJ has indicated it is investigating potential violations of the False Claims Act or other statutes. We are cooperating with the DOJ. An immaterial accrual with respect to this matter is included in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not believe that any loss from this matter would have a material impact on our operations or financial condition, although we are unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by any government authorities as a result of their investigation.\nIn August 2016, Spain’s National Markets and Competition Commission (\"CNMC\") announced an investigation into\n10\ncompanies in the commercial delivery and parcel industry, including UPS, related to alleged nonaggression agreements to allocate customers. In May 2017, UPS received a Statement of Objections issued by the CNMC. In July 2017, UPS received a Proposed Decision from the CNMC. On March 8, 2018, the CNMC adopted a final decision, finding an infringement and imposing an immaterial fine on UPS. UPS appealed the decision and, in September 2018, obtained a suspension of the implementation of the decision (including payment of the fine). The appeal is pending. We do not believe that any loss from this matter would have a material impact on our operations or financial condition. We are vigorously defending ourselves and believe that we have a number of meritorious legal defenses. There are also unresolved questions of law and fact that could be important to the ultimate resolution of this matter.\nIn November 2021, the Environmental Protection Agency (the \"EPA\") sent us an information request related to hazardous waste regulatory compliance at certain of our facilities. The EPA has indicated that it is investigating potential recordkeeping violations of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act at those facilities. We are cooperating with the EPA. An immaterial accrual with respect to this matter is included in our consolidated balance sheets. We do not believe that any loss from this matter would have a material impact on our operations or financial condition, although we are unable to predict what action, if any, might be taken in the future by the EPA as a result of this request.\nWe are a party in various other matters that arose in the normal course of business. We do not believe that the eventual resolution of these other matters (either individually or in the aggregate), including any reasonably possible losses in excess of current accruals, will have a material impact on our operations or financial condition.\n99\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 12.\nLEASES\nWe have finance and operating leases for package centers, airport facilities, warehouses, office space, aircraft, aircraft engines, information technology equipment (primarily mainframes, servers and copiers), vehicles and various other equipment used in operating our business. Certain leases for real estate and aircraft contain options to purchase, extend or terminate the lease.\nWe recognize a right-of-use (\"ROU\") asset and lease obligation for all leases greater than twelve months. Some of our leases contain both lease and non-lease components, which we have elected to treat as a single lease component. We have also elected not to recognize leases that have an original lease term, including reasonably certain renewal or purchase options, of twelve months or less in our consolidated balance sheets for all classes of underlying assets. Lease costs for short-term leases are recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.\nDetermining the lease term and amount of lease payments to include in the calculation of the ROU asset and lease obligation for leases containing options requires the use of judgment to determine whether the exercise of an option is reasonably certain and whether the optional period and payments should be included in the calculation of the associated ROU asset and lease obligation. In making this determination, we consider all relevant economic factors that would compel us to exercise or not exercise an option.\nWhen our leases contain future payments that are dependent on an index or rate, such as the consumer price index, we initially measure the lease obligation and ROU asset using the index or rate at the commencement date. In subsequent periods, lease payments dependent on an index or rate are not remeasured. Rather, changes to payments due to a change in an index or rate are recognized in our statements of consolidated income in the period of the change.\nWhen available, we use the rate implicit in the lease to discount lease payments; however, the rate implicit in the lease is not readily determinable for substantially all of our leases. For these leases, we use an estimate of our incremental borrowing rate to discount lease payments based on information available at lease commencement. The incremental borrowing rate is derived using multiple inputs including our credit rating, the impact of full collateralization, lease term and denominated currency. The remaining lease terms vary from\n1\nmonth to\n139\nyears.\nAircraft\nIn addition to the aircraft that we own, we have leases for\n329\naircraft. Of these leased aircraft,\n22\nare classified as finance leases,\n18\nare classified as operating leases and the remaining\n289\nare classified as short-term leases. A majority of the obligations associated with the aircraft classified as finance leases have been legally defeased. A majority of our long-term aircraft operating leases are operated by a third party to handle package and cargo volume in geographic regions where, due to government regulations, we are restricted from operating an airline.\nIn order to meet customers' needs, we charter aircraft to handle package and cargo volume on certain international trade lanes and domestic routes. Due to the nature of these agreements, primarily being that either party can cancel the agreement with short notice, we have classified these as short-term leases. Additionally, the lease payments associated with these charter agreements are variable in nature based on the number of hours flown.\nReal Estate\nWe have operating and finance leases for package centers, airport facilities, warehouses, office space and expansion facilities utilized during peak shipping periods. Many of our leases contain charges for common area maintenance or other expenses that are updated based on landlord estimates. Due to this variability, the cash flows associated with these charges are not included in the minimum lease payments used in determining the ROU asset and associated lease obligation.\nSome of our real estate leases contain options to renew or extend the lease or terminate the lease before the expiration date. These options are factored into the determination of the lease term and lease payments when their exercise is considered to be reasonably certain.\nWe also enter into real estate leases that contain lease incentives, such as tenant improvement allowances or move-in allowances, that are received or receivable at lease commencement. These incentives reduce lease payments for classification purposes and reduce the initial ROU asset. When lease incentives are receivable at lease commencement, they also reduce the initial lease obligation.\n100\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFrom time to time, we enter into leases with the intention of purchasing the property, either through purchase options with a fixed price or a purchase agreement negotiated contemporaneously with the lease agreement. We classify these leases as finance leases and include the purchase date and purchase price in the determination of the lease term and lease payments, respectively, when the option to exercise or purchase is reasonably certain.\nTransportation equipment and other equipment\nWe enter into both long-term and short-term leases for transportation equipment to supplement our capacity or meet contractual demands. Some of these assets are leased on a month-to-month basis and the leases can be terminated without penalty. The lease term for these types of leases is determined by the length of the underlying customer contract or based on the judgment of the business unit. We also enter into multi-year leases for trailers to increase capacity during periods of high demand, which are typically only used for 90-120 days during the year. These leases are treated as short-term as the cumulative right of use is less than 12 months over the term of the contract.\nThe remainder of our leases are primarily related to equipment used in our air operations, vehicles required to meet capacity needs during periods of higher demand for our shipping services, technology equipment and office equipment used in our facilities.\nSome of our transportation and technology equipment leases require us to make additional lease payments based on the underlying usage of the assets. Due to the variable nature of these costs, these are expensed as incurred and are not included in the ROU asset and associated lease obligation.\nThe components of lease expense for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 were as follows (in millions):\nIn addition to the lease costs disclosed in the table above, we monitor all lease categories for any indicators that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. We recognized impairment charges of $\n17\nmillion for the year ended December 31, 2020. There were\nno\nimpairments recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2019.\n101\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nMaturities of lease obligations as of December 31, 2021 are as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021, we have additional leases which have not commenced of $\n348\nmillion. These leases will commence in 2022 and 2023 when we are granted access to the property, such as when leasehold improvements are completed by the lessor or a certificate of occupancy is obtained.\n103\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 13.\nSHAREOWNERS' EQUITY\nCapital Stock, Additional Paid-In Capital, Retained Earnings and Non-Controlling Minority Interests\nWe are authorized to issue\ntwo\nclasses of common stock, which are distinguished from each other by their respective voting rights. Class A shares of UPS are entitled to\n10\nvotes per share, whereas class B shares are entitled to\none\nvote per share. Class A shares are primarily held by UPS employees and retirees, as well as trusts and descendants of the Company's founders, and these shares are fully convertible into class B shares at any time. Class B shares are publicly traded on the New York Stock Exchange (\"NYSE\") under the symbol \"UPS\". Class A and B shares both have a $\n0.01\npar value, and as of December 31, 2021, there were\n4.6\nbillion class A shares and\n5.6\nbillion class B shares authorized to be issued. Additionally, there are\n200\nmillion preferred shares authorized to be issued, with a par value of $\n0.01\nper share. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\npreferred shares had been issued.\nThe following is a rollforward of our common stock, additional paid-in capital, retained earnings and non-controlling minority interests accounts for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions, except per share amounts):\n(1)\nThe dividend per share amount is the same for both class A and class B common stock. Dividends include $\n167\n, $\n178\nand $\n147\nmillion for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, that were settled in shares of class A common stock.\n104\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nIn May 2016, the Board of Directors approved a share repurchase authorization of $\n8.0\nbillion of class A and class B common stock. For the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, we repurchased a total of\n2.1\nand\n9.1\nmillion shares of class A and class B common stock for $\n217\nmillion and $\n1.0\nbillion, respectively under this program ($\n224\nmillion and $\n1.0\nbillion in repurchases for 2020 and 2019, respectively, are reported on the statements of consolidated cash flows due to the timing of settlements). We did\nno\nt repurchase any shares under this program during 2021.\nIn August 2021, the Board of Directors terminated this authorization and approved a new share repurchase authorization of $\n5.0\nbillion for class A and class B common stock. We repurchased\n2.6\nmillion shares of class B common stock for $\n500\nmillion under an accelerated stock repurchase transaction pursuant to this authorization during the year ended December 31, 2021. As of December 31, 2021, we had $\n4.5\nbillion of this share repurchase authorization available. Unless terminated earlier by the Board of Directors, this program will expire when we have purchased all shares authorized for repurchase under the program.\nShare repurchases may be in the form of accelerated share repurchase programs, open market purchases or other methods we deem appropriate. The timing of share repurchases will depend upon market conditions. In order to lower the average cost of acquiring shares in our ongoing share repurchase program, we periodically enter into structured repurchase agreements involving the use of capped call options for the purchase of UPS class B shares. We pay a fixed sum of cash upon execution of each agreement in exchange for the right to receive either a predetermined amount of cash or stock. Upon expiration of each agreement, if the closing market price of our common stock is above the predetermined price, we will have our initial investment returned with a premium in either cash or shares (at our election). If the closing market price of our common stock is at or below the pre-determined price, we will receive the number of shares specified in the agreement. We received net premiums of $\n21\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2019 related to entering into and settling capped call options for the purchase of class B shares. We had\nno\ncapped call options outstanding, nor did we enter into any of these structured repurchase agreements, during the years ended December 31, 2021 or 2020.\nMovements in additional paid-in capital in respect of stock award plans comprise accruals for unvested awards, offset by adjustments for awards that vest during the period. The movement year over year was driven by changes in award payouts and by the acceleration of vesting for certain of our awards in 2020.\n105\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAccumulated Other Comprehensive Income (Loss)\nWe recognize activity in AOCI for foreign currency translation adjustments, unrealized holding gains and losses on available-for-sale securities, unrealized gains and losses from derivatives that qualify as hedges of cash flows and unrecognized pension and postretirement benefit costs.\nThe activity in AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions):\n106\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nDetail of the gains (losses) reclassified from AOCI to the statements of consolidated income for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions):\nDeferred Compensation Obligations and Treasury Stock\nWe maintain a deferred compensation plan whereby certain employees were previously able to elect to defer the gains on stock option exercises by deferring the shares received upon exercise into a rabbi trust. The shares held in this trust are classified as treasury stock, and the liability to participating employees is classified as\nDeferred compensation obligations\nin the shareowners’ equity section of the consolidated balance sheets. The number of shares needed to settle the liability for deferred\ncompensation obligations is included in the denominator in both the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations. Employees\nare generally not able to defer the gains from stock options exercised subsequent to December 31, 2004.\nActivity in the deferred compensation program for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was as follows (in millions):\n107\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 14.\nSTOCK - BASED COMPENSATION\nOur various incentive compensation plans permit the grant of non-qualified and incentive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock and stock units (\"RSUs\"), and restricted performance shares and performance units (\"RPUs\", collectively with RSUs, \"Restricted Units\"). On May 13, 2021, our shareholders approved our 2021 Omnibus Incentive Compensation Plan under which we are authorized to issue awards underlying\n25\nmillion shares. Each award issued in the form of Restricted Units, stock options and other permitted awards reduces the share reserve by\none\nshare. We had\n19\nmillion\nshares available to be issued under the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan as of December 31, 2021.\nOur primary equity compensation programs are the UPS Management Incentive Award program (the \"MIP\"), the UPS Long-Term Incentive Performance Award program (the \"LTIP\") and the UPS Stock Option program. Additionally, our matching contributions to our primary employee defined contribution savings plan are made in shares of UPS class A common stock. The total expense recognized in our statements of consolidated income under all stock compensation programs during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n878\n, $\n796\nand $\n915\nmillion, respectively. The associated income tax benefit recognized in our statements of consolidated income during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n301\n, $\n210\nand $\n216\nmillion, respectively. The cash income tax benefit received from the exercise of stock options and conversion of Restricted Units to class A shares during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n278\n, $\n272\nand $\n148\nmillion, respectively.\nManagement Incentive Award Program (\"MIP\")\nNon-executive management eligibility for MIP awards is determined annually by the executive officers of UPS. Awards granted to executive officers are determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the UPS Board of Directors. Our MIP provides, with certain exceptions, that one-half to two-thirds of the annual award will be made in RPUs, depending upon the level of management. The remaining one-third to one-half of the award is electable in the form of cash or unrestricted shares of class A common stock, and is fully vested at the time of grant. Upon conversion, RPUs result in the issuance of an equivalent number of UPS class A shares after required tax withholdings.\nBeginning with the MIP grant in the first quarter of 2019, RPUs vest\none year\nfollowing the grant date based on continued employment with the Company (except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs). The grant value is expensed on a straight-line basis (less estimated forfeitures) over the requisite service period (except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case immediate expensing occurs). RPUs granted under the MIP prior to 2019 vest over a\nfive-year\nperiod with approximately\n20\n% of the award vesting and converting to class A shares at the anniversary of each grant date. As of December 31, 2020, outstanding RPUs granted to non-executive management prior to 2019 became fully vested. The elimination of the future service requirement for these awards resulted in the recognition of an additional $\n133\nmillion of stock compensation expense in 2020. Conversion to class A shares will continue to occur over the remaining\nfive-year\nperiod.\nAll RPUs granted are subject to early cancellation or vesting under certain conditions. Dividends earned on RPUs are reinvested in additional RPUs at each dividend payable date until they have fully vested.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following outstanding RPUs, including reinvested dividends, granted under the MIP:\nThe fair value of each RPU is the NYSE closing price of class B common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RPUs granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n165.27\n, $\n102.54\nand $\n108.78\n, respectively. The total fair value of RPUs vested was $\n716\n, $\n827\nand $\n457\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $\n85\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RPUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\nfour months\n.\n108\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nLong-Term Incentive Performance Award Program (\"LTIP\")\nRPUs issued under the LTIP vest at the end of a\nthree-year\nperformance period, assuming continued employment with the Company (except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs on a prorated basis). The number of RPUs earned is based on achievement of the performance targets established on the grant date.\nFor LTIP awards with a performance period ended December 31, 2021, the performance targets were equally weighted among consolidated operating return on invested capital (\"ROIC\"), growth in currency-constant consolidated revenue and total shareholder return (\"RTSR\") relative to a peer group of companies. For the two-thirds of the award related to ROIC and growth in currency-constant consolidated revenue, we recognized the grant date fair value of these RPUs (less estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period, based on the number of awards expected to be earned. The remaining one-third of the award was valued using a Monte Carlo model. We recognized the grant date fair value of this portion of the award (less estimated forfeitures) as compensation expense ratably over the vesting period.\nFor LTIP awards with a performance period ending in 2022 and 2023, the performance targets are equally weighted between adjusted earnings per share and adjusted cumulative free cash flow. The final number of RPUs earned will then be subject to adjustment based on RTSR relative to the Standard & Poors 500 Index (\"S&P 500\"). We determine the grant date fair value of the RPUs using a Monte Carlo model and recognize compensation expense (less estimated forfeitures) ratably over the vesting period, based on the number of awards expected to be earned.\nFor the 2020 LTIP award, the performance period was divided into two measurement periods. The first measurement period evaluated the achievement of the performance targets for 2020. The second measurement period will evaluate the achievement of the performance targets for 2021 and 2022.\nThe weighted-average assumptions used in our Monte Carlo models for each award year were as follows:\nThere is no expected dividend yield as units earn dividend equivalents.\nAs of December 31, 2021, we had the following RPUs outstanding, including reinvested dividends, that were granted under our LTIP program:\nThe fair value of each RPU is the NYSE closing price of class B common stock on the date of grant. The weighted-average grant date fair value of RPUs granted during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n168.10\n, $\n92.76\nand $\n107.30\n, respectively. The total fair value of RPUs vested was $\n160\n, $\n112\nand $\n71\nmillion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $\n160\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested RPUs. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of one year and six months.\n109\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNon-qualified Stock Options\nWe maintain stock option plans under which options are granted to purchase shares of UPS class A common stock. Stock options granted in connection with the UPS Incentive Compensation Plan must have an exercise price at least equal to the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the date the option is granted.\nWe grant non-qualified stock options to a limited group of eligible senior management employees annually, in which the value granted is determined as a percentage of salary. Stock option awards vest over a\nfive-year\nperiod with approximately\n20\n% of the award vesting at each anniversary of the grant date (except in the case of death, disability or retirement, in which case immediate vesting occurs). The option grants expire 10 years after the date of the grant. Option holders may exercise their options via the payment of cash or class A common stock and new class A shares are issued upon exercise.\nThe following is an analysis of options to purchase shares of class A common stock issued and outstanding:\nThe fair value of each option grant is estimated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average assumptions used by year, and the calculated weighted-average fair values of options, are as follows:\nThe expected dividend yield is based on the recent historical dividend yields for our stock, taking into account changes in dividend policy. The risk-free interest rate is based on the term structure of interest rates at the time of the option grant. The expected life represents an estimate of the period of time options are expected to remain outstanding, and we have relied upon a combination of the observed exercise behavior of our prior grants with similar characteristics, the vesting schedule of the grants and an index of peer companies with similar grant characteristics in estimating this variable. Expected volatilities are based on the historical returns on our stock and the implied volatility of our publicly-traded options.\nWe received cash of $\n16\n, $\n28\nand $\n7\nmillion during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively, from option holders resulting from the exercise of stock options. The total intrinsic value of options exercised during 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $\n16\n, $\n17\nand $\n5\nmillion, respectively. As of December 31, 2021, there was $\n4\nmillion of total unrecognized compensation cost related to non-vested options. That cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of\nthree years\nand five months.\nDiscounted Employee Stock Purchase Plan\nWe maintain an employee stock purchase plan for all eligible employees. Under this plan, shares of UPS class A common stock may be purchased at quarterly intervals at\n95\n% of the NYSE closing price of UPS class B common stock on the last day of each quarterly period. Employees purchased\n0.6\n,\n0.9\nand\n1.0\nmillion shares at average prices of $\n172.07\n, $\n110.92\nand $\n102.11\nper share, during 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively. This plan is not considered to be compensatory, and therefore no compensation cost is measured for the employees’ purchase rights.\n110\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 15.\nSEGMENT AND GEOGRAPHIC INFORMATION\nWe have\ntwo\nreportable segments: U.S. Domestic Package and International Package, which are together referred to as our global small package operations. Our remaining businesses are reported as Supply Chain Solutions. Global small package operations represent our most significant business and are broken down into regional operations around the world. Regional operations managers are responsible for both domestic and export products within their geographic area. Supply Chain Solutions comprises the results of non-reportable operating segments that do not meet the quantitative and qualitative criteria of a reportable segment as defined under ASC Topic 280 – Segment Reporting.\nU.S. Domestic Package\nU.S. Domestic Package operations include the time-definite delivery of letters, documents and packages throughout the United States.\nInternational Package\nInternational Package operations include delivery to more than\n220\ncountries and territories worldwide, including shipments wholly outside the United States, as well as shipments with either origin or destination outside the United States. Our International Package reporting segment includes our operations in Europe, Asia, Americas and ISMEA.\nSupply Chain Solutions\nSupply Chain Solutions includes our Forwarding, Logistics, Coyote, Marken, UPS Mail Innovations and other businesses.

Operating profit is before investment income (expense) and other, interest expense and income tax expense. Certain expenses are allocated between the segments using activity-based costing methods as described in Part I, \"Item 7. Supplemental Information - Items Affecting Comparability\" section of Management's Discussion and Analysis. As we operate an integrated, global multimodal network, we evaluate many of our capital expenditure decisions at a network level. Accordingly, expenditures on property, plant and equipment by segment are not presented. Unallocated assets are comprised primarily of cash and marketable securities.\n111\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC.

AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nGeographic information for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 is as follows (in millions):\nLong-lived assets include property, plant and equipment, pension and postretirement benefit assets, long-term investments, goodwill and intangible assets.\nNo\ncountries outside of the United States provided 10% or more of consolidated revenue for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 or 2019. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, Amazon.com, Inc. and its affiliates (\"Amazon\") represented\n11.7\n%,\n13.3\n% and\n11.6\n% of our consolidated revenues, respectively. Substantially all of this revenue was attributed to U.S. Domestic Package. Amazon accounted for approximately\n15.5\n%,\n18.1\n% and\n16.9\n% of accounts receivable, net, included within the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\n113\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 16.\nINCOME TAXES\nThe income tax expense (benefit) for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following (in millions):\nIncome before income taxes includes the following components (in millions):\nA reconciliation of the statutory federal income tax rate to the effective income tax rate for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 consists of the following:\n(1)\nThe 2020 state tax impact to the effective tax rate is negative due to the favorable proportion of state tax credits in comparison to pretax income.\nOur effective tax rate is affected by recurring factors, such as statutory tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate and the relative amounts of taxable income we earn in those jurisdictions. It is also affected by discrete items that may occur in any given year, but may not be consistent from year to year.\nOur effective tax rate was\n22.3\n% in 2021, compared with\n27.2\n% in 2020 and\n21.4\n% in 2019, primarily due to the effects of the aforementioned recurring factors and the following discrete tax items.\n114\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\n2021 Discrete Items\nWe recognized an income tax expense of $\n784\nmillion related to a pre-tax mark-to-market gain of $\n3.3\nbillion on our pension and U.S. postretirement defined benefit plans. This income tax expense was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2021 U.S. federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\nWe recorded pre-tax transformation strategy costs of $\n380\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021. As a result, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $\n95\nmillion. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2021 U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\nWe recorded a pre-tax gain of $\n46\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2021 related to the divestiture of UPS Freight. As a result, we recorded an additional income tax expense of $\n11\nmillion. This income tax expense was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2021 U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the effect of U.S. state and local taxes.\nThe recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based compensation in income tax expense resulted in a net tax benefit of $\n105\nmillion and reduced our effective tax rate by\n0.6\n% during the year ended December 31, 2021.\n2020 Discrete Items\nIn the fourth quarter of 2020, we recognized an income tax benefit of $\n1.6\nbillion related to pre-tax mark-to-market losses of $\n6.5\nbillion on our pension and U.S. postretirement defined benefit plans. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2020 U.S. federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\nWe recorded pre-tax transformation strategy costs of $\n348\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $\n83\nmillion. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2020 U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\nWe recorded pre-tax goodwill and other asset impairment charges of $\n686\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2020. As a result, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $\n57\nmillion. This income tax benefit was generated at a lower average tax rate than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the portion of the costs related to goodwill impairment, which is not deductible for tax purposes.\nThe recognition of excess tax benefits and deficiencies related to share-based compensation in income tax expense resulted in a net tax benefit of $\n28\nmillion and reduced our effective tax rate by\n1.5\n% during the year ended December 31, 2020.\nOur 2020 effective tax rate was also unfavorably impacted by new uncertain tax positions.\n2019 Discrete Items\nIn the fourth quarter of 2019, we recognized an income tax benefit of $\n571\nmillion related to pre-tax mark-to-market losses of $\n2.4\nbillion on our pension and U.S. postretirement defined benefit plans. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2019 U.S. federal statutory tax rate because it included the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\nWe recorded pre-tax transformation strategy costs of $\n255\nmillion during the year ended December 31, 2019. As a result, we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $\n59\nmillion. This income tax benefit was generated at a higher average tax rate than the 2019 U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the effect of U.S. state and local and foreign taxes.\nLegal contingencies and expenses of $\n97\nmillion were accrued during 2019 in respect of certain legal proceedings for which we recorded an additional income tax benefit of $\n6\nmillion. This income tax benefit was generated at a lower average tax rate than the U.S. federal statutory tax rate due to the portion of the accrual related to penalties, which are not deductible for tax purposes.\n115\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nAs of December 31, 2018, we maintained a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets, primarily related to foreign net operating loss carryforwards. As of each reporting date, we consider new evidence, both positive and negative, that could affect the future realization of deferred tax assets. During 2019, we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence to conclude that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets related to certain foreign net operating loss carryforwards would be realized. This conclusion was primarily related to achieving cumulative three-year income and anticipated future earnings within the relevant jurisdiction. Accordingly, we reversed the related valuation allowance and recognized a discrete tax benefit of approximately $\n68\nmillion.\nOther factors that impacted our 2019 effective tax rate include favorable tax provisions enacted in the Taxpayer Certainty and Disaster Tax Relief Act of 2019.\nOther Items\nBeginning in 2012, we were granted a tax incentive for certain of our non-U.S. operations, which was effective through December 31, 2021. The tax incentive was conditioned upon our meeting specific employment and investment thresholds. The impact of this tax incentive decreased non-U.S. tax expense by $\n61\n, $\n35\nand $\n27\nmillion (increased diluted earnings per share by $\n0.07\n, $\n0.04\nand $\n0.03\n) for 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nDeferred income tax assets and liabilities are comprised of the following as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nThe valuation allowance changed by $\n34\n, $\n34\nand $(\n58\n) million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, respectively.\nWe have a U.S. federal capital loss carryforward of $\n185\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, $\n18\nmillion of which expires on December 31, 2025 and the remainder of which expires on December 31, 2026.\n116\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nFurther, we have U.S. state and local operating loss and credit carryforwards as follows (in millions):\nThe U.S. state and local operating loss carryforwards and credits can be carried forward for periods ranging from one year to indefinitely. We also have non-U.S. loss carryforwards of $\n674\nmillion as of December 31, 2021, the majority of which may be carried forward indefinitely. As indicated in the table above, we have established a valuation allowance for certain U.S. federal, state and non-U.S. carryforwards and outside basis differences due to the uncertainty resulting from a lack of previous taxable income within the applicable tax jurisdictions and other limitations.\nUndistributed earnings and profits (\"E&P\") of our foreign subsidiaries amounted to $\n5.4\nbillion as of December 31, 2021. Currently, $\n834\nmillion of the undistributed E&P of our foreign subsidiaries is considered to be indefinitely reinvested and, accordingly, no deferred income taxes have been provided thereon. Upon distribution of those earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise, we would be subject to U.S. state and local taxes and withholding taxes payable in various jurisdictions. Determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred income tax liability is not practicable because of the complexities associated with its hypothetical calculation.\nIn December 2017, the United States enacted into law the Tax Act, requiring a one-time transition tax on certain unrepatriated earnings of foreign subsidiaries. We elected to pay the tax over eight years based on an installment schedule outlined in the Tax Act. The remaining liability of $\n123\nmillion, to be paid between 2023 and 2025, is reflected as a non-current liability on the balance sheet.\nThe following table summarizes the activity related to our uncertain tax positions (in millions):\n117\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe total amount of gross uncertain tax positions as of December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate was $\n479\n, $\n332\nand $\n171\nmillion, respectively. Our continuing policy is to recognize interest and penalties associated with income tax matters as a component of income tax expense.\nWe file income tax returns in the U.S. federal jurisdiction, most U.S. state and local jurisdictions, and many non-U.S. jurisdictions. We have substantially resolved all U.S. federal income tax matters for tax years prior to 2016.\nA number of years may elapse before an uncertain tax position is audited and ultimately settled. It is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome or the timing of resolution for uncertain tax positions. It is reasonably possible that the liability for uncertain tax positions could significantly increase or decrease within the next twelve months. Items that may cause changes to uncertain tax positions include the timing of interest deductions and the allocation of income and expense between tax jurisdictions. These changes could result from the settlement of ongoing litigation, the completion of ongoing examinations, the expiration of the statute of limitations, or other unforeseen circumstances. At this time, an estimate of the range of the reasonably possible change cannot be made.\n118\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 17.\nEARNINGS PER SHARE\nThe earnings per share amounts are the same for class A and class B common shares as the holders of each class are legally entitled to equal per share distributions whether through dividends or in liquidation.\nThe following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share (in millions, except per share amounts):\nDiluted earnings per share for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 exclude the effect of\n0.1\n,\n0.6\nand\n0.5\nmillion shares, respectively, of common stock that may be issued upon the exercise of employee stock options because such effect would be antidilutive.\n119\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 18.\nDERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RISK MANAGEMENT\nRisk Management Policies\nChanges in fuel prices, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates impact our results of operations and we actively monitor these exposures. To manage the impact of these exposures, we may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments. Our objective is to manage, where it is deemed appropriate to do so, fluctuations in earnings and cash flows associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates, commodity prices and interest rates. It is our policy and practice to use derivative financial instruments only to the extent necessary to manage exposures. As we use price sensitive instruments to hedge a certain portion of our existing and anticipated transactions, we expect that any loss in value from those instruments generally would be offset by increases in the value of those hedged transactions. We do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.\nCredit Risk Management\nThe forward contracts, swaps and options discussed below contain an element of risk that the counterparties may be unable to meet the terms of the agreements; however, we seek to minimize such risk exposures for these instruments by limiting the counterparties to banks and financial institutions that meet established credit guidelines and by monitoring counterparties to prevent concentrations of credit risk with any single counterparty.\nWe have agreements with all of our active counterparties (covering the majority of our derivative positions) containing early termination rights and/or zero threshold bilateral collateral provisions whereby cash is required based on the net fair value of derivatives associated with those counterparties.\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we held cash collateral of $\n260\nand $\n146\nmillion, respectively, under these agreements. This collateral is included in\nCash and cash equivalents\nin the consolidated balance sheets and its use by UPS is not restricted. As of December 31, 2021,\nno\ncollateral was required to be posted with our counterparties. As of December 31, 2020, we were required to post $\n158\nmillion with our counterparties.\nEvents such as a counterparty credit rating downgrade (depending on the ultimate rating level) could also allow us to take additional protective measures such as the early termination of trades. Alternatively, we could be required to provide additional collateral or terminate transactions with certain counterparties in the event of a downgrade of our credit rating. The amount of collateral required would be determined by the net fair value of the associated derivatives with each counterparty. We have not historically incurred, and do not expect to incur in the future, any losses as a result of counterparty default.\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were\nno\ninstruments in a net liability position that were not covered by the zero threshold bilateral collateral provisions.\nTypes of Hedges\nCommodity Risk Management\nCurrently, the fuel surcharges that we apply to our domestic and international package are the primary means of reducing the risk of adverse fuel price changes on our business. In order to mitigate the impact of fuel surcharges imposed on us by outside carriers, we regularly adjust the rates we charge for our freight brokerage services.\nForeign Currency Risk Management\nTo protect against the reduction in value of forecasted foreign currency cash flows from our international package business, we maintain a foreign currency cash flow hedging program. Our most significant foreign currency exposures relate to the Euro, British Pound Sterling, Canadian Dollar, Chinese Renminbi and Hong Kong Dollar. We hedge portions of our forecasted revenue denominated in foreign currencies with forward contracts. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of anticipated foreign currency denominated revenue and, therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of international package revenue when the underlying sales transactions occur.\n120\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nWe also hedge portions of our anticipated cash settlements of intercompany transactions and interest payments on certain debt subject to foreign currency remeasurement using foreign currency forward contracts. We normally designate and account for these contracts as cash flow hedges of forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions; therefore, the resulting gains and losses from these hedges are recognized as a component of\nInvestment income (expense) and other\nwhen the underlying transactions are subject to currency remeasurement.\nWe hedge our net investment in certain foreign operations with foreign currency denominated debt instruments. The use of foreign denominated debt as the hedging instrument allows the debt to be remeasured to foreign currency translation adjustment within other comprehensive income to offset the translation risk from those investments. Balances in the cumulative translation adjustment accounts remain until the sale or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign entity, upon which they are recognized as a component of\nInvestment income (expense) and other\n.\nInterest Rate Risk Management\nOur indebtedness under our various financing arrangements creates interest rate risk. We use a combination of derivative instruments as part of our program to manage the fixed and floating interest rate mix of our total debt portfolio and related overall cost of borrowing. Interest rate swaps allow us to maintain a target range of floating-rate debt within our capital structure. The notional amount, interest payment date and maturity date of the swaps match the terms of the associated debt being hedged.\nWe have designated and account for the majority of our interest rate swaps that convert fixed-rate interest payments into floating-rate interest payments as fair value hedges of the associated debt instruments. Therefore, the gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to the interest rate swaps and fair value adjustments to the associated debt instruments are recorded to interest expense in the period in which the gains and losses occur. We have designated and account for interest rate swaps that convert floating-rate interest payments into fixed-rate interest payments as cash flow hedges of the forecasted payment obligations. The gains and losses resulting from fair value adjustments to these interest rate swaps are recorded to other comprehensive income.\nWe periodically hedge the forecasted fixed-coupon interest payments associated with anticipated debt offerings by using forward starting interest rate swaps, interest rate locks or similar derivatives. These agreements effectively lock a portion of our interest rate exposure between the time the agreement is entered into and the date when the debt offering is completed, thereby mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense. These derivatives are settled commensurate with the issuance of the debt, and any gain or loss upon settlement is amortized as an adjustment to the effective interest yield on the debt.\nOutstanding Positions\nThe notional amounts of our outstanding derivative positions as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 were as follows (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had\nno\noutstanding commodity hedge positions.\n121\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nOur fixed to floating interest rate swaps are designated as a fair value hedge of our\n2.450\n% fixed rate notes that mature in October 2022. These instruments utilize LIBOR as the reference rate to determine the floating interest rate to be paid. As these instruments will settle before the applicable U.S. Dollar LIBOR rate ceases to be published in June 2023, we have not evaluated the application of ASC Topic 848 to these instruments.\nBalance Sheet Recognition\nThe following table indicates the location in the consolidated balance sheets where our derivative assets and liabilities have been recognized, the fair value hierarchy level applicable to each derivative type and the related fair values of those derivatives.\nWe have master netting arrangements with substantially all of our counterparties giving us the right of offset for our derivative positions. However, we have not elected to offset the fair value positions of our derivative contracts recorded in the consolidated balance sheets. The columns labeled\nNet Amounts if Right of Offset had been Applied\nindicate the potential net fair value positions by type of contract and location in the consolidated balance sheets had we elected to apply the right of offset as of December 31, 2021 and December 31, 2020 (in millions):\nOur foreign currency exchange rate, interest rate and investment market price derivatives are largely comprised of over-the-counter derivatives, which are primarily valued using pricing models that rely on market observable inputs such as yield curves, currency exchange rates and investment forward prices; therefore, these derivatives are classified as Level 2. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020 we did\nno\nt have any derivatives that were classified as Level 1 (valued using quoted prices in active markets for identical assets) or Level 3 (valued using significant unobservable inputs).\n122\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nBalance Sheet Location of Hedged Item in Fair Value Hedges\nThe following table indicates the amounts that were recorded in the consolidated balance sheets related to cumulative basis adjustments for fair value hedges as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nThe cumulative amount of fair value hedging losses remaining for any hedged assets and liabilities for which hedge accounting has been discontinued as of December 31, 2021 is $\n5\nmillion. These amounts will be recognized over the next\n8\nyears.\nIncome Statement and AOCI Recognition\nThe following table indicates the amount of gains and (losses) that have been recognized in the statements of consolidated income for fair value and cash flow hedges, as well as the associated gain or (loss) for the underlying hedged item for fair value hedges for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\nThe following table indicates the amount of gains and (losses) that have been recognized in AOCI for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for those derivatives designated as cash flow hedges (in millions):\nAs of December 31, 2021, there were $\n70\nmillion of pre-tax gains related to cash flow hedges deferred in AOCI that are expected to be reclassified to income over the 12 month period ending December 31, 2022. The actual amounts that will be reclassified to income over the next 12 months will vary from this amount as a result of changes in market conditions. The maximum term over which we are hedging exposures to the variability of cash flows is approximately\n10\nyears.\n123\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nThe following table indicates the amount of gains and (losses) that have been recognized in AOCI within foreign currency translation adjustment for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 for those instruments designated as net investment hedges (in millions):\nAdditionally, we maintain interest rate swaps, foreign currency exchange forwards and investment market price forward contracts that are not designated as hedges. The interest rate swap contracts are intended to provide an economic hedge of portions of our outstanding debt. The foreign currency exchange forward contracts are intended to provide an economic offset to foreign currency remeasurement and settlement risk for certain assets and liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets. The investment market price forward contracts are intended to provide an economic offset to fair value fluctuations of certain investments in marketable securities.\nWe also periodically terminate interest rate swaps and foreign currency exchange forward contracts by entering into offsetting swap and foreign currency positions with different counterparties. As part of this process, we de-designate our original swap and foreign currency exchange contracts. These transactions provide an economic offset that effectively eliminates the effects of changes in market valuation.\nThe following is a summary of the amounts recorded in the statements of consolidated income related to fair value changes and settlements of these interest rate swaps, foreign currency forward and investment market price forward contracts not designated as hedges for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020 (in millions):\n124\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 19.\nTRANSFORMATION STRATEGY COSTS\nIn 2018, we launched a multi-year, enterprise-wide transformation strategy impacting our organization. The program includes investments, as well as changes in processes and technology, that impact global direct and indirect operating costs.\nThe table below presents the transformation strategy costs for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 (in millions):\nThe income tax effects of transformation strategy costs are calculated by multiplying the amount of the adjustments by the statutory tax rates applicable in each tax jurisdiction.\n125\nUNITED PARCEL SERVICE, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES\nNOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS\nNOTE 20.\nSUBSEQUENT EVENTS\nOn February 17, 2022, we announced the Canada Small Package Retirement Plan will cease accruals of additional benefits for future service and compensation for participants effective December 31, 2023. Upon adoption of the plan amendments, the elimination of defined benefit accruals for all current employees will trigger a pension curtailment event and the plan assets and pension benefit obligation will be remeasured.\n126"

Based upon, and as of the date of, the evaluation, our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer concluded that the disclosure controls and procedures were effective to ensure that information required to be disclosed in the reports we file and submit under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized and reported as and when required and is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our Principal Executive Officer and Principal Financial and Accounting Officer, as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\nThere were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2021 that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over financial reporting. We have not experienced any material impact to our internal controls over financial reporting despite the fact that more of our employees are working remotely during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. We have enhanced our oversight and monitoring during the closing and reporting processes and we continue to monitor and assess the effects of remote work on our internal controls to minimize the impact on their design and operating effectiveness.\nManagement’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting:\nUPS management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting for United Parcel Service, Inc. and its subsidiaries (the “Company”). Based on the criteria for effective internal control over financial reporting established in\nInternal Control-Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission, management has assessed our internal control over financial reporting as effective as of December 31, 2021. The independent registered public accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche LLP, as auditors of the consolidated balance sheets of United Parcel Service, Inc. and its subsidiaries as of December 31, 2021 and the related statements of consolidated income, consolidated comprehensive income and consolidated cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2021, has issued an attestation report on our internal control over financial reporting, which is included herein.\n127\nReport of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm\nTo the Shareowners and Board of Directors of\nUnited Parcel Service, Inc.\nAtlanta, Georgia\nOpinion on Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe have audited the internal control over financial reporting of United Parcel Service, Inc. and subsidiaries (the “Company”) as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (“COSO”). In our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in\nInternal Control — Integrated Framework (2013)\nissued by COSO.\nWe have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (“PCAOB”), the consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended December 31, 2021, of the Company and our report dated February 21, 2022, expressed an unqualified opinion on those financial statements.\nBasis for Opinion\nThe Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.\nWe conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.\nDefinition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\nBecause of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.\n/s/ Deloitte & Touche LLP\nAtlanta, Georgia\nFebruary 21, 2022\n128"
